2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ~Lulhm9mWWcgndcuc_zsgPA~Favorite vintage store I have been in. I have been going to a lot lately looking for midcentury furniture that won't empty out my bank account. Happened to drive by this place and decided to take a look. I got a 3 piece coffee table and side tables set for 60 bucks. Can't beat that. The lady working I completely loved! She was helpful and let me know what kind of stuff will be coming in. This will be a weekly stop for me.  If you are looking for awesome vintage furniture in good shape this is the place to go. They know their stuff. A lot of awesome lamps and boomerang coffee tables. It is a must visit.  update: seems like items are getting higher and higher. style has changed a bit. still nice stuff if you wanna empty your bank account. no longer a weekly stop but i will still  stop by.~coffee coffee ~4
0czfEgv9KAD4VlIa7ANPWQ~U617X1icAyAC5hbjsnhcpA~Overall, I'll never go back. Rewinding to the reason of my conclusion: messy racks, bad choice on jewelry, no focus on fits whatsoever, no pricing consistency, and paint-scraping help from the hired help (owner of Red). I felt like I was bothering someone instead of shopping.   I recommend Retro Ranch, Fashion by Robert Black, France's or the new Vintage shop next to Hula's and Lola Coffee on Central Ave.~coffee ~1
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~6-hKBi-6RC3g7Mft0c-6qw~This place is a area staple! Been around for years and not much has changed - I see this as a good thing! Stable and reliable!  My family goes every year for St. Pattys Day corn beef! Very nice place for a bar night dinner, or to catch up with some friends over drinks!~corn beef ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~8Mu56iQ-MYEyivqUVss0XA~Don't go here for the decor, but the staff is friendly and the fried pickles are very tasty.  Good value.~fried pickles ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~ToC77cIEiMas9CPU7dt_fA~I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed.   One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price! Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app. The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection. They got the spears vs. chips decision right!  The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share!    And here's the kicker they were under four bucks!   Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!  The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft! And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.    I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.  The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done. When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share. My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.  The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.  Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented! I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.  That move garnered the fifth star!  We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!~fries, broccoli, fried pickles ~5
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~T5Xa-KKFqgXdbFnATZA4gg~THE CLASSIC BURGER IS AMAZING.  It's definitely a top ten burger. The fries are good too.~classic burger ~5
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~4FnZR30PtlEb1Ifi7S65bg~Okay bar food. Nice bar setting but food is average, service is average and in general doesn't really art itself apart in anything. Would I go there again? Probably if I'm in the area. Would I go out of my way to go there or make note of it to others? Probably not vegetable soup was good though and wings were fairly priced.~soup ~3
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~6GBjCBVtPGsnQ67neAAkjw~Was boozin and cruisin with my canine comrade. Went all the way out to Hudson via Brecksville/82. Looking for anything to Yelp. Nothing. Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.  Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men. I won't wait four more years to come back.~sandwich mushrooms, beef fries ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~FFTN8Y1U9G2F_p1dQnxO7A~Okay, so it is a bar with an old fashioned family restaurant attached. We were there almost 2 hours for the Tuesday night burger special. They need more staff. The table was a little sticky. However, the food was delicious. The French fries were nice and crispy, and the Half pound burger didn't taste like a pre-made frozen patty. Our total bill was $15.30 for 2 meals and 2 Cokes. We'll definitely go back.~burger french fries ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~VlDz03s9VyODcVi1S9-Yfw~3 stars is fair for this pub.   The food is good and well priced for a bar.   Tuesday has $5 burgers and chicken sandwiches.   The pecan pie is good for dessert.   I got the chicken dinner, it came with a 6 oz chicken, broccoli, steamed potatoes, salad, and roll. It was ok. I'd stick with the burgers though. The salad was fresh.   Their fries are really good.~burgers chicken sandwiches. pie chicken chicken, broccoli, steamed potatoes, ~3
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~YGfi1F_Fuc_OyemfqQFspg~Have dined in twice now and today was take out for corned beef sandwich. I don't know why I keep thinking this place is going to change. Food is at best "ok". The inside is a dive needs some serious updating. This would be ok if this place was a hidden dive bar with amazing food- not the case. Today's lunch- puke. Dry corned beef, probably the worst I ever have had.  Lession learned never returning.~corned beef ~1
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~FM3Uo0F_2BHp1JdxR5nqvQ~This small tavern, has great burgers and the best fries within 100 miles!  It's simple, unpretentious, and the folks are mellow and ready to accommodate their customers.  I understand they added music on the weekend and will surely check it out on the weekend.~burgers fries ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~uVdnYmlXio7BqtfmZZU-0w~Went here last Friday for dinner very disappointed!  Waited for ever for someone to tell us to seat ourselves and then waited forever for the waitress to come over it seemed they were very busy gossiping at the counter.  Food was so-so nothing special the salads good use cheese served very plain.  Better restaurants nearby.~salads cheese ~2
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~f0l_4MrqYjVCOZq_PowquQ~I can't give this palce 5 stars because hell, its just not a 5 star place.  But it's the Pickle!  If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap, quality food (you get what you pay for though), a typical old bar atmosphere, free popcorn, and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5.  The place is awesome, I'm there every weekend.~popcorn, ~4
4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw~QfnIyQ5wYk2NDWSLYkSbgQ~Great prices.   Good food. Typical fare: burgers chicken, fish, etc  Really friendly and eccentric staff. This place is a keeper.   Try the hot pickle. I buy them and use them in bloody marys.~burgers chicken, ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~2tjghSImOPf4A9L4zhByRQ~Ah, Khotan... I knew you when (SIGH) you were something different.... a perfect blend of Asia's decor and food... and how far you have fallen since that time. While I still appreciate your service and your stunning looks, I am surprised by what has happened to your menu... sorry looking sashimi (though the uni was a standout... shouts out to Santa Barbara!!), uninspired hot foods (kung pao shrimp at $21? For real?? ).... even the drinks are sorry in comparison to what once was.... SIGH.  Perhaps this is why you are closing your doors from November 30th through January 3rd (Seriously? During one of the busiest times of the year in Vegas!?) At least you still have your Treasure Island pirate show, which will always be a sight to behold. Perhaps you should visit what you once were (read: Social House at Crystals) and reclaim your glorious days. Until then, I will continue to hold onto hope that you will find your spotlight (or at least a better menu) once again.~shrimp ~3
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~fCVQlHk6x7-S2FWWMbOWpA~Khotan sucks as a place to eat. The girls and I went to this place for "Dinner" but really all we got was appetizers. We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper, but it don't mean the size is bigger. I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all. The roll were so tiny it was about the size of a quarter and I got four of those. BOO times 2. The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender. They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free. Atmosphere is really not impressive either.~appetizers. tuna ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~N42b2u6YSL5iEjN6NnrKeQ~My boyfriend and I decided to go resturant hunting on our visit in LV for our 1 year anniversary..we didnt have a spot in mind but on our many, many, many walks on the strip we found Khotan.   So I decided to call and make a reservation since I didnt know whether it was a forsure spot we would get in for dinner. *WHICH I DO RECOMMEND, BTW!* We got there and were greeted and waited in the longue/bar area..it was def cute, we were soon taken to our seats in the patio area (which i also do recommend esp if you come around the 9 o' clock time frame for the pirates show.) OMG, when were going up there are beautiful gold deposit boxes all around then you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show..feels  like the fireworks are going to hit you haha.  The food was great, me and my bf def recommend the chicken lollipops for a appetizer (get two bc i could finish that whole plate if i didnt have to share with my bf HAHAHA). You def wont regret it, I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good! I wish it did have a little more but I was full forsure. My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there...just b/c hes def a fattie. haha  Overall, great place for some pan Asian food, GREAT SERVICE btw!, great views, free show of the pirate show w/o the bussling of the crowds, patio seating is great and def a great overall resturant in vegas.~chicken khotan beef ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~3r40NTxUZyjPI26ftFaHaw~***for lounge only****  Maybe I like this place only because my friend and I stumbled upon this place during happy hour.  Oh the two best words ever.  We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear.  I liked mine since it's tart as I like it but my friend didn't care for it. She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet.  We were going to have dinner so we didn't splurge on appetizers but the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices.  I took a peek and it looked like it was good since they ate every bite of their sushi rolls.  Bartender was really nice as well.  Noted, maybe on a weekend this place is poppin' but I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night.~cranberry asian pear ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~sSuy_QaLPKX99kSGy1QwHA~I love the decor and vibe of Khotan. A little hard to find at first but once you enter, it's worth the search. I really liked the safe deposit boxes in the entryway - made for some cute pictures.  Food: Yum! I think it *may* be hit or miss based on reading other reviews but we chose wisely. Here's what I liked: Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fish Curry noodles - love the curry they used, definitely singaporean. big shrimps.  Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors. Service: Great! Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food. This would be a great date spot. I'll be back to enjoy the atmosphere :)~tuna roll - shrimps. ginger chicken broccoli - date ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~tebBZw0NttA_4xjV10k1xA~Worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size of a box of Tic Tacs with chewy rice and a rectangular layer of raw fish on the top. Bland, difficult to eat. We were hoping it was the same chef as Social House (restaurant at what is now Khotan's spot) because there was a jalapeno yellowtail sashimi on the menu (like the amazing one we'd had at Social House two years ago). The jalapeno yellowtail sashimi was actually excellent. The rest of the meal was totally downhill. When we started walking upstairs to get our table, the maitre 'd called out, "Watch your step because if you fall, I'd have to laugh at you." So, they can't make sushi and they have some clueless staffers too. Don't waste your time or if you insist on going, try the hot foods versus the sushi rolls.~sushi jalapeno jalapeno sushi sushi ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~ud02HHp2XgjV8d4xBm4eIw~My girlfriend and I stayed at TI and we were looking for an easy dinner one night, so we decided to stroll into Khotan.  Meh...  I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good.  I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish.  It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish.  Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!  The service was pretty good, but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish.  Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.  The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good, but when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense.  I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein.  It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top.  I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good, or better, than their $14 dish.~sushi tuna salmon lo mein. ramen noodles ramen noodles ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~mUPdz50uiC_kPsEH8A9_Ew~Only 4 stars because of the expense--without our $55 Groupon, our meal for two, including one large house sake, would have been over $100.  However, even if we hadn't had the Groupon, it would have been WELL worth the money. What a find!! The decor is gorgeous, we were waited on by two attentive garcons (sat at the sushi bar so chatted with the sushi chefs as well), and the menu is extremely creative and--most importantly--DELICIOUS.   Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light, yummy sauce and WOW was he right. We both "mm'd" through our whole meal, starting right from the tasty beginning.   Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh, generous and absolutely fantastic.   By the time we finished our large dinner order we were almost full, but definitely not ready to stop eating! We each ordered another round of nigiri--my boyfriend got tuna and I got salmon, YUM!  What a hidden gem...thanks to Groupon for helping us find this one! We will DEFINITELY be returning next time we're in Vegas.~sushi sushi tempura sushi ( sushi) tuna salmon, ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~5amEF7AHj87DXTEvblEw8Q~Sushi was very average and very expensive with no wow factor. Tasted just "bleh". Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat. Took a long time to get the salad. We asked to sit on the balcony to watch the show and they gave us a table at the backside so we couldn't see. Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long.~sushi miso soup ginger salad lettuce salad. ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~D0JqU2amlbvcDdsB1wQuHw~I can't say from my experience that I understand the mediocre reviews for Khotan. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We didn't have the sushi and stuck to mainstream pekinese type dishes; lettuce wraps, edamame (ok, they're Japaneze), lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken, all of which were fresh and tasty.   I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint. It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal. I am going to brutally honest here and suggest what is expensive to a TI guest is not the same to a Bellagio one ( we are neither by the way).   Give this place a try. We really liked it.~sushi lettuce wraps ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~U_P13SRuczdXTYD1zgu96Q~Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it.  I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.  The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.  We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.  We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was "eh," very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.  I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service, but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back.  If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view, however, this is your place.~chicken, orange chicken ~3
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~Ulb1lFkd2EjXiXk_8lIsDQ~We stumbled upon khotan by pure laziness...We were watching the TI show (wow...not kid friendly anymore) and gambled a little before we started getting some hunger pangs.  So we wandered a little bit and saw the downstairs opening for this place.  We thought it was a small casual place and had no idea it was considered upscale dining.  The host greeted us then talked into his ear radio....He then escorted us to the elevator and sent us up.  We were then greeted by another host and seated in the bar area since it was a quiet sunday night.  We just needed a few bites to eat so we could make our flight without starving.  Started off w. some edamame (the norm, nothing crazy) then we shared chicken lollipops (not bad), kobe sliders (looked dry but were actually moist), gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which but it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles...terrible).  It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location...right in front of us as we were about to give up looking...  Food was good but not memorable. (well except the super awful noodle dish)~edamame ( chicken rice noodles... ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~3oy99xSSdewIQxS3Vc4M6A~The restaurant was pretty slick, great atmosphere and a really cool patio. If you happen to go for dinner the pirate show is pretty cool since you are watching it from the back side of the boats. The Edamame was really buttery and apps were spot on. The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet.   The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place. The food was so so, but the drinks, app and atmosphere were great.    Worth a visit and they frequently have Groupons and happy hour specials.~edamame ginger ~3
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~keG92lC9WWLPvRn1Yne8Sg~We used a Groupon to try out this restaurant in TI.  We sat at a table on the patio to watch the 8pm Sirens show.    Pros: - nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.) - decent variety of food selections and full bar - decor and ambience were pretty nice  Cons: - food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.   - service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.  She disappeared for a bit while we ate and my husband had to go to the kitchen to get more soy sauce.  We eventually had to call out the Mgr to ask for service, and things got better after that.  He was very apologetic and checked in to make sure things were OK.    I think if we hadn't had the Groupon, we would have not come here.  Without the Groupon, we would have spent the $200 elsewhere and received much better quality food and service.  I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour.~chicken, california roll lettuce wraps ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~NkJM5LxehFqgsIB7LPBiCg~I ate at Khotan tonight with my husband, sister-in-law and her husband. We were there to use our Groupons before they expired.The service was really good. So was the lighting. We ordered the sliders, Tom Yum with chicken and the crispy asparagus to start. The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended. The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick. We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the "fry."  For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp. All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama. We were expecting it to be hot. It was cold. Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp. Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad. Just wasn't what we were expecting.  Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense.   The restaurant is beautiful. Worth a try. Don't expect miracles.~chicken asparagus ginger asparagus rice krispies thai ( khotan beef ~3
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~vbuArRtzxYv6c359wj07mA~This place is weird.  So we were greeted by the hostess in front who looked like she was wearing butt pads.  No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here?   The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.    I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average.   Even if money grew on my orange tree, I wouldn't come here again though.~sushi ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~H8SsK_SsLZSh6XycXxlINw~What a waste of time and money.  We had dinner thinking that the chef from Social House was still there but I guess I should have read the other reviews posted by yelpers.  I guess if I had to describe the restaurant it would by con-fusion...horrible creations that make you think twice about eating there (salmon parmesan roll, crab lo mein Alfredo, wtf?).  Terribly expensive and it seemed that the staff didn't care too much about what was going on around them.~salmon lo mein ~1
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~ws3sKm5MrtZEDEsjCgOAJg~Not worth the money. Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food. The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had. It made the $35 roll taste even worse. The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs.Service was good. Decor was very nice. It takes alot  for me to say these things about any place. Good luck.~mongolian beef ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~6ye4tUGnj1lmhm_kvK_sPg~Recently ate at Khotan. The food was quite good. I had the cashew chicken and my wife had sweet and sour chicken. While somewhat expensive, and the service a bit slow, it was a good experience overall especially with the Groupon discount saving us $25.~cashew chicken ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~maELoO1vbOSzztlEgCdDWQ~Much MUCH better as Social House.  What the hell was TI thinking?  SH was more Japanese influenced, I would say Khotan is more Chinese influenced, with a Japanese pricetag.    Grub: *Jalapeno Hamachi, not as buttery & fresh as I'm used to, soy overpowered, I liked the battered jalapeno slices, great texture, $22 *Rainbow Roll, snow crab & fish were not fresh, $18 *Broccoli Beef, liked the Broccoli Rabe aspect, the beef was eh, $24 *Gai Lan, cooked nicely, & not too greasy, $6 *Crab Lo Mein Alfredo, really strange, like the powdered packet in Hamburger Helper, but oddly comforting, $14  This place is pretty pathetic, but they serve a mean cocktail & boast a great alfresco dining option.~jalapeno jalapeno broccoli beef, broccoli beef lo mein hamburger ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~N6sCtNlRnXsvWX8TwNDIUg~Was craving sushi after walking around the outdoor mall at Treasure Island. Just happened to come across this place. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily good either. Decor is nice, service is average, the bartender was cool though. For the price they charge I would pass on this place. I know it's Vegas but there's some standards you would expect based on the price and the food just didn't meet the standards in my opinion.~sushi ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~ilVcRwYNopvGus0yR_2zZw~I came here back when it was social house, and now Khotan. I tell you it's like night and day. And I don't mean that in a good way. While the decor hasn't really changed much. The menu sure has and not for the better. My experience here while being social house was so wonderful. I figured regardless of the name changing I'd give it a shot. Boy was I wrong. Like I mentioned before the decor is still unique. Dim, sheik, very Asian like of course. But wait, they use to have a dj in the lounge area. Gone, go figure. And the waitresses from what I remember were a lot nicer. Anyway. I ordered a few sushi pieces, with some chicken like kabobs. I believe a salad. Had a few beers. Sushi was very Mediocre. Chicken was dry. Salad was salad. Can't really remember anything memorable from my meal. Aside from the overpriced food. A big disappointment. I doubt I'll be coming here again. Only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because it was once social house. Anyway if over priced wanna be asian food is your gig. Along with half ass service. Be my guest.~sushi chicken kabobs. salad. sushi chicken salad salad. ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~4zVgAV6cGM5i0RWzBh7n5g~Mediocre food. 50$ for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.~chicken ~2
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~FTx10AG-Ipaldnb3A8ZMcg~Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It has a cool atmosphere, but it's super expensive and the food is so-so for the price you pay. It's also super dark, so it's hard to read the menus. This is probably to hide that you're paying $45 for a few pieces of steak.   If you're here at the right time, Treasure Island's pirate show will play right outside your window, so you can listen to the cannons and fireworks go off while you're eating a romantic dinner. That could be a good or bad thing depending on your personality.~steak. ~3
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~AZJx5c1QV8rKDTEL6-GTng~While looking for a restaurant on the strip that had excellent decor and a romantic atmosphere, but at the same time a reasonable price, i found Khotan. The service was good, our waiter was very social and always kept our drinks filled. I tried out the orange peel beef and my girlfriend tried out the Khotan beef both were very delicious dishes, but me being a fat ass was still hungry after since there isn't very much in the plate.  what i suggest:  1. Eat out in the patio if you are going to be there at nightfall, Khotan is right above the pirate show at T.I.  2. Chicken lollipops! really good appetizer~beef khotan beef ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~yfF0bUmR65iOGw0QefGSPA~My four stars are for the lounge area and the food.  The service in the dining area was lame.  The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game.   We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.  The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.  We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.  The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.  We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.)   So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, "Sorry 'bout the wait" would have sufficed.  Oh well.  Good thing the food is so good. I'm dreamin about that pad thai. Mmmmm...~tuna roll -- thai soup. soup chicken. soup... soup. thai ginger thai. ~4
4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A~HTolWbNJUULt5u_bWne1IQ~The best description I can give about this restaurant is that it is the Panda Express of asian food and not worth the price.  For appetizer we had the crispy asparagus. It was just japanese crackers deepfried around asparagus. Too weird of a texture but okay to eat. Only 6 sticks. So to me, 6 asparagus heads is not worth that price.  I got the lobster curry. Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect.   hubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.  the place is also really dark, to the point where you cannot read your menu. you have to put the menu an inch away from the candle on your table. lame.  and the TI sirens show in the background is VERY annoying.  skip this place. and TI, please don't make lame asian restaurants. it's an insult to the main demographic of your casino.~asparagus. asparagus. asparagus thai pork ~2
2cl9TETYE3CdzljPtdIbjA~VIJJmHxrmfZQDeFG1DvtsQ~Best place for fries! Breakfast sandwiches! Hot Meals! I didn't realize everything is made in house from scratch!!!!!! From the hummus, salads, pasta and pasta sauce!!!! The Chicken Shawarma  sandwich is like nothing you have had before! It's juicy, fresh and huge!!! Also! Ladies it doesn't fall apart!!!! Great lunch place!!!! I personally am a fan of the falafel sandwich! They stick French fries in it for me!!! Also, the people that work there are very sweet, humble and down right good!   This place is more like family! They know everyone by name!  You walk in and instantly greeted with great service. They give you time to decide and help you customize if needed.   On several occasions I have gone into the restaurant in a rush between meetings and they are fast!!!! Which I appreciate. I have brought in a few clients with me and they never disappointed with the food. Always consistent.   If you are in the area.. Give them a try!!!! They ROCK!!!!!!~fries! sandwiches! salads, pasta pasta chicken sandwich sandwich! french fries ~5
2cl9TETYE3CdzljPtdIbjA~u5NBtqEHaH3gqMZMWjDRbw~First time going here. Great food. I had a whole wheat chicken shawarma. Was really good and refreshing and filling. Will be going back in the future.~wheat chicken ~4
2cl9TETYE3CdzljPtdIbjA~FfmIzwjKbVDDa3LpWLz3Ew~This restaurant is all about good home cooking. Wonderful spices, excellent quality and care taken. Lots of repeat customers are seen at Sami's!! I love their coleslaw and very fresh ingredients are used!!~coleslaw ~5
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~0D3-2UM5-AEl5RdZ1Ggb2A~Bring a sweater and leggings/pants with you, because this place is freezing! There's something wrong with their ventilation/air-conditioning system. It might be warmer if you sit next to the grill.  The sushi is always good but I've never had the grill. It's a great place to get together with friends, family or colleagues for any group event. Children's birthday parties are celebrated a lot here. I plan on celebrating mine here in September.~sushi ~4
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~NlLMeXZMLwbAQMYrWgMldA~Toyo, Toyo, Toyo... where do I begin. I was first introduced to this place 4 years ago, for my friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef/performer.   I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.  I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.  It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward!   I'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do.~soup, salad ~3
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~ZqZSFxr0zFUkcs3fy2U75w~Great staff, great location and great food. The chefs are amazing and make the experience memorable. Great Japanese food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date or even a party.~date ~4
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~Rdq1Oor3pRdt49vPKSCGSQ~bit pricey but great for groups. Not sure if it's good for dates. Food: teriyaki chicken was great! Shimps and beef were ok. It's just salt-pepper and soy sauce in cooked food. No special spices/exotic ingredients. Portions are ok, too.  3 starts just because it's entertainment else i'd have given this 1 star based on just food.~chicken beef soy sauce ~3
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~2real3qYD9cMzEbiif8fBw~Such a cool environment .. its awesome for partys snd the chefs always entertaining the guests I find it a very new york feeling... I love it. The food is great and so are the drinks , we went once for sushi .. it was great!! So fresh and clean.~sushi .. ~5
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~5d4xheQxd4usav48PK5mlQ~It's a really nice restaurant , very similar to benihannas if anyone is interested ...I ended up getting the jumbo shrimp & it was made to perfection anyone that loves Chinese food would understand~shrimp & ~5
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~k6FEqpmoxlH5eMTPFDaZVw~I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel. My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get sushi here, the main attraction is the Teppanyaki.  As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat you with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.  Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).  Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).  We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show.~sushi steak ~5
7HnlXTF9f29HOYfblGLIHQ~-xYc7VzpQYS6Vw1nbN6axA~I  have been going to this place regularly for over ten years. It is consistently awesome. I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fiancé and I are seated at a table alone which is nice.   Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fiancé doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).    In terms of the "show" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive.   This place is our go-to when we want a filling, casual and awesome meal. I highly recommend it.~chicken shrimp ~5
-3pfhzz9CB7F2DpbF1Ko7Q~H7eJZ9azd1eH5minOhc-uw~This Bar Restaurant is a wide open airy space within the Apex |International Hotel.We booked a table for Fathers Day Lunch. I have to say the food was excellent, the service was very good & value for money on the Sunay Lunch menu was excellent. The soup was piping hot, the Roast beef melted in the mouth! Didn't have room for puds but they looked fantastic~soup beef ~5
-3pfhzz9CB7F2DpbF1Ko7Q~fTLZIeehPoPe_vv8NVS51g~Attached to the hotel my parents were staying in, Metro was restaurant of choice for a quick - but classy - meal before they were to return home a few hours later.  Metro is, I admit - a beautiful restaurant, modern, clean and bright. But my compliments will end there.  The meals were expensive, somewhat tasteless, tiny and my soup starter left an odd coating in my mouth for the rest of the meal. The staff were rude and unhelpful, bearly conceling thier bordom and hate for thier jobs. Service was so slow that I counted my dad checking his watch more than once with fear for missing the plane in two hours time. Not the best.  Now, I am willing to admit, we may have just been there at the wrong time or something, but still, it was an awful experience which I will not want to repeat.~soup ~1
-3pfhzz9CB7F2DpbF1Ko7Q~k5aSkCKZ7jhZcD3a5cy_Ag~Had dinner here in december last year, it was close to my friends apt and we just went there because we didn't want to go far. Food was nice, a bit pricey though, I had Orzo pasta, sun blushed tomato, rocket, parmesan & pine nuts, the pesto on it could've had less oil on it as I found quite greasy even for a pesto based sauce. It came with a nice salad so this was a good surprise.  We had a nice rose wine and service was alright.~orzo pasta, tomato, salad ~3
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~gfKsjg4aouCOND-0c2tCqw~Here tonight to try dinner. What caught my eye was the nachos and bratzel with fries. Should have just had the nachos as that was a meal in itself. If you have ever had Big Dogs' nachos you know what I am talking about. The order is so big, it would easily feed four or so. We asked them for a half order and still it was a huge portion. They layer the cheese in between the chips and pile on the sour cream, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes and guacamole. You can add meat like chicken, taco seasoned beef, or shredded beef for just a little bit more.   Once they have it all together under the salamander it goes and it's heated all the way through. So the chips on the bottom are just as warm, crunchy and smothered in cheese as the ones in the middle and on top.   My bratzel is a hamburger with bacon, bratwurst sausage, crispy thin rings of onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and of course the pretzel roll. Cut this baby up into four's it's enormous. I enjoy Big Dog's its always fun to dine in or late night, eat at the bar.~nachos fries. nachos nachos cheese chips sour cream, chicken, taco beef, beef chips cheese hamburger bacon, sausage, onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese, ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~knj38uLWTjl1tfjHn0Jw-g~I had lunch here and it was very chill. I enjoyed that everyone was doing their own thing and the bartender that helped us was very nice. The food is pretty good. I had the club sandwich and my friend has this MASSIVE bratzel thing. It was giant. I have no idea how he ate it all. How anyone could eat that whole thing, but it is possible.   I did not enjoy a beer, but they have a nice selection. This will probably not be the last time me and Big Dog will share a meal, next time we will share a drink... or four.~sandwich ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~fg3_ksx1w3OEB9POwUlAmg~I love that the dining room is non-smoking but it's not enclosed. I really dig the selection of brews here too. They have a great chocolate porter right now and the lake mead monster is a good amber that packs a punch with a 9.1% abv without too much bitterness. IMO, you can't go wrong with either.   I had the fish sandwich with garlic fries. The fried fish was good and you get 2 large fillets on the bun. It comes with tartar sauce and fries but you can get garlic or sweet potato fries for $1 more. I always get the sweet potato waffle fries and they are worth the extra buck.   The service is never bad and the beer is always cold. They really didn't do anything in particular to loose a star. I'm just at a loss with the indoor smoking. Is it too much to ask to get good food, service and beer in a clean air environment? Apparently so. Never the less, I like this place and I will be back.~sandwich garlic fries. fried fish fries garlic sweet potato ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~hnEB3NkryrZfG1_Tu58zdw~If I give Draft House Big Dogs 5 stars, the Big Dogs on Sahara deserves a 4 star review at least.  The beer is brewed at the Draft House location on Rancho, but its just as fresh here.  In fact, when the special brews run out at the Draft House, you can often find them here or at the Nellis location for another week or two.  The bar food is good too.  The menu is slightly different, but pretty much the same as the Draft House.  The only thing is that sometimes the restaurant has slow service on weekends.  This never used to be a problem, but lately when I have gone it has been.  However, after a few Dirty Dog IPA's, this is easily forgiven.    Try the cheese curds, and the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The fries are awesome too.  Overall, this smaller version of the Draft House has the best beer brewed in Las Vegas (at their Rancho location), and pretty darn good bar food.  This is a regular hang out for me and my coworkers.~cheese cheese steak ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~pZIQPxbBOyR-waeBh_BA4Q~The week of May 14-20, 2012 is National Beer Week. Any of their brews are $2 off. A pint of their beer is less than $3 for this week. It does not matter what time because this special is a 24/7 promotion. I tried the 38 special which is a blend of two different beers. It was smooth and enjoyable.   Pair any of these cold drafts with one of their monster burgers and satisfaction is sure to ensue. I got the Tex-Mex; a thick burger topped with a grilled green pepper, cheese, bacon, crispy sweet onion straws, and a BBQ sauce. With a side of their sweet potato fries for an additional $1 hit the spot. Although the fries were cold, the burger more than made up for it. My friend ordered the Big Dog burger and something else came out. In the end, we split both burgers to help alleviate his disappointment. Instead, we were both very happy. Maybe just closing my eyes and pointing would not be a bad option.~burgers burger cheese, bacon, onion sweet potato ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~EflHr_TIPcKQ13R3jeT9FA~We wanted to find a place open for lunch that was casual. My husband was craving a burger so we found Big Dogs (it was Christmas day). We both ordered burgers and they were delicious! Juicy, large and all the toppings were fresh (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) (posted pictures of the food, but not sure where they are...check my profile maybe.)  My 5 year old also had a burger and enjoyed it all. He is a big fan...as now when we drive by the place he yells "Big Dogs!"  The service was really professional and friendly. The place is very clean and a nice casual atmosphere. We will definitely go back (this was our first visit). It was Christmas afternoon so the place was pretty empty. We enjoyed that it was this way! No wait, immediate seating and no loud noises. They were also playing highlights of football (especially the Steelers ;-) .   We look forward to trying other menu items and would consider going to some of their events they advertise. Great burgers!~burger burgers lettuce, burger burgers! ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~o7TonWk0W294aw78cZ_HzQ~My brother  and I hit up Big Dogs one night around the holiday season to grab a bite, and escape the holiday craziness that sometimes exists. It was after 9, and we were seated in the bar. Not a whole heck of a lot of people around but it was the holiday time. Obviously, as a vegetarian, a place like this doesn't provide a whole lot of options, so I went with a couple apps. My brother, a meat eater extraordinaire had the pulled pork sandwich. My apps were pretty gross deep fried average bar food. My brother wasn't happy with the very gristly pulled pork. The highlight for me was the beer. I got the sampler, and quite enjoyed the Red Hydrant. The other beers were pretty so so, but the Red Hydrant hit the spot. I don't think food will ever be an option here, but I'd give it a second chance for the beer.~pulled pork ~2
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~Rtl9BoHojeBOY1IPEBJ68A~Third time here. Food can be hit or miss.  Good sometimes and meh others.   The beers are decent.  The bar area is mysteriously Smokey even went vacant.   I was hoping for more sausage are on the menu since they are packers fans. Also, considered taking a star for the same reason. Lol~sausage ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~KOOKHliWl-Cq14kmK8xKdg~Well, it is what it is: a dingy, divey looking place and very unimaginative. Nothing against Big Dog's because it's not their fault but the smoking is a deal-breaker for me under any circumstances, even friends.  My friend had some fries and they were OK. I ate a few and that was about it. The server was very friendly and attentive so I have to give her that.  If you have to put up with smoking in just about every establishment in Las Vegas, you might as well go for a little class. This place is very short on any amount of that. I suppose it's OK to visit with friends just to slam a few. I've never done the restaurant side so I can't comment on that. It's pretty standard, as sports bars go.~fries ~3
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~8fB1e214r7ItEl16Hcq60A~I had lunch here with my son the other day.  I had a great beer and and great patty melt with garlic fries.  UMMM, just thinking about it makes me hungry.  He goes here with the guys from work often.  Next time I will try the black and blue burger.  Great service, knowledgeable staff.~patty garlic fries. burger. ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~mLjXr-_-jz7Zmz_KvgEaEQ~On the look out for a new place to try for Sunday football specials, we decided to finally try Big Dog's.   We sat at the bar to be able to view a few of the games and were greeted warmly by the bartender. She was very friendly and helpful, guiding us through all the specials and giving her recommendations. We decided to start with a couple of pints of Leglifter beer and some hot wings. The beer was their own brew and a pretty good deal. The wings had a nice flavor and we enjoyed them quite a bit. We decided to order some more and went with the honey hot flavor, which were our personal flavor. Spicy, sweet and delicious.We also upped the ante with some Patron margaritas they had on special. Very strong, but still pretty good.   Overall, the food isn't amazing but it was pretty good and the service and the deals were pretty good. Not the best place to view football, unless there are only one or two games you want to see at a time. They only have a few TVs scattered around and it's not easy to see all the games simultaneously. I'll definitely be back to try them again some time soon, though.~honey ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~wZvl8ThLdbdjpN7COXx_vw~I like Big Dog's, even though I'm not a beer drinker.  This visit was our Friday Night group's choice for dinner.  The food was mostly great, the service very lacking (e.g.,hree requests to the waitress for water???).  I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich on foccacia, which came with roasted peppers, mozzarella, and yum, sauteed spinach and garlic.  It would have been outstanding if they'd only heated the foccacia to crisp it up.  Instead of the fries or cole slaw, I sprang for the extra two bucks to change it up for a salad.  I expected a tiny side salad, but this was really big, with lots of chopped tomatoes, cuke, cheese, and romaine.  It was missing olives, but that was great:  I hate olives!  By the time I got halfway through the salad, I felt like I'd already eaten dinner.  My husband ordered the walleye special.  I thought it was pretty high-priced at $20, but it came with the aforementioned salad, plus two sides. But when they brought out the plate, I saw the reason for the high price: the piece of fish was absolutely monstrous.  It could have fed a small third-world nation, but my husband lives to eat, so he managed to devour half of it before throwing in the towel.  It became my dinner on Saturday night, and I thought it was fabulous!  I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't over-salted.  Next time we go we'll both order it, and we'll be able to eat for a week!  One of the other couples ordered the same as us.  The guy from the third couple had the burger with bratwurst and, I think, bacon, plus some kind of cheese.  He liked it a lot.  His wife wasn't feeling very well, so she just ordered some tuna salad on a plate.  The waitress was friendly when she took our order, but then disappeared.  Luckily, the bus person was pretty efficient, and saved the day.  Make that evening.~chicken sandwich ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~12JpDvtr4ZYFngGV6Kv-aQ~Despite the fact that Vegas has a stupid number of local's tavern type places per capita (arguably way too many), Big Dog's gets 2 thumbs up from me for their large creative menu.   I finally made it over here for lunch today after years of working in the area. With all the sports bar hopping my husband and I do during football season, taverns usually aren't my first choice for lunch. Today a burger topped with a brat and bacon just *sounded* good, so off to Big Dog's we went.   My coworker got a brat, I got the insane brat/burger/bacon thing, and my husband got pulled pork sliders. First off, they get props for all the choices of sides - fries, garlic fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, salad, potato salad, cole slaw.. OMG, so happy! I love choices. I ended up with the sweet potato fries and they ended up being SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES. Best sweet potato fries ever. Seriously.   My ridiculous burger topped with a brat, and cheese, and onion strings, and bacon was amazing. I'm not sure if the burger meat itself was good because I was in topping heaven. I ate 1/3rd of it and was too full to continue. Insanely tasty and filling. My husband enjoyed his pulled pork sliders very much as well.   I'm not sure how tasty their healthy food is (although the salads did sound damn good on the menu!), but their bar food is great - a nice change from the offerings at your typical PT's.~burger bacon pulled pork ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~04sgkOZVexEwBP9TniY1NQ~*****2013 Entertainment book...$10 bucks off of your bill of $30 or more*****   Well it has been about two years since I was here last for a less than memorable dining experience. You know those times you have dined at an establishment and had great food then you boast to a friend on how good it was. Then you take that friend to eat there and it is a complete disaster and not good at all! Well that is what happened here about two years ago so that is why I have stayed away for so long.  This just goes to show that an establishment can change for the better or worse after time, in this case luckily was for the good! I know my fellow Yelper and good friend Karen is going to shake her head and laugh when she reads this review! lol You can also read her review from when she posted about our crappy horrific visit as well.  This was one of those nights where you want to dine out however can't decide on a place so this is where hubby and I ended up.  We got there late however the basketball game was still playing so our server invited us to take advantage of happy hour as she would honor it for us. So I got a whiskey and coke for $2 and my sweetie decided on a Dog's Draft choice beer for $2 to start our meal off!  Their special this Tuesday night 3-10pm only was a half slab of BBQ baby back ribs, coleslaw and fries for $9.95. I must admit this meal was finger licking good with the fall off of the bone rib meat. The coleslaw was sweet and delicious as well really complimenting this meal along with the great golden fries. It is a lot of food for the price making a great special that I would order again for sure!  My hubby decided on the Brewer's Sandwich, a johnsonville beer brat and a red Klement's smoked brat topped with grilled onions, sauerkraut & Swiss cheese on grilled rye with beer mustard. Served with garlic fries. His meal looked delicious and he really enjoyed it a lot!  We decided for dessert to share their Big Dog's Brownie Sundae a warm, gooey, homemade chocolate brownie, topped with  häagen dazs vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chopped peanuts. drizzled with hot fudge. It was very good!  The service was good as our server was friendly and attentive with a smiling face which made us feel comfortable.  I am happy to say the food we ordered on this visit was 100% better in quality, taste, portion and price then it was on the last visit!  We also took advantage of our coupon $10 off your check of $30 or more, so basically my $9.95 baby back rib dinner was free!~coke ribs, coleslaw fries coleslaw fries. sandwich, swiss cheese ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~6jO5jz678M64-ve_JCS_Aw~Nasty, terrible and disgusting come to mind as I walked in this place with a seat yourself sign.  Even worse they told me with kids I could not sit in the main dining area and I must sit in a narrow hall way that was truly awful.  It was also smokey and loud in here.  We immediately left and went to the Steak House at Circus Circus that provides incredible service, food and atmosphere.  If you want a quality place to dine and have kids avoid Big Dog's Cafe, I guess the name should have been a clue.~steak ~1
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~Bv1rfbs2KRO_AI19k5AecA~+ Nachos that fill up an entire plate.  + Fresh salads and soups.  + Great microbrewed Beer.  + Video poker at the bar  + Tv's throughout the entire place.  + Friendly bartenders.   - The only negative is when you sit at the bar and the old dude next to you lights up, and leaves a burning cig in the ashtray!  Would you please smoke it or put it out?!?  We have had to change seats because of this before.  (Man do I miss the Holy Cow!  Yeah, I know, it's been closed forever, but you never get over your first Vegas love.)~nachos salads ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~9GuYA7IbeKCv_owWv4rHeg~I'm not usually one to frequent sports bars... but I'll make an exception for wonderful Big Dog's!  They make their own beer, something that I've found to be pretty rare here in Vegas.  While most bars are offering you a choice of Bud, Bud Light or Coors, Big Dog's offers those PLUS about 8 of their awesome microbrews!  If you're a beer lover, you gotta try their IPA!  It's simply heavenly!  They usually have their regular IPA but once in a while they also offer War Dog, a knock-you-on-your-ass 9% alcohol imperial IPA!  It is SO GOOD but beware, as you really only need to drink one.  I would also recommend the stout and pale ale.  Skip the bizarre wheat beer... it tastes like root beer to me for some weird reason.    Atmosphere in the place is pretty good for a sports bar with video poker machines.  The staff is friendly and they remember you.  Very high ceilings and good ventilation, so you won't come out smelling like smoke.  They also have good bar food- excellent fries, and I would highly reccommend the fish tacos.  Nachos are HUGE... share with 10 people!~wheat fries, tacos. nachos ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~A4N3ZAzitKZQKsJx-LKxDg~I've got to hand it to Big Dogs. My family has been coming to this place for years.  Big Dogs is basically a PTs with microbrews with a cafe attached. You walk into the big Dog House. The bar area is 21 plus, it's smokey, and there are various video poker machines. The restaurant is on the left half of the building. There is a section of hi-top seating which allows seating; the larger dining area is lined with booths and scattered tables.   I've never had a bad meal here, ever. Even those that I didn't like that much were based on my own taste buds (I just don't like brats, never will). They offer up amazing soups and cheese curds. If you are feeling indulgent, order some of these bad boys. They are gooey cheesy, beer-battered perfection. Seriously, my mouth is watering as I type this.  Some of my go-to regulars are the Southwest Steak salad, the pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips, and grandma's pot roast. They offer fries, coleslaw, potato salad, or sweet potato fries.   Service is always prompt and friendly. The place doesn't feel overly clean, but I think that has to do with the indoor smoking and dim lighting.    Big Dog is Top Dog, too!~cheese steak salad, pulled pork ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~PvDdM4qoubKcwwsOJz8Eyg~i've been here many times and the food is always on point. a lot of these "bar food" places are just soggy, greasy and overpriced but i'm never disappointed here. their beers are not far from excellent also. the sweet potato waffle fries are super good if you're tired of eating plain old french fries all the time. i highly recommend stopping by for lunch if you're ever in the area.~sweet potato ~4
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~WONkI0cJMEO28LikU33-GQ~Next stop on the Vegas slider pilgrimage - BIG Dogs.  Haven't been here in ages - kinda avoided / boycotted  since they were a big competitor of mine back in the bar owning days.  well, that was then, sliders are more important !!  debated about the tenderloin sliders or the angus since i wanted to focus on the burger options when they are offered, i chose the angus.  The angus sliders with cheese and fries ( $8.50 ) with a diet coke - i was being a good boy yet not sure why !  on a side note - this place needs a good cleaning and it really needs some fresh air pumped in ! the sliders - decent, nice spicing in the meat -something i didn't experience at the other spots.   fries - ehhhhh.  i hit them for $100 on the machines so i treated myself to an ice cream at danielles next door ( separate review )~burger cheese fries ( coke - fries - ice cream ~3
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~RIA4N2L7q2Gm9QvmK25QVg~So, whenever I go to a restaurant which has Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches on the menu, that's the first thing I sample. If they do a good job with that, I am happy with the restaurant.   I was torn with this one. One part of me wanted to cradle this moist, flavorful, delicious sandwich as one would a hard-earned trophy, or a cherished heirloom. The other part of me wanted to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once, and just wallow in cheesy ecstasy. If I hadn't been heading to meeting with customers, I'd probably have ordered a second one just to rub all over myself, so that no part of me would have to miss out on this sandwich.   I recently found out that a friend of mine had their wedding catered by Big Dog's. Now I know why.~sandwiches sandwich sandwich. ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~KzeBE8IAHZlbCIzkixX7iQ~A great place to watch football. Great bloody Mary at a great price...$3.50 is unheard of in Vegas. They serve breakfast too. This is great since college football starts at 9 am.  The best is their microbrew beer.  I loved their Tailwagger Wheat and Red Hydrant Ale. Loved their prices too.  In a land where a beer on the strip costs $10 its nice to see a game day special of 20 wings and a pitcher of microbrew for $20!~wheat ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~Y_bFvaDzT1YgMLrw2jB5CQ~First of all, let's be real----for the most part you shouldn't be going in to a bar/casino with high expectations about being served "fine" cuisine.  Having said that, the food here is better than expected.  I came here more for the selection of "home-brewed" beers and was not disappointed.  Especially because on Saturday nights they offer half-price pitchers and at $8 it's a good deal even for a single diner like myself.  They had a Baby Back Ribs special with a 1/3 rack of ribs plus coleslaw and sweet potato waffle fries for $8----can't beat the price.  The meat was very tender and fell off the bone and the sauce was not overpowering (it's a sweeter sauce if you like tangy instead).  I didn't try anything else because hey, it is a bar and casino!  But I would come back to try something else and maybe even try their breakfast with a fresh glass of beer.  Now we're talking!  :)~ribs ribs coleslaw sweet potato ~3
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~3lNfoAa8yTR6Mr4DrH7EfA~I have typically stopped in to toss a few bucks into the machines when bored but have eaten here on occasion too.    First off, while it's probably not so, you just get the feeling that nothing in the place is clean.  It's old.  It shows no signs of renovation and thus the feeling of 25 years  (just a guess) of being open twenty-four hours a day catches up with the place.  As I have seen in other reviews, the smoke hanging in the air doesn't jibe well with an eating establishment.  I had it at 3 stars, but writing the review, I just can't give 3 (A ok) to a place where my clothes stink like smoke every time I spend an hour there.  Food positive:  Only place I know you can get a Bratzel (brat/burger combo on a pretzel bun)!  Food negative:  This place sort of touts itself as a Packer (ie Wisconsin) establishment but the cheese curds are terrible and covered in some sort of Parmesan cheese or something - gross - that's not how you serve cheese curds.  Oh...and as a "sports" bar, shouldn't you have the Big 10 network??  They don't.~cheese cheese cheese ~2
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~091i-SGD07q3eTwLoT2TxQ~The Black Lab Stout is AWESOME! I like to pair it with the Black and Bleu Burger (with mushrooms added). The vibe here is always chill, the staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and the food is great. I would gladly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to eat away from the craziness of The Strip.~burger ( mushrooms ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~hVoWZzLLfWxzAk2lMDrkCA~To continue....  Great lunch specials, had a tri-tip samich with caramelized red onions on ciabatta roll.... A - mazing !  The fish samich is the catch of the sea with 2 large deep fried filets on a wheat bun...ohhh soooo good!!  Can't go wrong with da Big Dog salad with the chipotle ranch dressing....yummmmmm!    and of course the in house brews.... .38 special? just sounds coool or tailwagger wheat? why sure, please....may I have some more?  Red Hydrant Ale... well you know....  and the typical array of TV's and video poker machines, I like the blackjack.....  LET IT RIDE!!!!!~ciabatta wheat salad ranch dressing.... wheat? ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~Cwni4rRss1DVmDZU4I3fhQ~we had the best meal in a long time here last night! Excellent fast service! we waited less than 10 minutes for our food, the food was AMAZING! steak was so delicious, garlic fries were sooooo gooood! and the brownie dessert was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. (sigh) I think im in love... :D~steak garlic fries ~5
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~LBwx2BtAN5ciSLIuZ0HHng~Eh / Meh / Uhh (or as yelp says, "Meh. I've experienced better.")  Good service, decent food but really dark and somewhat spooky in the lack of windows and insane amount of cigarette smoke.  I recommend a sandwich or fried chicken-type dish, don't try the salads. Trust me. And don't expect a great selection of craft beers, but the prices are fair and like I said, the service has always been good to great there.~sandwich fried chicken ~2
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~uoo7pR86JYX02AlQvJ4RTg~For the past two Sundays, I've come here to hang out for a couple of hours while my Son is at a Church function.  I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.  I was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.  I watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying "Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!".....she replied "I know"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!  This is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.  Back to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.  The Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.  I took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.  Will I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.~nachos ( tea. nachos nachos! nachos nachos cheese, sour cream, nachos..... nachos cheese nachos nachos, chips ~2

1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~87wccxB2OKgdNw4PwzpmVw~Bartender was great and knew the beers very well. Food was good, had the brat/sausage burger and it really hit the spot. The whole place itself looks like it needs a deep cleaning and to change its air filters but what can u expect from a local dive bar. I will go back when i want to gorge my self on good Wisconsin styled food though.~burger ~3
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~OfHWw4OqwqzyQf5FdkU41Q~Just ok. The cheese curds are delicious. The beer is just average. The pretzel is  not a pretzel, it's bread with salt on it, shaped like a pretzel.~cheese ~2
1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q~CFZWr6Wro5hBIoxK8zWWkQ~Good football specials and strong drinks. That about sums up this place. We had wings and drinks while watching the games last Sunday. They don't have every game up and you can't really see all the games from just one seat, but it's still a good place to grab some beer and enjoy some cheap bar food. The spicy honey wings won me over and they have really good beers they brew themselves on special. The Patron margarita put me over the top. It was strong and really good. Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.~honey ~4
3Phhm4suJ-9fVakKXJSMxg~EiiK6ayw26wEOb3bF8scqw~Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of "Food Central".  It has the same concept as Yorkdale and Eaton Centre, as they give you real cutlery and dishes as opposed to the plastic ones.    Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller, but there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc.).  Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall, but not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)  Also, compared to Yorkdale, there's no special sit down restaurants close to the food court besides Earl's.~burger, ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~asHvvC1mUN_hweRw8DeRkA~The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive--an ideal balance. The friend I met for dinner here had been here many times before and usually ordered the meat dinner for two. We decided to try the vegetarian version this time.   Delicious! The dhal was fabulous, as was the saag paneer. Fresh naan and thick, not too sweet lassi. The kheer was similar--rich, but not overly sweet.  In all, a delicious meal! We lucked out in being seated without a reservation, but the waiter seemed a little nonplussed at first, and we had an option of one of two tables, as all of the rest of them were reserved. So--probably best to call ahead if you're planning on coming for dinner.  My one regret is that the dinner special was so enticing--and delicious, and filling--that I never got a chance to try the other tempting options on the menu!~paneer. lassi. kheer ~4

0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~TcRW-Sg7AvyN6RY_nNY9IA~so disappointed !  i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...  first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a "fine-dining" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .  the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared "fresh" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .  the naan was okay .  if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .  no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?~cauliflower potatoes . butter chicken butter ~2
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~zkxUfTgcP4Vr4dYqPU9Psg~Good quick service and all of the chicken dishes were fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone in the area. I'm looking forward to going back.~chicken ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~N2o-HfsL5EwvDPIG-bqVYw~This place converted me to malai kofta, but the butter chicken is the piece de resistance. Come for lunch for a $10 buffet and enjoy an endless supply of their amazing rice pudding and naan, but be warned that the lunch butter chicken has lots of bones while the dinner a la carte butter chicken is made with boneless chicken breast.~butter chicken rice pudding butter chicken butter chicken chicken ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~w9hvRJnb-02MGzsb9kPJMw~Dinner; Jan 15, 2011  Enjoyed a great meal with friends. The place was crowded and we waited 10 minutes (around 8 pm) My partner enjoyed the Chicken vindaloo.... way too spicy for me, but tasty... the butter chicken was one of the best I have had and the lamb saag was perfectly balanced. Don't bother with the appetizers, just order extra naan or other type of bread. Prices are decent the service impeccable.~chicken butter chicken lamb appetizers, ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~nLzCF_n2q1r1b-dwAA1Tjg~delicious well-priced food with an awesome location on bloor street  shared several with five people, had  saag lamb- amazing, very tender and perfectly cooked lamb  chicken jalfrezi- excellent level of spice  vegetable tandoori- great dish for sharing, comes steaming hot with a huge variety of vegetables and paneer, my fav things to order here  shrimp jalfrezi- just as good at the chicken jalfrezi bhuteko cali- traditional vegetable dish from nepal, very well seasoned, reminded me of my travels in the Kathmandu Valley!  yes service is slow but I have been to Nepal and service is WAY slower (they make everything from scratch and multiple orders means long waits) in that country so it's a very traditional laid back dining atmosphere~lamb chicken paneer, shrimp chicken ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~HdnyPPt_tIfQ92bGIgi-uQ~This place is wonderful. The flavours are rich and vibrant, with all the spices and herbs tingling every taste bud. Everything is reasonably priced so there's no fear of feasting on wanky food for two hours only to have to go to Pizza Pizza afterwards.~pizza pizza ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~T8cIwho_AsV9asBQ6twxAA~Everest is probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The service is great, the decor is contemporary and the food is superb.  I highly recommend the Aloo Tama Bodi, Chicken Momos, the Lamb Vindaloo, Panir Tikka and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Some of the best dining service I've had and the food is unique and of high quality.~chicken lamb vindaloo, chicken ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~Haz0jZhlqsBa7eJGpqgW9Q~Amazing Indian Food. ordered the vegetarian meal for two and was very impressed with everything-- the vegetables were delicious, the saag paneer is the best I have ever tasted and the Naan is so fresh and tasty. Great service + great food= happy customer.~paneer ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~x1obKjzO51uFLu0T95yG1w~Went here for dinner on a weekday and the live music was great, makes the experience much more enjoyable.  The service was good and not too over-the-top.  We loved the curry chicken, the garlic naan was good too, but I prefer regular naan.  Their spicy shrimp was very flavourful.  The quality of the dishes was very high.  The portions are much smaller than what I am used to at other Indian places though and it's a bit pricey too.  Overall, it was great though, I'd come back.~chicken, garlic shrimp ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~0cx1nqLS0KUv0vGK6GNp7w~The food was delicious. I had a vegetarian homemade cottage cheese + creamy tomato mix.. i forgot the name of the dish, but regardless it was fantastic. My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken, which was extremely tender and juicy. Overall, one of the best Indian I had in Toronto..   One down side is that in comparison to the ambiance and portions, the price was a bit too expensive. Our dinner was one order of each rice, naan, the chicken, and the tomato... tax + tip was a total of $40. Not cheap at all.  I'd probably go again but I wish it was a bit cheaper. ( The vegetarian dish was $12 before tax ! Which is normally the price of a  chicken someplace else)  Service was good, the food came out pretty quickly.  Good dinner overall!!~cottage cheese ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~k9Th_Y14GNvDamuR5z8VEQ~I've been to Mt Everest countless times over the years for their cheap buffet lunch (believe it costs $10.99 now but back in the day it was only $8.99)  Tried out dinner here last week for the first time.   I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.  My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.  Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.  Service was bothersome for me - very spotty at this place. At times they were over topping off water every 5 minutes, and at other times we could not flag them down to get extra rice or the bill, etc.  Lunch buffet is still a great option!~date tandoori chicken ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~-fOJsLzrqrHAnET684bDSw~Ok, everyone else who has commented here needs to calm down a little bit.  Yes, this restaurant is nice, but come on...5 stars?  I split a non-vegetarian combo for 2 with my girlfriend and it was delicious.  In particular, the chicken from the tandoor was uncharacteristically juicy.  Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.  The ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.  There was just something about that scenario that screamed "We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?  We have a sitar, Indian food, an inexpensive lunchtime buffet and waiters wearing bowties."  Don't get me wrong, I'd come back here in a second, especially to order more stuff from the tandoor or the delicious mataar paneer, but it is NOT a 5 star restaurant.~chicken chicken white paneer, ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~dvjLutu4zJHIhLsY-uZ3Fg~What a very nice place at Bloor Street west . You can have a nice buffet with a great selection of Indian food or you can order from the menu. I recommend the garlic naan and the mango lassi.~garlic mango lassi. ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~Wmf3AHzNBp3rXMLkc1M1UA~The restaurant sits on the south side of Bloor Street with glass windows looking out onto the street. Like most Toronto restaurants it is long and narrow. There is a bar when you enter that separates a section of tables at the front and some near the kitchen. The decor is dark and rich with lots of wood accents. When we arrived it was almost empty but while we were sitting it was full in no time. The staff was attentive and polite providing service when needed. The menu featured a selection of expected East-Indian and Nepalese dishes. We opted for some onion bhajis, a roti, a garlic naan, and two vindaloos. Although the bhajis were a little greasy and too salt everything else was delicious. It was what one would expect for a place frequented by locals from the neighbourhood.~onion garlic ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~ScQT7HQvN2KfDHORKogAzA~My favorite Indian/Nepalese place in Toronto. I love the vegetarian combo, and the Chana Masala, and the Aloo Gobi...and so much more about this place. The servers are all extremely kind and friendly. If you order a complicated dish, it may take more time to come out of the kitchen--but at least you know they are cooking it with care and not throwing it in the microwave.~chana masala, ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~qDc4CCh1b6NJrFM81fe0eg~Great neighborhood Indian joint.  Can't beat the takeout student special - 2 (smaller size) dishes, rice, naan/roti, salad, raita, and a beverage for $10.99 (veg) or $11.99 (non-veg or combo).~salad, ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~cYXtz8-WFJISI7jKAtA7YA~It's a pleasant atmosphere to dine in. I liked the paintings of Nepal on the walls as well as the post cards near the door. They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them.   The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.  We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.  The service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.  Dinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax. Pretty expensive for a very middling experience.  I'd have liked them to put more effort in their food than their decor.~potatoes, lentils bamboo shoots) bamboo shoots ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~TUu8hYDM8b46WInkctNWWA~While the service was very good and the decor was passable, the food at Mt. Everest left a lot to be desired.  While the lunch buffet only cost $9.99, the food was very, very average. There were two meat dished, a few vegetarian dishes, and a small salad bar, so there was some variety, but the quality left a lot to be desired. The meat dishes were dry and cooked carelessly - the pieces of chicken looked like they'd been hacked at - and the veggies at the salad bar were dry and looked rather waxy. The only good dishes were the vegetarian ones, and while they tasted okay, it didn't feel like much care had been taken in their preparation.  Dinner, while much better, also came with a much steeper price tag. An order of tikka masala, rice, and naan set me back $16, and the portions of tikka masala and rice were truly very small for the price tag.~salad chicken salad ~2
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~_B49HDJ8DirgEegyslLbdA~I can't remember the name of my dish but it was a Northern Indian specialty with ginger and a blend of unique spices. It was one of the best meals I ever had.  The place is nice and quiet and the servers were friendly and efficient.  I hope my  fiancée's friends from Toronto get married so we can eat at this restaurant again~ginger ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~ePQ6a3dUqGzlsNSoPC-4PA~Whether you want to get the $10 lunch buffet (such a good deal) or a night with a fine dining atmosphere without the fine dining price tag, this is for you.  Their food is excellent, really - especially during dinner time. Service is impeccable (they seriously make you feel like you're at a restaurant that would charge double the price) and prices are very reasonable.  The food at the lunch buffet is most likely just extra leftovers from the previous night so the tandoori chicken won't be as juicy and the naan not as fluffy/warm, but the curry is just as good. Either way, you can't get a better deal for $10.  Try the Lamb Vindaloo (very spicy) or the Chicken Korma!~tandoori chicken ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~CBLO3bmdnwRpblapypLGHw~My wife and son and i chose Mt everest based on our location on bloor west and yelp reviews.  The decor is clean and pleasant and we were greeted as soon as we came in.  After our orders were taken, it took quite a while for our food to arrive and we were starting to get jittery.  It was early for dinner, 4 45 , but it was not clear why it took over 35 minutes.  All i can say is that the wait was worthwhile, the food was very good.  Tandoori veggies, lamb tikka, hunters platter, chicken masala, everything was hot and tasty, spiced just right.  The sauce and yoghurt marinade were balanced and just right.  What we appreciated the most was the quality of the lamb and other meats.  They do not cut corners on quality. A satisfying dinner.~lamb chicken lamb ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~ctCPvXHU-DFgTepXgrWJOA~I'll admit, I've never actually sat down at Mt Everest. One time a friend popped over with some leftovers that were so good I didn't know what to do with myself, but after ordering takeout, I am not impressed.  Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.  I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach.~okra garlic garlic ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~qRVNpk1rwKY_0mfLaPIJOQ~Me and my friend wanted to dine on some Indian food over a movie. I had previously gone to Mt. Everest for the lunch buffet and found it decent enough to order delivery.   I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants.   The food:  1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto.   3 out 5 stars.  2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad.   0 out 5 stars.  We had to throw out the naan and ate the butter chicken with bread. Totally ruined the evening for us.~butter chicken, butter chicken: chicken butter chicken butter chicken butter chicken ~1
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~wKj9l-sBgwt0uBAPzjoSXA~I am a self-confessed foodie, and so I'll explain why this much looked-forward-to event turned into the worst nightmare. This restaurant has the most horrible customer service that you can imagine. Me and a friend went over in the early part of the evening and resto was already pretty crowded. One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!' OK..another 15 went by..my friend went again to look for the sever who (guess what) took one look at him and ran inside!! Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated. We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus. I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly. We left the resto hungry, tired and with a resolve to tell other foodies like us about how LITTLE THEY CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER!! Oh and btw- you get seated first if you're white! :-( epic, epic fail.~white! ~1
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~Dr63Xhc5dLQDQNEBxeIrCQ~Went here with a Nepalese friend of mine. Delicious Naan bread and whatever else we had was good too. My friend ordered in Nepalese so I have no idea what the dishes were, but they were sufficiently spicy and easily mopped up with the bread, which was hot and freshly made.   I think one of the appetizers was called Momo, it reminded me of dim sum but much spicier. Here is a picture from a google search. http://www.travelandtournepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Momo-With-Sauce.jpg  Highly recommend the momo. I would go here again on my next visit to Toronto. Price was reasonable.~appetizers ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~taX6n4fUU1CtU8OMsulCGA~this is a nice spacious restaurant with low lighting and simple but nice decor, nothing all that memorable, but clean nonetheless.  we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.  then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.  the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.  the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.  all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece.  id like to come back here again, but id focus specifically on the nepalese dishes.~chicken chicken spinach soup chicken, beef lamb, chicken lamb lamb paneer, ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~hcXIYytHJQFIA0dyJx1NnQ~The food is undoubtedly very, very good and perhaps the best Indian food I've had in Toronto so far. No complaints there. But it is overpriced. The restaurant itself is quite large.   I must comment that I disliked the service. One of the waiters was particularly rude, which comes as no surprise since Indians lack any semblance of tact (being Indian, I'm allowed to say that).   Ordered the Fish Pakora, and Shrimp Masala with Naan. It took about 30-40 minutes for my entree to arrive, and what's worse, is they got my order wrong. After they did so however, one of the servers questioned whether I had indeed ordered that. On the other hand, they did rectify the order immediately, and apologized for the mixup Everything I ordered was delicious. I recommend getting the Shrimp Masala. I would return here.~shrimp shrimp ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~z-oDrEJPhsemNvOjvbikvQ~Wow, um wow wow wow! I have lived near this restaurant for 6 years and never bothered to go in..why, I have no idea..it's a mystery.  Tonight, my husband and I ventured in, wanting to try something new out and let me just say, words cannot express how utterly delicious tasting the food is here!!  We selected the dinner for two and had plenty to eat, in fact, we overate, ensuring that there were no left overs.  We ended our meal with AMAZING mango juice...I'm so stuffed, I almost feel ill but it was well worth it.    The restaurant is moving elsewhere in the neighbourhood.  Wherever it ends up, I shall follow!!~mango ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~uPUfPIlS9SdJ5YK-er7Fcw~I have tried a ton of Indian food but never had the pleasure to Nepalese so I was instantly excited to try out this place.  The decor was nice and understated. Waiters were super attendant and polite!  So off to a good start.  What we ordered: Momos Jhane ko dal Aloo tama bodi Lamb Briyani Raita  When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.  The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be "cooked" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).  Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.  I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food - but it was definately fantastic and I will be back again (and again and again).~dal lamb briyani lamb potato peas ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~grfDM51bIXv2Ghj6xY24pA~The buffet is great, hard to go wrong with that.  From the menu, my favourite item is the tandoori lamb skewers.   Very flavourful, a lovely hint of onions and spices.  Staff have been reasonably friendly.~lamb ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~6mPY26RM6cKCK6VX11wIWw~This place was good, but not great.   I order the chicken vindaloo, because I wanted something pretty spicy! The waiter warned us the dish was very spicy, but we said that is great -- just what we are looking for. However, the dish wasn't very spicy at all, I was disappointed.......  The palak paneer was strange, shreds of spanish instead of puree.   The chicken hariyali on the other hand was excellent -- best dish out of the night!  Would not return though, better indian places to go to.~chicken paneer chicken ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~cYSafV47Y7mXsFlj_guGjg~Wow. The dinner is infinitely better than the lunch buffet. My friend and I split the meat bhojan for two. (Delicious and far better than Roti Cuisine - though rotis shouldn't really be compared with real restaurant style food).  We added a bottle of wine and stuffed ourselves silly. The tandoori chicken hit all the right notes - I could taste the hint of lime from the marinade. Perfection. The bill wasn't bad. The meat bhojan was 38, the wine was probably another $30 - 40, and somehow our total was just over a hundred.~tandoori chicken ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~vQwpCakE4NAjJ6BDNHmzFw~We went here for dinner after work.   Ambience-Liked the music in the background. It was relaxing and wasn't loud and annoying like some other restaurants I've been to.  Service-The service was attentive and friendly. It does take them some time to bring you the food so it's good to keep that in mind if you're really hungry.  Food. We ordered the following: Naan bread Butter Chicken Chicken Tandoori-nice and hot as it was served on a sizzling hot place. Some parts got charred. Basmatic rice Lamb Gosht recommended by the host-I found a lot of the pieces to be dried. Perhaps the leg of lamb would have been better.  Verdict. I liked the butter chicken and chicken tandoori. I didn't try the naan but my dinner companions raved about it.  I did find it expensive for the three of us as there was nothing to spectacular about this place. I would probably skip this place in the future and go to Little India for lunch buffet instead.~butter chicken chicken lamb lamb butter chicken chicken ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~tsKt2tIL20rYmtgMWmTEBA~I've been to Mt Everest twice and I left quite happy both times. The service is excellent and the flavours memorable. I went with three other people and ordered the typical butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a vegetarian dish with spinach, i forget the name. Normally, after eating Indian cuisine, I am usually ready for a nap. After eating here, I still felt quite alive...yet satisfied. There didn't appear to be a layer of oil on the top which I find with some other places. This, I know makes some of the flavour but at Mt Everest, it still tasted fantastic. Medium was the right amount of spice...a bit of a kick but not overwhelming.  Also like most Indian places, it is always good to get a few different items and share. I will definitely be back soon.~butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic spinach, ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~w9Ret5Lp6i6l1EIJPuQMFw~I had lived at Bloor and Spadina for many years and never tried the place, but finally got to last week... I absolutely love this place now. Like, seriously best Indian food ever!  The server was AWESOME. My girlfriend had never eaten indian food in her life and she was quite scared of the "spicy". I had made it my mission that the first Indian restaurant she tried would have to be the best if I wanted to make a convert of her- and I was only going to get one chance at it... thankfully the server picked up on that and made some suggestions and was very kind explaining to her the signature dishes there. We got the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikki Masala (the server said the chef LOVES to make the Tiki Masala) and shared the rice and naan. While the Butter Chicken was good, the Tikki Masala really did take the cake as just incredible.  Definitely going to go back there and try the buffet and very excited to know I'm in the delivery area.  Highly recommend this place! Didn't get to see the Sitar player on this trip, but would certainly be a great bonus to go on the night's they're playing there!~butter chicken chicken butter chicken cake ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~Wge889BxUN_CukQGZWdEkw~After realizing Nepalese food is kind of like Indian food, but healthier, I was all in. Headed down for a date dinner before a show at the Bloor Theatre. I called ahead, but was told no reservation necessary, but by the end of the night all the good tables were full.  The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.   I wanted to try the Nepalese specialties only. So, we ordered 2 naan and 2 dishes- the daal-like dish and the spinach dish. This was way more food than we could have eaten! But, considering we were headed to the theatre, didn't take any leftovers anyway.  But, price wise, the dinner for 2 is an amazing deal. If I ever go back, which is likely given our monthly Doc Soup at the Bloor, I'll go for that. As others  have said, the vegetarian dinner for 2 includes a beer per person, dessert, naan, rice, and 3 dishes!  One highlight of the night was the Paneer Naan we picked out. It was like ghee-covered Inidan Pizza! Fresh out of the Tandoori oven, I could have finished off 3 of those alone!~date spinach soup paneer pizza ~3
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~6kaglwk_c87YDcdKuZ9gPQ~With the temperature reaching a seasonal low -25 last week, we decided it wisest to order lunch to the office. I combed the online delivery options available and developed a taste for Indian food. I thought a little spice would warm me up - I was starting to feel like Michael Keaton in the unanimously critically acclaimed film, Jack Frost (imdb rating: 5.0).  Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:  1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices) 2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)  The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.  Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.  Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed.   Flavour-wise, I actually would recommend. However, it's likely that in-restaurant portions would be more significant and provide better value, so I wouldn't advise getting takeout.~garlic potatoes, bamboo shoots, black beans cottage cheese ~2
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~gKBu2LHCtbPzlUvIyj24zw~I always love the food here.  The lunch buffet is the best, but dinner here is great too, clearly a little pricier though.  Even so, I go back to this place all the time when I am in the neighborhood.  I went again last night with some friends.  Only one friend was disappointed, he ordered the tandoori fish, he said it wasn't very tandoori and the portion was small.  (But it looked the best, arriving on a sizzling plate)  He was lamenting all of this after the meal.  Everyone else was well satisfied though.  One had the lamb and as another friend of mine did years ago, they both loved it.  One tried the first chicken option on the menu and he loved it too.  I had the okra dish, it was so tasty.   The service was fast, polite and efficient.~lamb chicken okra ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~OHQu1vhzCu_sr7vorsJIow~We waited for-ever.  Accompanied by a Nepalese friend we were here to try the Nepalese section of a mostly Indian focused menu.    The Choyela chicken appetizer was fantastic; nice to try a different spice flavor than the usual Indian spices we're now accustomed to.  Khasi Ko Maasu goat was the Nepalese non-vegetarian entree I went with.  The menu de-emphasizes meat and lists it second; how dare they.~chicken ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~BNnYDdVMPHwHL80r4DfikA~With as imposing a name as Mount Everest, you might think that this Nepalese restaurant would be a place of epic food proportions. But instead of table-sagging selections of meat, rice, and heavy sauce, we left here after dining feeling full but not overwhelmed by the experience. It's a good place to come for creative and well-crafted North Indian food that will not leave a mark or make too heavy of an impression.    The dishes we ordered included a delicious portion of Aloo Tama Bodi ("Potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black-eyed beans cooked with mountain spices.") and a vegetarian tasting menu for two. The naan was excellent, as other reviewers have mentioned. The service was efficient, friendly, and elegant. The wine was an Argentinian Pinot Noir from Patagonia, pleasantly different from the norm. It fit well the food that was familiar but with a slight variation in presentation, spice, and flavor that made things interesting without being too intense.  I kind of liked the balance here. Nothing was overdone. Everything was savory and satisfying. It made for a very pleasant meal. And that's something to celebrate.~potatoes, bamboo shoots, ~4
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~v1_qYTP41GCqzDHLBMSqwg~This is an incredible restaurant for a delicious date.  The vibrant and subtle sauces, spices and flavors take you on a journey beyond the senses.  Especially if you're a student who eats elsewhere normally, the dinner for two special at about $30 is remarkably filling and memorable.  High rating but it is not an expensive place for power suits or celebrities - although you can feel like one if you dress like it.~date. ~5
0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w~Oh7FuSwfyK0KnFSGu5YCSQ~Went to this place with my wife last Friday based on all the positive reviews that I read on Yelp. I have to agree with most Yelpers, this is definitely a gem of a place.  My wife had the Matar Paneer and I had one of the chicken dishes. Both of them were  very delicious and well prepared.  I'm only giving this place a 4 because we had to wait a few extra minutes for the waiter to get our orders. Otherwise I would have given this place a solid 5.~paneer chicken ~4
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~KU5byMSen-s5Uq6GNajE6w~I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.  Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.  When I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash!~carne burrito chips salsa burrito ~4
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~2prUfByEIa7iBr5wtPMYOQ~This is a locally owned mexican restaurant that definitely has some good dishes and salsa.  However in these times I think that you need to excell on each level.  A restaurant can't rely soley on the food.  Located on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying "Please seat yourself."    So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.  I could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.  I'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout.~salsa. bell ~3
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~AYwtdNJNAZvpM6kxqJeMxw~Maria was super nice and inviting. 5 stars for service and ambiance. This place was clean. The rest room was clean.   The chips and salsa were excellent, hot and chunky salsa.   Food: I had the two soft taco meal with rice and beans. I mixed the tacos one with Chicken and one with Beef. The beef was carne asada on two small corn shells. Topped with pico. The chicken was chopped into cubes and was "day old" at best. It was not fresh. Topped with pico.  The rice was good but I have had better, the beans were ok but really lacked flavor.   The "lunch" was about 10 bucks and I felt cheated. Maybe I am not a Jalisco style fan?~chips salsa salsa. taco tacos chicken beef. beef carne asada corn chicken ~3
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~tpGFUZc2tkRi1NQZ4t6AaA~Yes, sometimes the service can be slow. If you are in a hurry, I'm sure that there is a taco shop somewhere close to you. If you are looking for THE BEST Mexican Food restaurant in Phoenix, El Conquistador is it. I cannot recommend this place enough to everyone I know. The old location used to be close to my house, but we still drive 15 miles out of our way to come here every week. The food is consistently outstanding. My favorite is the enchiladas verdes con pollo. Delicious!!!~taco ~5
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~MqmopvbhgZNu-TbWTIDiYA~The only reason that I can even begin to imagine as to why reviewers say it's nothing special is because a) they were expecting the typical Mexican food. This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.  Ambiance: It's a CUTE restaurant with an old town Mexican theme. Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring.  Service: You are evil spawn if you don't like M&M. They work hard and are the loveliest people ever! They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough. He looks angry but I swear he's super nice. She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in.Thanks.  Food (and none of it is greasy!): + Pork chop/cube with green sauce: INCREDIBLE. OMYGOODNESS. They're soft. They're savory. They're moist. They couldn't be better. They make me want to sing my praises from the rooftops of Phoenix. + Chicken tacos: Skip them. They are kind of disappointing. + Chicken tortilla soup: AMAZING. Seriously. I have yet to find one that's better. It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses! Mmm. + Refried beans: Fantastic. The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food. If anyone knows beans, it's me. + Chips and salsa: The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy. The salsa is great. One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot. Both taste amazing.  And the best of all: their always-spotless utensils, plates, and tables make me endlessly happy. So clean :')~chicken tacos. pork chicken tacos: chicken soup: chips salsa: chips salsa ~5
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~TFh6oec79dZLPYgUqoK-ug~Had to stop by Big5 for a sleeping bag and saw El Conquistador on the way out of the parking lot. Figured I'd stop in and have a quick bite and be on my way.   When I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty.   We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our "quick" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes.   I had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu.   The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid.   From the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't. I doubt it.~salsa. chips salsa chips salsa. chips salsa. salsa chips. burrito. steak burrito. cheese enchilada cheese. chips salsa ~1
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~FSGD2vwJS2-t75zuKXrqOw~I'm giving El Conquistador 4 stars for the food but 1.5 stars for the service. I wanted to LOVE this place, I really did -- I know that it is a mom and pop place, and it has a fantastic review already on Yelp and in the AZ Republic. I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new "my place."   Perhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that "we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice." We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving "the eye" or "the nod" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal.   On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well.   I will definitely visit again, but if the service isn't any better then maybe I'll turn it into my new special "my takeout place."~taco enchilada -- ~3
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~y0Zc58IvORbAe-VNbrUNcw~The food is great.  The green chile is my favorite (spicy).  The el conquistador tacos are very good too.  I hear that the Chile Relleno is awesome also.   I normally don't like mexican food rice however this is the best I've had.  The beans are just OK (nobody beat Rito's beans).  The service is spotty depending on who it is.  Mark normally serves and is a little tight with the chips! (Even though u pay after the first bowl).  Maria, on the other hand, is a fantastic server and quick.  The prices are a bit steep for a family style mexican food restaurant.  I've left there sometimes wondering how the bill was so high.  But the food makes up for it and my family goes there at least once a month!~tacos chips! ~4
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~36sONrBJ8lFV6fDbxpC9iQ~So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just "Maria's" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.html  P.S. Closed Monday's~white cheese ~5
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~YnUU9dba6GcuARaszvjbVA~Food was good, but $24 for lunch is a bit steep.  One burrito al a carte and a lunch special plus a beer and a soda..    Service was great.  I'll go back and try something else around dinner time..~burrito ~3
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~tQSUomjrKZ0XSRBzpIL-Pw~What a lot of people don't understand about El Conquistador is that it is on par with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. You do not go there for ultra-friendly and speedy service, you simply be happy that you are seated at a table about to eat some of the best mexican food in the world...maybe second to Los Dos Molinos, but hey that's all the way down by South Mountain. Mark and Maria are wonderful people churning out some incredible food. My all time favorite is the El Conquistador burrito enchilada style. It's filled with steak picado, chile relleno and beans and smothered in yummy green sauce.~soup burrito enchilada steak ~5
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~hxQOruBii_1AZ9Yl4P_vyA~Based on the review on azcentral.com we decided to check out El Conquistador.  We we entered the restaurant it was busy but booths were open.  Once we sat down we must have waited around 15 minutes until we received a menu and ask for our drink orders.  Once we ordered it took around 35 minutes for us to receive our appetizer.  And dinner followed shortly there after.  Not once during dinner did anyone ask us how our meal was or refill our drinks.  We had to eat our entire meal without a beverage.  We tried several times to get someone's attention but were unsuccessful.  We must have waited another 20 minutes to receive our bill.    Our meal was adequate (chicken fajitas, kids quesa and a gringo combo platter).  The service was  poor and I would not go here if you are in a hurry.   Based on the reviews I expected more.  You would think after the reviews they would hire more help.    I would not go back or recommend this restaurant to friends or family.  Maybe the owners should read others reviews about service.  It might help them out in the long run.~chicken fajitas, ~1
29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A~zc8N2UWYImoJxbIWq4ha1w~I would give this place 2.5 stars but I will round up to 3.  Very conflicted feelings.  I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.  The good- -Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us "bambinos".  - I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.  The bad- - When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap. - Slightly overpriced. - Charged for extra chips and salsa. - My husband didn't like the food. - Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.  I didn't miss them when they moved across town.~chips salsa. burrito! ~3
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~4eHcfli7mBNrC3NsvPii-g~I was new to Toronto when I visited Local 4 a few months ago.  They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.  I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.  So we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.  The food was mediocre to bad.    I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.  Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.  Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.  But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to "try"), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?    We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)  In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.  Judging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad.~spaghetti pasta steak & steak chicken cordon bleu -- chicken, apricot ~2
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~UMi-zQMuaWZRYoAl5QG4Vg~I have a confession to make.  In the year leading up to my departure from Toronto, I spent FAR too many hours at this place.  I couldn't get enough of it.  In fact, I turned many of my friends on to it, and they're thankful for it.    Excellent food (the burger and falafel are two standouts), excellent beer (Black Oak Pale Ale), and friendly service.  The owners are laid-back people, and it shows in the kind of place they run.  Stop by on a Monday and enjoy their pint special.  Tell Theo that Nick says hello from California.~burger ~5
111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ~ug5w2Ui7dqZhuv-UlzTKwQ~Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.  The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.  The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!  The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.  We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.  For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.  My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.  To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.  Verdict:  The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.  The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.~pizza pasta. white breads spinach salad ( egg, cherry onion cheese. salad sweet potato ~3
111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ~_Md65BoCvQq7yY6qIpYnEA~Came for dinner, $70 coupon clutched in hand. One server--the owner--coping with a growing crowd and doing very well. House wine is cheap and good, appetizers (warm funghi salad) excellent, but my steak frites was way overdone and piled atop what looked like frozen fries. My wife's pasta ($17) was, she said, very good. Our shared dessert--a lime tart--was excellent. So overall, pretty good.~appetizers ( salad) steak fries. pasta ( lime ~3
111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ~-WnrdevYaXBo67aPUrw6IA~What a gem!!  My husband and I LOVE Pallucci.  If you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5+!  He knows his stuff, is happy to recommend, and sets a great pace for your meal.    Ambiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud.    Food is excellent!  So much to recommend.  The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must.  The funghi salad is sooooo good, and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini.  Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious!!  Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking.  This is a great neighborhood spot......give it a try!~sweet potato ~4
111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ~xB4_SikquAoSO2veXswSLg~3.5 stars! I went here with my gf because she had a craving for risotto and I hear this restaurant made some good ones.  We started with the caprese salad and squid salad.  They were both excellent but the squid portion was a bit small. Still tasted fantastic.  Then she had a beef and mushroom risotto which was pretty damn good.  Dessert was also fantastic, the creme brûlée inside was custardy and the top crispy as it should be.  If you want good food they have it but my only issue was the lack of people, especially on a Friday night.~risotto salad salad. beef mushroom risotto ~3
111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ~69AaPdfKwQhUFB49v6Q_cw~Small, yet cozy relaxing place.  I thought it was a bit small, so if you have a group of 8 friends gettin together for dinner, i dont think this is the best place for you.  Food was pretty good. A lil' on the pricey side- $32 for Tuna dish-a price in which the server failed to mentioned- or maybe t'was my fault not to ask, or was I even supposed to be asking for the price? err....  My friend had some meat dish for about $34.. Anyways, the service was nice- didnt have to wait 2 hrs for the foods to arrive, so that was good. Although, my tuna came out somewhat too salty, but the dinner rolls made up for it. Their thin-cut fries were amazing- reminded me of the way my grandma used to make fries for us- home fried french fries mmMMmmm   Will I go back? um---maybe. And i will be sure to order the foods w/ the prices are shown.~tuna tuna fries fries french fries ~3

My own experience was enhanced by the fact that we somehow scored seats in the front row, right under the elephant's ass when it appeared out of nowhere in front of us.  Unbelievable.  How'd they do that? You can still hang with the famous felines and even meet the duo with a trip to their Secret Garden at the Mirage Hotel.~white ~5

My issues have been regarding my orders. More often than not they forget something in my order. Once it was a 2L bottle of pop, and quite a few times it's been my dipping sauce. I currently have a credit on my pizza hut account for free dipping sauce for the next time I order. I order here about twice a month and I can understand forgetting once or twice but it seems like it's every other time now. The food does arrive hot and on time though, which is a plus.~pizza pizza pizza ~3

But this place...it was so gross. I didnt understand the menu at all. Under cold brewed coffees it just named a third world country. The staff was incredibly friendly and the sweets are delicious. Just dont go for the coffee. Its a place youd see in a weird indie film in the poetry slam night scene.~coffee coffee. ~3

Coffee is the lifeblood that fuels the dreams of champions." ― Mike Ditka, Kicking & Screaming  Waltzed into Hazelrock on Opening Weekend and I think I ruined someone's video/picture.  Oops?  I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.    The first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...  The coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.  It's a large space with lots of chairs, stools, and tables for all.   And if the drinks and pastries aren't enough to lure you in... they also sell snow.  SNOW!  "Way too much coffee.

0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~DFfgKC25hRhZbb6J6QleDA~For as much as you pay at starbucks for sub-par coffee and over processed crap, skip that place and come here!! This place is pretty amazing. I have tried several different concoctions suggested by the staff. Their cold brews and pour overs are amazing. You must try their hazelnut milk! It is infused with dates! The pastries... OMG. Delicious! The only complaint I have is that they don't have any gluten free options or breakfast/lunch foods yet.  When they do, I will be in coffee heaven. The place is pretty low key and great to study as well! You must try it out!~coffee milk! pastries... coffee ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~jswDjDjiwZTnufLJjTUi-g~After reading numerous positive reviews here, I finally decided to give Hazelrock a try. My girlfriend and I arrived in the mid afternoon on a fairly slow day. The space was nice and open - this place would do well for those looking to study. I couldn't help but notice however the modern chicness of it all, which did come across as semi-contrived. But whatever, it still gave good energy.   The menu looked interesting and expansive. There were a few choices on there I haven't seen before, such as a coconut cold brew, or a hazelnut milk latte. After some questions about the various drinks, bean sources, etc, I opted to go for the hazelnut milk latte with white chocolate added. My girl had a Brazilian hot pour coffee coffee with hazlenut milk on the side. Tempted by the tasty looking pastries, we also decided to get a peach pie. It was a pie and coffee kind of day.  We noticed immediately that there was something off about the hazelnut milk. I was expecting something silky and slightly creamy, like good almondmilk can be. What we got tasted like wet chalk. Nasty. I had them remake my girl's coffee, and I stuck with mine. I wasn't content at all, but didn't want the hassle of them remaking two drinks. So hers came back, this time with steamed milk; but still, the coffee just wasn't good. I'm sorry - it wasn't. She and I both agreed that it tasted little better than Folger's. There was no depth, no fruit or chocolate notes, nothing. And this coming from a pour over! I can't imagine what a drip brew would taste like.   My latte, aside from the persistent chalk texture, also had no flavor. The white chocolate was non-existent. The espresso, barely distinguishable at all. It really didn't even taste like there was any in there. I've tried nearly every coffee place's latte in the Tempe and Scottsdale area, so I have a fair idea of what is good and what is not. Again, very disappointing, especially since the menu looked so promising. And the kicker to all this is the peach pie had no flavor, no life, nothing. It tasted like a frozen pie that had been defrosted and was sitting out for hours. This supposedly being a made from scratch pastry! Oh, and the barista forgot to even bring it to us, immediately after we ordered it. We had to remind her.   The people were fairly nice, and the space was inviting, which saves this place from being a one star in my book. But I know we will certainly not be back. That's a shame, because with the location, layout, and interesting drink selections, this place has potential. Right now though, it just seems all for show. A good artifice with no substance.~coconut milk milk white coffee coffee milk pastries, peach pie. pie coffee milk. coffee, milk; coffee white coffee peach pie pie ~2
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Bh8sI7xXkyn7pzH4b8mdAw~The iced mint tea is very refreshing and the normal (NOT FLAVORED) cold brew is also very good. I tried the coconut flavored cold brew the first time I went and it was...weird. The flavors don't meld in a pleasing way. Their normal cold brew has a great flavor, it's not too acidic. I like the location, and it is a great place for studying, with lots of tables and outlets. I had been there a few times before and always had great service (one of the baristas, Emily, always gives good recommendations) but on my last visit, one of the male baristas was very rude and condescending. I probably won't be back, because I am uninterested in feeling judged for what I order. It would have definitely been my daily study spot this summer, had it not been for him.~tea coconut ~3
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~RwKYk8jx213Z1DZ61DzQOw~You guys...  They make their perfectly-piped pastries and almond macadamia nut milk in-house... That's just how I had to start this review.  But seriously, this place is a winner. The set-up is unlike any other coffee shop. It's open but you find yourself in your own world once you sit down. During our first visit, my boyfriend and I ordered a chai and banana bread. The chai was a 4/5 but the banana bread was so good, we went to order another one. The girl at the counter gave us another banana bread for half off and threw in a coffee cake for FREE... just because!  I've gotten a few lattes and drip coffees since, and they've all been pretty tasty! This is the spot for you if you're in your twenties, looking for a comforting baked good, need your coffee in a rush, or need a place to work/study. We probably come here twice a week now.

0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Q71GCnterKVFlARdlVvcMQ~First visit was just OK.  Felt like I was sitting in a garage building.  The coffee and pastry bar sits in a corner far from the entrance doors.  Owners/management: please put up better menu signs to allow first-timers and those who do not know what's available to choose, instead of feeling pressured to order something fast at the cash register- the menu was on plaques placed right in front of the register.  There were a few pastries on display, but the ones that caught my attention were on one of the guest tables.  Looked like bruschetta, but with nutella and chunky nuts.  Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.  I liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme brûlée coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.  The female rep here told the new guy that he must stress that everything here is made in-house, from the cold brews steeped with herbs, spices, and fruits the night before, to the hazelnut-chocolate spread and the caramel syrup and melted chocolate used in coffees.    I wished I'd gone with the huge chocolate chip cookie with the house-made hazelnut-chocolate spread, instead of the tiramisu...  I may come back for a second visit, but not before I check out all the other coffee shops I've bookmarked for years.  #770~coffee pastries apple coconut. apple milk coffee caramel coffee ~3
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Qm8AY0PleeIcsHDUCY_iWA~Had just gotten my hair cut and was headed to get bagels when I saw a sign for this new place in Cornerstone and thought "Might as well check it out, support local." Quite glad I did. Got a blueberry and lime iced tea and blueberry muffin to go. They were both excellent and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely go back.~lime tea ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~kqlXO6HurqFUbldF8fDFkA~Nice little place close to ASU. Kind of a hipster-y spot, so I can see why it's popular with the college kids. Very spacious dining/lounging area. One complaint is that the furniture is super uncomfortable. It's a lot of hard metal and wood with no cushioning. So I don't think it's a place I'd like to sit and do my paperwork for too long. Definitely not a cozy feeling. But the decor is very modern, and a little industrial looking, with lots of dangling glass light fixtures. I would describe the decor as the city of Denver in coffee shop form haha! I ordered an oatmeal cream pie and a raspberry iced tea. The tea was on par with the quality of Starbucks, so pretty good. The oatmeal cream pie was BOMB. I had eaten most of it before I remembered to take a picture of it lol! I placed my order with a young girl who's calling in life is probably to be a barista. She was very enthusiastic, helpful, and friendly. Positive experience overall.~coffee pie tea. tea pie ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~_Yv14f8rUeNC5snHrGjtYg~Loved the decor and vibe. Had the Salted Brulee latte and a walnut blondie per first-timers recommendation from the barista. The latte was great, though a little sweet for me- I loved the addition of the sugar to get that brulee 'crunch'. The blondie was good, but all too sweet for me... I'll try a muffin or coffee cake next time. Definitely be back!~coffee cake ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~TpGj_OxWZmqS5rPbdtYdIA~Seriously excellent cold brew coffee. The orange zest & vanilla was citrus-y & sweet. Infusing the cold brew instead of adding a syrup takes more effort, but makes for a superior drink. Can't wait to try the rest of the flavors.~coffee. ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~V9MZbE_0mBcpo5g6JQQwXA~Cool coffee shop, great coffee and the cakes and such are amazing too!  I had a cold brew coffee my first time and it didn't disappoint.  Since then I've tried a ton of drinks and have not been let down.  Lots of space and tables to hang out and an amazingly comfortable couch that simply invites a nap, although not appropriate it seems .~coffee coffee coffee ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~aZDFWziFI9EWIeFJpFPmrg~I was very disappointed the first time I came here. I bought a SMALL iced soy latte and their famous cookie. The cookie did not live up to the hype. It was very sweet and the taste was all over the place. The latte was made with dairy. I know this, because a few hours later my stomach was killing me. These two things cost $9. Which is the most expensive I've paid for a pastry and small drink. The place itself is really nice with plenty of seating and outlets. So I decide to try it again. This time I got the berry iced coffee. It was $4 for large iced coffee. Again, not worth it. I'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like, but it tasted burnt and very acidic to me. Not good. Because I really wanted to like this place, I went one last time. Again, small iced soy latte. Tasted like watered down milk. It had no smooth coffee or even soy milk taste! Just like water. Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend. Spend your money on better tasting coffee.~coffee. coffee. milk. coffee milk coffee. ~2
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~LKC2rIr3nRv6CV125Fnzwg~It's always great to support local businesses...especially those with owners who are ASU alums!!   Hazelrock was a stumble find as I was on my way to einstiens. I believe it just opened up just recently and I hope it lasts! I mean I'm always traveling for work and won't be able to frequent this establishment as much as I'd like, but it's a great spot in general for when I am back. The space is HUGE! I'm not sure if there is a bigger coffee spot in Tempe. The atmosphere is inviting with vintage decor and a friendly staff.   As for the tea and sweets, I tried this blueberry infused black tea. It was naturally sweetened by the blueberry but I'm happy that they don't normally add any additional sugar to it since I don't prefer sweet teas. It was very refreshing!! The snow-style shaved ice was really yummy too! The mango flavor was very tasty. I had it topped with fresh fruit, and it was a great combination. I haven't found many snow places here where the snow itself was flavorful so I'm (again) hoping this place is here to stay.   I intend to come back and try the other sweets because they have a whole display case of them!~coffee tea tea. mango ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~_U2abyhcHpbArmapCJfT6Q~Great place to kick up your feet and have an ice cold brewed coffee. Rustic/modern decor with couches so comfy you would fall asleep on if it wasn't for the caffeine.~coffee. ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~IWQGFEua8y47wWDtg_ZRyw~This place has excellent coffee, good service, and very fresh modern design. I'm a fan! They could use more power outlets though.~coffee, ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~eiOX51FfTr3tI4jOO6ycNA~Probably the best blueberry muffin I've ever had! Flavor/texture was perfect and it wasn't too sweet like most places make them. The barista was super friendly, patient, and helpful. Coffee was rich and flavorful. Can't wait to go back to try other pastries and some of their other coffee options!~coffee pastries coffee ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~007u5zSRxQhZaF-vFcWQEA~Cheryl B told me about a new coffee shop that's pretty close to where I live, I'm always up to checking out new places, so off we went to try out some coffee and sweets.  This place is spacious! Love the light fixtures, they are too cool, the wall deco is great too, I'm sure most would just come for the sweets & coffee, but this place has a nice relaxed vibe to it that you just want to go head and have your coffee there, and just relax for a minute.  After checking out the pastries on display I went with the chocolate vanilla bean cupcake and a salted brulee latte. The cupcake was heavenly, the buttercream frosting was just the right amount of vanilla, and the cupcake was moist and perfect. The winner though was the Salted Brulee Latte, oh that is a great latte, the torched of the sugar on top with the warm rich coffee below, it's a cup of heaven I tell you! Glad to have found a new coffee spot in my hood, I'm sure I will be back plenty of times~coffee coffee coffee, coffee pastries coffee coffee ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~2Mp1JpfkrCUcLICN2ASYCg~BlackBerry lime iced team is amazing and kid approved. The pastries are delicious and so far this is moving up to be one of my new favorite places.~lime pastries ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~bKlgCaBAyIWb2Q_TpLNw_Q~A little expensive.  The cold brew coffee is an experience.  I had the ginger coffee which had a nice spicy kick, very different from anything I've tried.  Their shaved ice is awesome and melt in your melt, really delicious flavor and perfect if paired with some fresh fruit or the fruit syrup.  Haven't tried the sweets, only brewed coffee and shaved ice.~coffee ginger coffee coffee ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~DsdAiF_5oERn-Lu8etFq5A~Hazelrock was such a sweet surprise! Went in for the first time this morning and could not have been happier. I ordered the coconut cold brew which was sweet but not overpowering and not too acidic. My friend enjoyed the Sumatra cold brew as well. The barista was super knowledgable and friendly when explaining all of the different flavors and brews they offer. The space is huge and has large clean tables that are perfect for getting work done, and the ones along the wall has access to outlets. Overall, I can see myself coming here a lot to meet friends or post up and get some work done. Def worth a visit!~coconut ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~N8SjRgt5JWzVcjaQguUhqw~Hooray for new coffee! Well, let me say, new coffee shop, as they use an established local roaster for their beans (Cortez I think). This shop is large, very large, and has a giant case of pastries. I have been twice, the lattes have been delicious both times (or maybe once I got a cortado?) and the pastries have ranged from omg amazing to very good. The first time we came, I got the espresso brownie.... took it home, ate it 1-2 days later.... I thought I had died it was so delicious. Just rich chocolate with walnuts and pecans.... trust me, it was great. The next time, I had the nutella pie, which was good, but heavy on the whipped cream and brought another brownie home. Ate it the next day.... not as good as the first go around, but good. I'll definitely be back.~coffee! coffee pastries. pastries pie, ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~ZhcXwBFaPSyVaS0SVGTLlg~Good staff and knowledgeable baristas.   As I sit here, it occurs to me that I've only had the cold/iced drinks. They were good, but I'd imagine I'll enjoy the hot drinks even more, as they're made to SCAA (and soon to be SCEA) specifications.   Their Ferraro cookies are fantastic, and the tiramisu provided a good counterpoint to the coffee.   The music can be a bit intrusive for a subdued conversation, and there could be more comfortable chairs, but this is a place that seems focussed on small-batch, in-house food and drink, and they do these well.~cookies coffee. ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~g4uhCpo66yQsRhRvcL0eSg~I won't ever go back to this place. I ordered a coffee flight, at 10 am and they were out of one of them. So I only received 3 for the price of four. They offered me a free pastry, which was nice, but since I had already eaten one, that was hard to stomach, wasn't at all what I wanted.  My boyfriend ordered the white chocolate mocha, which was served with spoiled milk. When I let the Batista know, she indicated that I didn't know what sour milk, tastes or smells like, and suggested that it was the real white chocolate that they use. (There isn't such a thing as real white chocolate) and surely it shouldn't taste like spoiled milk.   17 dollars later I left very very dissapointed wanting Dutch Brothers.~coffee white milk. milk, white white milk. ~1
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Mp6cxGEY7LQHJaNi_wQNGw~Really glad to see this place open up, as since I work right in this area, I'm constantly running to the Einstein's next door for coffee. The coffee there is fine, but it's always kind of a weird, tense shitshow in there. I was glad to see that the baristas in Hazelrock were not fronting the  typical coffee-chain overhyped, aggressively sunny demeanor and just spoke like real humans. Thank you.  The interior is spacious, open, and extremely clean and polished. Great care was taken to design the menu boards and they're packed with information about their proprietary beans: tasting notes, production information, growing regions (today it was Brazil, Ethiopia and Cameroon). I personally was thrilled to see this, and excited about the prospect of choosing a bean (I went with the Ethiopian).  After ordering, I waited a few minutes and was given an iced coffee when I had wanted hot. The barista was apologetic and mentioned that she "just assumed" and I admitted that I didn't specify, either. However, I do think that if you don't specify, it should be hot. Isn't that the default? At any rate, I just ended up going with the iced coffee since I was in a hurry (and anyone who knows iced coffee knows that Ethiopian beans are the best for iced anyway.) No big deal. The coffee itself was great, by the way. Bright, vibrant notes, smooth and intense. Yes.   When it comes down to it, all the high-concept, coffee-as-the-new-wine, making-the-gourmet-the-norm is essential, and there is a market for it, and it's necessary to raise the bar and lift us from the depths of the bottom of Einstein's brown-stained coffee urn, but you also have to be able to take orders, and make drinks fast and not have your baristas short circuit and blow up when someone orders "just a decaf, please". I think the real mark of excellence in coffee comes from a certain subtlety: exceptional coffee that doesn't need to be dressed up and called out by a long list of pseudo-Italian terms. Good coffee can be served black, as-is, and stand on its own. And no matter how you market it, if it's a good roast, people will notice.~coffee. coffee coffee- coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee- brown- coffee coffee coffee coffee ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~lVU_2r_nIjLi7UeyrovggA~Ina Garten said, "You can be miserable before you have a cookie and you can be miserable after you eat a cookie but you can't be miserable while you are eating a cookie." I'm convinced Ina was thinking of the Ferrero Rocher cookie when she said this because this cookie....it is the real deal. Perfectly chocolatey, crunch and indulgent, this signature treat of Hazelrock's can easily be shared, but you probably won't want to.  The pastry case is a first come first serve situation, so once they are out of something, typically they are out of it for the day. Except for the Ferrero Rocher cookie. I've never not seen it in the case and I think its popularity demands that it's in the case at all times. I've also had the coffee cake which was an excellent, not too crumbly, not overly sweet pairing with our beverages. I really liked the Royal Tea latte that I had recently and it made a nice after dinner beverage.   Hazelrock is a big, beautiful open space with lots of tables and workspaces making it perfect for studying or meeting a larger group of friends.  I prefer the couches to the other seating because the chairs are for narrow college freshman whose metabolism has not succumbed to dining hall food and Boone's Farm.  Hazelrock is worth a look if you're in the area and worth the drive if you're not. Do it for the cookie!~coffee cake tea ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~LmDWrKjNwV9-qizYD3yEqw~Pretentious and poor customer service. The only saving grace here is the coffee and atmosphere (when not dealing with the people who work here.~coffee ~3
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~OeE7rrq9MSXytdqjAOeYSQ~So I've been back to Hazelrock twice since my first time and I can only bump it up one star.  On my second visit, I came with a friend. I ordered a latte (they don't do flavoured lattes and it's weird that the employee didn't suggest the salted brúlée latte that several people seem to be raving about in the reviews). The latte was OK. I think if you're a coffee person you might appreciate it more. My friend got a hot chocolate with cow's milk and he thought it was watery even thou it was made with whole milk. We also tried some of the sweets: the chocolate banana tart and the ferrero rocher cookie. I don't recommend eating any of these by yourself. Make sure you share it because they are hella sweet. Not a bad thing necessarily if that's what you like. The banana chocolate tart was delicious. It has real pieces of banana in there. No laffy taffy, artificial banana flavour. I enjoyed it. The cookie is a chocolate chip cookie with nutella and hazelnuts on top. Obviously it's delicious. On my third visit, I got an iced tea. I believe it was a berry black tea. I added a couple teaspoons of sugar to it and it was good.   I haven't been wowed by any drink from this place so I give them 1 star for that.  The two sweets that I've tried were both very good so I give them + 2 stars. That brings them to a 3 out of 5. I'm not keen to give another star for service because the employees always seem clueless about what they have. Anytime there is a girl at the register she has to ask the guy who makes the drinks what milk they have or what is in a particular drink. You should know what's in your product. Owner needs to train consistently.    I'd only go back to try the other sweets but I won't go out of my way to visit.~coffee milk milk. banana banana banana banana tea. tea. milk ~3
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~zqlWLc-oM7hPSf01p30-dw~New cafe with delicious treats, good coffee and large open space. What more could you want?  Got a latte and a cold brew the times I visited and got the Ferrero Rocher cookie per Yelp's recommendations and thoroughly enjoyed it. The latte definitely gives you that kick of caffeine and the staff is always willing to answer any questions you may have. They do have a cool variety of cold brews where do steep certain ingredients i.e. cinnamon or coconut to infuse flavors and did their best to answer their methods and so on. The Ferrero Rocher cookie is for those with a killer sweet tooth! It's a soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie topped with Nutella and chopped hazelnuts ... what? I know! It's amazing.  The wi-fi is fast, there's tons of seating for groups, pairs or for the lone person. Interior is well lit, good amount of outlets and natural lighting from the windows and artificial ones over head. Never found it to be too loud either. The parking is not an issue and it's located in a plaza with other food spots!  Will be back for their cold brew tasting/flight!~coffee coconut ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Bj_LxU5eF5Mr959FVmyEAw~I had been wanting to come here since it opened and finally had a chance a few months ago. My husband, my sister-in-law, and I came on a Saturday morning. My sister-in-law ordered an iced tea and I ordered a crème brulee latte and a blueberry muffin. The latte was delicious. I loved that they blowtorched some sugar on top and the added flavor was great. The muffin... oh man. Yum! It was super soft and full of blueberries. I shared with my husband - big mistake. He liked it just as much and it was gone much quicker!   The inside of the building is really fun and a little hipster/industrial. There is a lot of wood paneling, fun tables/chairs, a corner with board games, and seating outside. There is a large display case with treats and a long bar area for ordering and picking up your drinks. The building is huge and it feels open/spacious. If I was a student, I'd love to come here for a drink and to get some work done or just relax.  Overall, it's a great place. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back. Unfortunately, it looks like it might be closed? I hope not!~tea ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~N3e3KF8EqcvDS8mmQGs5WA~Went in today and got the salted brûlée latte which was very delicious. My friend got a cold brew with coconut milk I believe and that on the other hand was kind of strange tasting. Did not try their baked items but they looked very good. However I read one of the other comments that stated that they don't do flavored lattes, not sure if that is true but if it is that is very disappointing. All in all, I had a good first experience here but will perhaps update after further visits.~coconut milk ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~EyDR1bHJ-zkwL9fJSCt8UA~I like this place. It's a welcome addition to the ASU area because I've been getting tired of the other coffee shop that's close by. It's nice and open with lots of seating, fast wifi, and they have yummy desserts. My only gripe is that they close at 9 pm AND they are closed for winter break. At least stay open until 10pm....this is a college town guys.~coffee desserts. ~3
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~Ix5bG-RevENdh0Dl92uDgw~Hazelrock is a relatively new addition to the Tempe coffee scene. They've parked themselves in a very fortuitous location, too - smart move, guys. Why don't we get right down to business:  PROS: Just about everything. Plenty of space, plenty of seating, plenty of *comfortable* seating, always bright and clean, a growing calendar of events (including, as I found out by accident the other night, magic shows!), a polite staff, a decent menu. Hazelrock quickly became an almost-daily go-to for me. I absolutely love the atmosphere. REALLY great place for hanging out, playing board games, studying - whatever. Good place for groups, good place for individuals. You really can't go wrong with this one.  CONS: Only one minor con, and I blame this on my snobbiness when it comes to coffee. I've noticed a pretty conspicuous inconsistency in product quality. Not sure what to attribute this to, but the fact is, Hazelrock has a lot to compete against in this area. If they can take just that *little* bit of extra pride in how their coffee is prepared, it would up my review from four stars to five.  CONCLUSION: All in all, a great addition to the budding coffee economy. Not the best coffee in the area (yet - they're still young!), but definitely one of the better locations and settings in the area. A very nice craft addition to an otherwise college area. If you haven't been, it's worth a go. You'll likely find yourself visiting often.  Good job, Hazelrock! Keep up the good work.  :)~coffee coffee. coffee coffee coffee ~4
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~2UGZbMRQ_WbsNM9dKR9YYA~If their Tiramisu cake is any indication of their other sweets, I'll be back very soon and often.  The cake was light and flavorful yet not too sweet and just the right balance of cocoa on top.   I can't wait to try their other sweets!   Thanks HazelROCK!!~cake cake ~5
0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~s95lrw2hBzkWbDBlv4hRUw~Loved this place!! The atmosphere is very unique and fun. There was lots of art and interesting decor to look at! Customer service was great! Brandy was our barista and she was super nice! The coffee was great (vanilla latte) and so was the almond croissant that I had!

0x2qB4R790SX3W4W8FQuWA~dPUgCaiiV8PTMVVk6uhviw~Woah first review?! I guess this place is new. Overall summary: tastes as good as it looks!  Stumbled randomly into this cafe / coffee / bakery on a Saturday afternoon. Originally wanted an iced mocha but the sweets looked soooo good. Couldn't help myself!  Let's get the drink review out of the way first. Cuz I'm more of a dessert person anyway. Iced mocha was great. Light and refreshing. The manager said that the mocha had real shredded chocolate on it- nice touch!  Now. The baked goods! Mmmmmm. Tried the Ferrero cookie, chocolate banana tart, white chocolate macadamia cookie, and mango flavored shaved ice (is that a thing here?). Come with a group- these treats are pretty big but shareable so it was awesome that I could taste multiple things. My favorite is the Ferrero cookie (AMAZING. Great chocolate and nutty flavor. Soft and decadent) but all of them were pretty great.  Space is really big. Lots of tables and seating. Decor is kinda hipster/rustic look. They need to add some art though on the walls to spruce the place up.  The manager and staff were very friendly. Came to our table and asked us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Ultimately led to a conversation about coffee. I'm no coffee connoisseur but dude knew his coffee thing. Glad to see passionate people running local businesses.~coffee / banana white mango coffee. coffee coffee ~5
2PqCZxon6AZHJrQ5iam4LA~6aldHbF3FeWKglU90NiVCg~No no no no! Where do I start, perhaps slapping myself in the face for not having read the only other review on this place BEFORE crossing the threshold of the Clifton Fish Bar.   To cut a long story short, I ordered a pizza with salami, peppers, mushrooms and anchovies. Simple. 45 mins later I received a pizza with peppers and anchovies. On quizzing the (grumpy) guy behind the counter as to the invisible ingredients i had ordered and paid for, he told me they didn't have any mushrooms or salami left. "Then why didn't you tell me this small, insignificant fact at the time i ordered, or subsequent 45 mins whilst I was in your shop?"...no reply other than a look of get outa my shop. Appalling.   And how was the pizza you ask? Don't know, ask the rubbish bin not far from his shop.  If I could give 0 stars for this place, I would.~pizza salami, mushrooms pizza mushrooms salami pizza ~1
2PqCZxon6AZHJrQ5iam4LA~VD5kJRQu-cYcQoYZTinHrA~This is a very tough place to review, seeing as I have only been there once and that was a good while ago and I found that it was like any other standard chippy. The chips were not great, but didn't taste like cardboard, which is a bonus, and the smoked sausage was fine.  However, Clifton Fish Bar was last year fined for poor hygiene during a standard hygiene test. On hearing this news, I felt a bit sick that I had actually eaten there as the test had found dead mice and mice droppings in the shop. However, it must be noted that subsequent to this, the shop has cleaned its act up and although the owner says that he was not aware of any mouse problem, he has put in measures to make sure that such an issue will not arise in the future. It must be hard for a business to regain its reputation after such an issue, but the best thing that it does do is give you confidence that the place is now clean.~chips sausage ~2

Not just that, but this place has the biggest infestation of douche bags. You need a gas mask just to cut through the Axe, bronzer, and fumes of hair gel that linger throughout the air. If you want a visual of what this place looks like on the weekend, take a gander at: www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com . Click it. It's a real site and it's what this place and its patrons looks like. If you model your style of dress and behavior after VH1 reality shows, drop in for a swig and some high-fives from your fellow date rapists. If not, just pray in thanks that Scottsdale is where it's at and everything you love is where it is.  There's a live band that plays and I'm not a fan, mainly because it's not my type of music. They play alot of butt rock and the like... basically stuff you'd expect a cruise ship band to have jam sessions to in about 20 years.  The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star as opposed to none (if that were an option) is that the staff is pretty good. They tend to see that everything is going good and do a good job of bringing what you've ordered on time. Lastly, I feel bad for alot of the waitresses. How they put up with a crowd that takes pointers from episodes of Rock of Love and Tool Academy, I will never know.~date ~1

As I am admittedly claustrophobic I enjoyed the outdoor space majorly. The drinks were good and strong, but I dont know about the prices. I was there with a Detroit crowd (I guess all of Detroit moves to Phx) and for some reason I didnt have to pay for anything.   Music was ok, nothing special, just the usual crowd pleasers and some people, mostly MILFS and GILFS (think about it) tried to dance. Gosh, please, white people, dont dance. I know, I am white, but there is a reason I date Latinas only! Mmm, what about if I am a woman and go there - how would I rate the guyz? - besides one really normal and nice guy who hit on one of my female friends - I would probably puke on the dance floor.   Overall scene: douches and DDs. Nothing special at all.  Btw: While girls go out to "DANCE" with their girls, we guys do not go out to just "DANCE" with our buddies!~white white, date ~3
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~iQu5pgsbv_8aUMy4AQmMXA~Sutra no longer offers 50% off on Tuesday nights... but Barcelona does.  So, that's where we found ourselves meeting some friends tonight for dinner and drinks.  It was a beautiful evening, so we sat outside on the patio.  We went back and forth on using the heat lamps provided.  Chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be but perhaps a tad bit on the ditzy side.  The guys seemed to admire looking at her (bustier) every time she leaned over the table, and I was nervous something was going to pop out.  Aside from that entertainment, the food was decent.  It was not amazing.  I had the chopped salad which was pretty good and big enough to share, followed by the sea bass (no surprise there) entree.  Jared had an 8 oz filet and Zack had a ribeye.  We all shared spinach and sweet potato fries as sides, and the guys each had dessert.  I didn't have any (ahem - wedding diet), but they seemed to be orgasming over the chocolate lava cake... the cheese cake and berry dessert also went over well at the table.  With the 50% off Tuesday special, this was $30 per person with tip.  For the amount of food we got, this was a deal, but had we payed full price? Not so much...   If I return, it will be on a Tuesday night for the 1/2 off special.  Other than that, I'm not really interested.~salad spinach sweet potato ~3
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~BiUfgKHtOZI5JpV_lF66lQ~Bills itself as trendy, upscale supper club.  The food was good and the service so-so. The one thing that stands out was the "southwestern" lobster bisque.  No mention of anything other than regular lobster bisque, but was suprised to find corn in my bisque. Call me old fashioned but I don't like chewing my bisque.   My steak from what I remembered was decent. A little pricey for the atmosphere. Can't take the food too seriously when the music is blaring so loudly.~corn steak ~3
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~L5nMOOBT4Mmpuf5ZB85nMw~Damn, if this is not the perfect place to meet women. I read some reviews about cougars, well I like milf's. For one, for this fantasy to come true it better happen soon as, I am 36 years old, and the age I prefer to date for long term decreases by the minute. Anyway, this place has people of all ages that is what I liked best. I do wish they had a place of this caliber in the bay area then I wouldnt be single. Then, again, I never met a girl friend at a bar. Anyway, Arizona women are better than Miami. The jury is still out on Texas which most of my guy friends seem to say are the top of the states. Arizona women are amazing.  Okay, back to barcelona if you want to indoor lounge they got it, want to hang out outside got it, want to dance on the dance floor got it. Whatever type of person you are, this is a great place to go if you are the type who can make your own fun.~date ~5
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~v-QJm4FNi1bhs3yG0GL6fg~Every bar I have ever walked into has had an alarmingly poor ratio of men to women (too many men and not enough women). I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go. Where is that place? That question was once rhetorical. It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's.   We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage. We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp; they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts). The portions were more than generous for each person at the table. I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good. They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream. We all left extremely full and even more satisfied with the meal.   The place is a little pricey, but Barcelona's is easily my new "go-to" restaurant in Scottsdale. Attire is casual through professional.   Barcelona's is located on the Greenway-Hayden Loop east of Scottsdale Road.   I can't wait to get back.~appetizers, shrimp; ice cream. ~4
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~1A4Sk_lhHTDJCeGcmsH04A~edited to add: CLOSED! GOOD!  my folks went to Barcelona for Valentine's Day and it was HORRIBLE.  First of all, they put the valet parking in the middle of the parking lot. WTF? I thought you paid for valet so you didn't have to walk!  The meal was terrible. Paella - shell bits in it. My mom got sick from the seafood, as soon as she got home she had terrible runs and felt horrible the next day.  My father likes pepper on his food. They asked for some pepper, a guy came by and gave a quick twist with the pepper grinder and BAM! he was gone.  Well he wanted more pepper so when they FINALLY flagged down the waitress, they asked for more pepper. She brought them a pepper shaker. :-(  The pepper shaker wasn't working right for my father, he could not get anything out of it, Danny himself came by and asked how things were. My father told him he couldn't get the pepper shaker to work. Danny said, "Great, I'm glad to hear it!" and left. WTF?  oh and when some apparent VIPs came in, my folks were completely ignored.  They dropped nearly $300 there! What a joke. If you want a good meal, AVOID Barcelona.~paella - ~1
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~HHwoOnBEKaxxa1lbY28FIw~Barcelona was a great restaurant years ago and had the best paella in Scottsdale. Today, Barcelona is supposed to be a club scene, but in actuality, it's fairly empty.   This place lost its focus and reminds me of Maestro's in the OC.~paella ~2
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~UYNrrxJf3FLeisyo0m4_-A~This place sucked. First of all, as an out of towner- I have never seen so many old fake orange women in my life. I felt like I was in an episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County: Scottsdale Edition. I am just bitter because I came here for a joyous occasion of a wedding VIP party, but I was denied access at the door because I was wearing tennis shoes. Gimme a break, my shoes weren't some  salvation army shoes. They were quite expensive "plaid original chucks" that had character and style. They still denied me in after I complained saying I have never had a problem in LA, SF, NY, VEGAS but clearly Scottsdale I do.    Anyways, after the $10 cover charge, they gave me a ticket for a free fish taco or something. Sick. I don't want to eat fish tacos at 11pm. This place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory after dark. Everyone is old. They don't have a DJ, instead they have a band that does bad covers of bad songs like "Wind it Up" and "Glamorous".   Worst part? I saw old guys wearing phat farm tennis shoes and mandals. How the hell are mandals allowed at a club but trendy kicks aren't?  Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to get picked up by a lonely horny housewife of Scottsdale. The themesong to this place should be Nelly's MANEATER.~taco tacos ~1
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~f2S4qKbSPn6L0ZjQWSFtVQ~Don't quite think it's bringing sexy back....  What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?  Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.  Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.  Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.  This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.  The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.  Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.  $9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?  Funny, funny place.  I'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching.  This place doesn't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices.  At least sugar daddies abound at this place.~salad bacon mozzarella sweet potato ~3
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~PdvZX0tILXa5DHTydPmJeg~Massive Scottsdale scene - fake rich guys and plastic women.  Went here for a business meeting and we both ordered steaks which came out extremely rare and had to be sent back.  The waiter forgot other stuff and the food was mediocre at best considering the prices.  The restaurant is run very strangely ... bouncer type guys with ear piece walkie talkie things come around every 15 minutes to make sure everything is going OK ... but in a harassing way.  This place may be heaven for some, but if gaudy large scale club atmospheres with an annoying crowd ain't your thang... stay away.~steaks ~2
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~WmB7c0AVaPmhctggsaBP8Q~Oh Barcelona, I visited you with low expectations - and you didn't disappoint.  A lovely young woman of my recent acquaintance invited me here recently for the purpose of attending a birthday party for a friend of hers. Neither of us would have come here otherwise.   If you're thinking about going, don't do it. If you care for the deets, read on. If not, stop reading here and.... go somewhere else. Please.   We show up at about 8 for drinks and dinner. I wasn't in a drinking mood, my date's Appletini was pretty Appley but the amount of liquor was tini. Must be why they call it an Appletini. Hm. Highlight was the bread brought to the table - the pretzel rolls were the highlight of the evening. How sad is that?  Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.  I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato.   My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement.   Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain.   While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam.   The crowd is douchey. The food is awful and on the pricey side. The service, spotty.   If you're coming for the thing Barcelona is famous for, you'll find a lot of it. If not, stay away. Far, far away.~date paella, pasta onion rings. beef. fries potato. date pasta shrimp shrimp pasta pasta cheese ~1
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~ZbevnNTg6RBx-AJYrdwEjQ~Plain and simple this place sucks! The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu. This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress. I ordered a steak medium rare, I was given a burnt piece of meat. I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. This place can't do food or entertainment. The entertainment was called Envy. What a joke! They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful. No accounting for taste. If you go to Scottsdale, take a pass on this place...its overpriced. What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ! Or and they should invest in a better chef.~steak butter soup ~1
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~J4bnwveuNb0dxoxWedisZg~Ok, so the atmosphere is great here in terms of being upscale, but there are some negatives.  1.  Cougars on the prowl - lots of hot, old women who are on the prowl for younger guys....they are full of botox and silicone.  I guess this isn't always a negative, as it does help boost ones ego, but sometimes the way that they are desperate is sort of lame.  2.  BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.  3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.  4.  Lounge singers - they have had the same lounge singers, singing the same songs for years.  I thought that the girl was hot, but she's more of a Monet (good from afar, but all messed up when looking up close)  All in all, I give them a 3 for entertainment value (humor).  This isn't exactly the best nightclub in the world though.~bbq chicken ~3
4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw~_Yq4KPS7_UFTGcOaTzsuxg~Snotsdale at its finest! This place is a large bar/night club that was built by Danny, of Danny's car wash fame, who made millions keeping cars clean against the dust storms and monsoons of the Valley of the Sun, and needed a good place where he could go dancing with his woman.   It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their "shooters" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall.   Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.    The food and drinks are overpriced; the eye candy plentiful; and reality is far, far away. Bring your Cheesehead friends from Wisconsin in November and they will be impressed.~paella ~3
8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ~PK22124GDh6PpslqgJOkOw~I had stopped by The Blue Moon a few years ago during a drive across country.  I had gotten a $20 day pass,  and had a pretty good time by the pool with my friend.    At a time, there had been some porn stars frolicking in the water, they were making hamburgers (the staff, not the porn stars),  and the place had a sort of 80's, West Hollywood-camp charm.  Recently I headed to a trade show in Vegas, and for the first time my hotel room wasn't being paid for by my job, so I decided to try out the Blue Moon.  PROS:    For me, I like that it's off the strip. (Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.  Since it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.  There is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.  There is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.  CONS:     Don't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.    If you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.  If you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?~coffee, ~4
8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ~S8Jg8rkG4AyxtVj6cASoGQ~Okay - went for the first time - and - well - It took me about 24 hours to really appreciate this place.  It is not right on the strip but holy cow you can drive up a side street - take a left and drive right into the Wynn and park.  For those of you used to lots of luxury - this is not your place to go.  I am a bit spoiled - but I appreciated the slow pace and the men's only atmosphere.   I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the slow pace.    There are only a few things I would ask that they do.  1) have each room set up with a book that details the locations and areas of the different things for the hotel.  2) there needs to be an monthly updated calander in the each room  3) there needs to be a better list of gay clubs and venues as well as the times and locations,.  4)Towels need to be replaced and all the lights in the rooms need to work.  5) The coffee in the rooms needs to be free.  2 bucks for in room coffee is a pain in the butt.  Raise the room rates a smidge to help cover it.   This in an older hotel and I understand that - for those of you who can,..get a suite on the pool side of the hotel.  It cuts down on noise.  You can also peek at your car in the lot.  Staff is great - be prepared for the fact that most of us who can afford to vacation have worked our lives and are not so excellent looking,..LOL!  All in all - I would encourage you to try it - get the parlor suite - pool side view and dont go in with attitude. The convience to get to the strip is awesome if u have your own car.~coffee coffee ~4
8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ~2xICJxlUS5O6ruN-A993tA~I've been going to the Blue Moon for various events, from early Banana Hammock Sundays to Tuesday night socials and Sunday BBQ's.  I've also stayed here a couple of times before my last stay.  The other reviews are right on the money about the owner and the staff.  John Hessling clearly understands customer service. It is the reason why I booked a stay there a few days while the moving truck where I was relocating from was en route to Vegas.  There is also an unnecessary snarky side to the operation and seems to prevail staff-wide. Asking for extra towels or to let a guest's visitor into the property within a reasonable amount of time (was my brother-in-law, not a trick), is not an extraordinary request.  I can understand why one would feel bothered if the room was comped.  But it wasn't. I think the owner and staff have lost sight of the fact that guests are choosing to stay there rather than the Wynn (where it was cheaper for the time of my stay at Blue Moon).  When inquiring about certain clubs, I was told by the staff at the front desk they weren't allowed to promote some of them and were directed to send me to certain venues. Not illegal, nor a surprise. But pretty crappy way to deny a guest an experience.  Mr. Hessling also has a blog where he pens somewhat bitchy copy under the name PERSON OF INTEREST and runs a hook-up app called Bent, which, though I indulge in both, is probably hurting his attention to the details at the Blue Moon.   Sadly, it is unlikely I will come back here, nor recommend it, until it gets back into the the tip-top shape it once was--and can be again.  As for the neighborhood, this is all subjective. No one has ever been mugged, murdered, accosted (unwillingly, at least) in the area.  Hessling does put a premium on security, and for that, I have to give him credit.~banana ~2
8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ~EMqJ3_3SxxBI2VOVaATfyA~Okay, let me state the pros up front just to be fair.   David is the owner and he does answer the phone, and gets up to the front desk fairly quickly when you walk in.    Be aware that the day pass is only good until 8pm, then light's out honey, on your way home if you are visiting without having a room there.    They do have a very nice pool with a waterfall shower, and privatized (walled-in jacuzzi).  It is clothing optional, so try to be nice to those who are over-endowed :)  Also, to be fair, the whole place looked clean.    Finally, decor and music are totally gay chic, good for him.   To be fair, I didn't stay in the hotel part, so you'll have to check for yourself on their quality.  Hopefully that matches the price.   Okay now the cons.  First it is really hard to find if you're not local.  Cab drivers haven't heard of it so bring the mapquest with you.   David is kind of a jaded indifferent queen in my opinion.  Okay to be fair, yes it takes one to know one.  But he did something no retail queen should.  I asked him where the towels were and he said oh by the blue tins at the pool - of course when I get over there all the towels in the bin are - you guessed it...WET.   Okay, could happen, he could be busy while supplies don't last, but then he got all huffy about having to get me a clean one.    Also, David, honey really do SOMETHING to upgrade that locker "room".  It looks like it should star in a scene of "OZ" - the one about the prison .  Also, he has that cell phone plastered to his ear.  And not the incoming calls asking questions about the place either.  I really don't like it when retail queens make waiting paying customers seem like we are interrupting their hot gossip session when they are behind the counter.   I know, he and others will say - it's  his place, he can run it the way he wants.  Well, attitude can be everything, and he needs to work on his.  We do keep him in business.  After leaving the interactions with him I only felt slightly welcome to come back, us customers can be SUCH a nuisance when he is trying to have a juicy cell phone conversation.     It's nice that he provides internet, although it's screaming slow to load, and definitely not Comcastic.    Finally, if you plan a massage, they are by appointment, so schedule ahead, their massage guy is really hit and miss.~honey, honey ~3
8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ~wziByssXq4VgQgxmRr74QQ~5 Stars in comparison to the rest of Uber Het Las Vegas.  It may not be as high-end or glam as Bellagio, but in Las Vegas it's the best place to stay to get away from all those playground breeders.   Friendly helpful staff. How many gay resorts have that, instead of attitudinal bitchy queens?   Attractive tastefully decorated common areas.   Continental breakfast enough to get by on.  Clothing-optional, yes.  Music by the pool is too loud. My friend said it was like bath house music. TIP: put pool towels over the green mushroom-like speakers and it deadens the sound a bit.  Finally, it's so nice to be with your own kind.~mushroom- ~5
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~FKAQCd7guO_o6oHTTyTepg~On my on-going quest for reasonably-priced and delicious Indian food in the Chandler area, a friend and I checked this place out tonight.    The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.  Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.  The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.    I probably won't come back here, although it was decent.  Still not exactly what I'm looking for.~appetizers, chicken pakoras garlic ~3
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~D4dxkypFBS4TAVj5wt7w1g~Alright here's the skinny: no beef (Indian cuisine!), lots of flavor in authentic and unique recipes, well-kept buffet fare.    Given a table and a chilled bottle of water I got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.    As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl...     The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch. Would give a fifth star for a more competitive price (little high on weekends at $13+ per adult), a slighttlyyy bigger selection, and dinner buffet availability... (All of which can be found at the Indian Oven in Northeast Mesa.) But overall a good bet for lunch in SW Chandler.~beef ( chicken butter chicken chicken egg mango ~4
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~5lStIjfqihoD4I3UGbnL7w~The food is pretty good here, especially the various biryanis they make. They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.    My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!    I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.  The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal. Since they are so confused and can't be bothered to give menus or post the prices and ages, we probably won't go back often.~tandoori chicken ~3
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~thagXgeH2Cjaqz4p9Fg3Kg~Its Friday night, and it's a 1st date night, so I got to pick the place, and I had already confessed my Yelp obsession, but really is it an obsession when you are continually finding the best of places within your area? Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.  So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!  I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!  Also side note, my date tried the goat biryani and thought it to be spicy and told the owner, who tried it and said yea it's on the spicy side, will make up a new batch right now, now to me that's excellent service!     I hope to see Matka stays around because I sure do plan on coming back!~date date cauliflower potato butter chicken chicken butter chicken chicken white biryani date date biryani ~4
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~FJTFufjVeaKwtGoqVZTCug~Tried this place on 4th of July, decent amount of folks eating there that day.  Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.  Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.    Recently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return.  We hadn't planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for 2 entrees, one extra side of bread and a drink.~chicken spinach. lamb vindaloo ~2
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~KhpT8kM4_fgy9OGfiNrhrA~Went for their lunch buffet this afternoon.  The floor of the restaurant had stuff strewn all over- a turn off when you're there to eat, and fail to see how they couldn't have the waitstaff sweep the place in less than 10 mins.  There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped.   There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.  There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched.   A $12.99 buffet needs to be worth that much, and I'm sorry, but Matka isn't worth it, but Chutneys totally is.~paneer tomato paneer butter paneer. chicken mango ~1
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~BOWZDZOQKKVJxDsbDOCRrQ~Saw an empty resturant from outside. Anyway went inside.. It was hotter inside than outside. Papad was cold and old..Sent it back. The food was expensive and BAD !! The is the worst restaurant that I have been in Chandler area.~papad ~1
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~N29Me8KQkxXF9_7YfQoRXA~I had the lunch buffet a week after it opened, and it was really good.  The owner told me he was going to have a Friday and Saturday dinner buffet and I tried it tonight.  Outstanding!  The food was fresh and the chicken and goat dishes were very good.  But for me, the veggie daals, byranni, lentil soup and the Indian eggplant (don't remember the Indian name) was outstanding!!  The owner told me he changes the buffet each day so the food is fresh.  At  $9.99 for a very large buffet on a Saturday nite, it was more than worth a visit.  I'm going back for that mango daal, the tamarind rice, and the egg plant (whatever it's called).  In one word...OUTSTANDING!  It really was that good!~chicken lentil soup ~5
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~-BG7AZmGdoTx5ZGiDn2mtQ~What most people don't realize about Indian food is that it changes from region to region. Most Indian restaurants in this country serve only Punjabi (northern food). Matka specializes in Hyderabadi food. The city of Hyderabad is known all over India for having the most flavorful food with influences from both south and north. I have not had authentic Hyderabadi food outside of Hyderabad until now. It's spicy and full of flavor. The signature dish is their Biryani. And the biryani at Matka is to die for. 100% authentic. They also have a a huge variety in their buffet with many delectable options to choose from. And dinner buffet on weekends. Food is fresh. You can taste the difference. Thank God for this restaurant. I have to eat here at least once a week out i start having withdrawals. Best Indian restaurant in the Valley hands down!~biryani. biryani ~5
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~jYXTBOEOj6hHH65xYeBsqA~I have a good Indian restaurant that I like, but it is a bit far away and not very convenient with the evening traffic. I found Matka without any previous information (they have been here for a couple of months) and decided to try them because they are in such a convenient location (for me).  I had a great buffet lunch.  Very nice naan, very nice papadums, very nice pakoras, stuff that will tell you how good a place is.  I will be back this week for dinner, for sure.~pakoras, ~5
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~kUsehQ04Qgx9dJeM2wTxxw~You can change your name from Matka to Kamat to anything else but if you have to advertise that you are not "recycling" (which is re-serving one customers food to another that may have been untouched), and that all food is cooked daily, you have to seriously wonder!  Quality of the butter chicken was ok . The tandoori chicken was dry and old and they dont follow the online buffet menu: no kheer, only sooji ka halwa which in no way closely resembles a dessert.   I rate this as : "been there done that"  Naan was burnt but masala dosa was a nice touch. They also some how ran out of yogurt and couldnt make a Lassi. Thats like a wing place running out of wing sauce..~butter chicken tandoori chicken ~1
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~x5oZSnkvWNy9pa7lm2M4Ug~We had been there to the lunch buffet on a friday couple of weeks ago and the food was awful. The restaurant itself is very boring with no music or ambience and uninviting. I was hoping that we get some good food there. The papadum tasted horrible probably because of the oil. The Gulab Jamoons were torn apart in the buffet tray and not even a single intact piece was there. The tandoori chicken tray was empty. They did not care to refill the empty food trays. The owner was bit rude when we complained to him of the quality. The buffet itself is about 11.95 + TAX on the week end including friday. I don't mind paying 13 dollars for the food, but not for the food they offer. Chutneys on baseline is a lot better bargain in comparison to this restaurant though the pricing is similar for the buffet.  The only +ve experience was the bottled water they offered at no extra cost and the chicken biriyani. Anyways we decided not to return to this place.~tandoori chicken ~1
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~3blqTcpLUJ1Uj3pT8hiPlg~I went to Matka for dinner and found that they have a buffet.  Food was below average to average.  First of all, the variety seemed rather limited, which is surprising for a buffet.  I'm not at all a vegetarian, but I usually look forward to Indian buffets for the vegetarian choices.  Not so here.  They do have the usual Aloo Gobi (cauliflower dish), Palak Paneer, and the pakoras.  The quality was ok, but nothing special.  As for the meat dishes, the butter chicken rather bland - shocking for butter chicken, I know.  Disappointing :(.  They also had a lamb curry (ok, but not as flavorful as most Indian lamb dishes should be), Chili chicken (actually pretty good!), Chicken vindaloo (average ) and a few other things that I can't remember since they were relatively nondescript.  The price was acceptable.  The decor was typical.  The service was pleasant enough.  I think they just opened - in a way, this means that you can give them the benefit of the doubt.  I probably won't though, since I already know of other Indian restaurants that are better.~cauliflower paneer, pakoras. butter chicken butter chicken, lamb lamb chicken ( chicken ~2
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~bczut6kP0BB8k2u-XQ4ymA~We were shopping around the area when we noticed this restaurant and decided to go in for buffet lunch. The food was typical south Indian with not a lot of good options for Vegetarians.   Me and wife tried out a few dishes - Paneer dish was sweet, the Bagaire Baigan (eggplant) was way too oily. Veggie food only saving grace was sambhar.  I eat meat, so I tried out the chicken biryani which was average, other dishes were average too.  My wife's pregnant so she takes a bit long to finish her food, the restaurant server apparently didn't like that, she was trying to hurry us even though they were open for another half hour and had only 25% tables occupied.~paneer sambhar. chicken biryani ~1
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~daBUTGpkqZoSY_YuJcNp-A~Thought of trying this out for lunch buffet today..We eat out quite frequently but have never been to this one.  Cons: a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone. b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either .. c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present. d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good. c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice. d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet? e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent. f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani. g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better. h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.  I would revisit to give them a fair chance at dinner this month.. But right now it is 1.5 stars..There are better Indian choices at the moment in the valley.~tamarind dal onion. chicken egg butter chicken egg zucchini biryani. biryani. ~2
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~yN6ruubQJBCVmcMuADLCaQ~Definitely good Indian food. Family came by and shared a few dishes. We had the Spring Vegetable Dosa for appetizer that was super yummy. For main course we split the Vegetable Biryani,  Chicken palak,  okra and tomatoes, and goat masala.  Everything was EXCELLENT and super TASTY! If you want good Indian food in Chandler come here!~biryani, chicken okra ~5
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~7PaGSD2rKnDJlu76FByy4A~In short, tasty food with a great flavor. The chicken biriyani is by far the best i have had in phoenix. I have been there for dinner (ordered a la carte') and the lunch buffet which had impressive spread. Also, they provide bottled water at no additional cost.~chicken ~4
3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g~L6s0oiyv5Pbez71o2vcg1w~This has changed ownership and name and is now Kamat (an anagram of Matka, oddly) and is just getting started. This is the third Indian/Pakistani type restaurant in as many years in this location so I imagine it'll be tough going but they''ll have my business.  I've been to Kamat twice now and the food is just lovely. Lunch is buffet of course but for an evening meal they emphasize thali    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali    I had a chicken biryani thali that came with rice, daal, naan, kheer and more....this was a takeaway meal,  when I unpacked it and sampled everything, it made me weak in the knees....so good!  I can't wait to go again and try the goat curry.  It's a small operation so be patient with the staff or try the lunch buffet. I could have given 5 stars for the food but it's early days yet.  I hope they can last.~chicken biryani kheer ~4
19jV_YngqOH0h40IxItUKA~Dro151nt5aPwMbkm2x7zsw~This market is small now, but there is an awesome produce/fruit vendor, a local bread vendor, some specialty type items like honey, salsas, nuts, hummus, and a few other cool things. The guy who set this up owns chronic taco and is also helping with the tempe urban garden, he seems to be passionate about bringing back mill avenue and helping people have access to local fresh food. Ohh and did i mention the prices on the produce and fruit were killer, way cheaper than any organic grocery store. Defiantly worth a try.  Make sure to get some of the honey crisp apples. Amazing.~honey, taco honey ~4
19jV_YngqOH0h40IxItUKA~9vKj0Wus0sia5yUa1h59sg~The Mill Avenue Farmer's Market is the bantam weight of farmer's market's in the valley.    "Weighing in at 113 pounds, in this corner of the valley we have MILL mill AVENUE avenue FARMER'S farmer's MARKET market!  Let's get ready to haggle!!"  When we arrived around 9:45 am there were about 8 stalls, one with produce.  Diminutive comes to mind.  "The Mill Ave. Farmer's Market was reported to be rather diminutive, with only a smattering of stalls and little produce to be found."  Petite.  The Mill Avenue Farmer's Market would need a little padding to run with the college girls, know what I'm saying?  Pee Wee.  The Mill Avenue Farmer's Market had a very good game today at the Kiwanis Rec Center and is now celebrating over Gatorade and granola bars in the picnic area.  You get the idea.  We left to get some coffee and returned about a half hour later to find 3-4 more vendors.  There was a honey vendor, hummus, cookies, produce, a couple sandwich places, flowers...and the one place with produce.  I'll give it some time as they are new.  I'm hoping in a month or so they will have a better turnout of vendors.~coffee honey cookies, sandwich ~2
19jV_YngqOH0h40IxItUKA~K7Pg-quSvXrHD-CP10Y3ew~One star for lack of vendors.  I was really excited to hear that there would be a farmer's market but I'm not sure they should call it that just yet. It should be re-named to one farmer, some hummus and some honey market. Aside from the great smells from the roast beef sammy's there was nothing there that interested me.   Even the produce were lacking, maybe 10 apples a couple oranges. You get the idea. It took me a minute to see all that the market has to offer. Let's not advertise this until you get about 20 vendors or so. It was a huge disappointment.~honey beef oranges. ~1
19jV_YngqOH0h40IxItUKA~sv0Z8cKcYLWrtfSs5uLQcw~The "Little Engine That Could" should offer a lesson to the Tempe Farmer's Market. Because it isn't what is claims to be. Aside from the token produce stand, the token honey stand and the token olive oil stand, this place really doesn't have a leg on which to stand. That's a shame. But, that's a college town.   When I found out this farmer's market has been existing for about four weeks, I was truly disappointed in the turnout, because a dozen vendors do not a farmer's market make. While there is a great potential for this to be a great destination, I question whether or not Tempe--downtown Tempe at that--is an appropriate location for such a market. I'll keep my judgment to myself in the meantime and continue to shop here. At least there are alternative shops abroad.~honey olive ~3
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~RO_z-jx44PIW9re1GCnWGQ~Yuck. (And I'm not one of the people comparing it to how it was in the 70s either - I am a 21 year old college student that thinks it is yuck.)  Mill Avenue is not the hype people give it. It is disgusting. It's dirty and grimy (and not just because it's old). There are homeless drug addicts everywhere you turn, that will harrass you if you don't give them change, and scare the crap out of me when I have to walk past. I will NOT walk down Mill after dark alone.   Full of wasted college kids here every weekend night of course, and it is a terrible atmosphere if you're not 21-24 looking to get hammered and lucky.  Good luck finding parking, it's all metered, expensive garages, or free 3 blocks away at Farmer and 5th, but that's usually full of students' cars.  EDIT: No more free parking, ANYWHERE! 5th and Farmer is now "Permit Only" until 6 pm. So if you want to get lunch or hit happy hour, you are SOL on parking. Gee, Mill Avenue, guess you really must not be doing well, that you have to take more and more free parking away every few months.  The stores are all corporate garbage, except for Old Town Books, Hippie Gypsy and a couple independent (at least I think) restaurants/bars. How exactly is a giant PF Changs, Urban Outfitters, and Starbucks conducive to "local flavor"? The rent in the area is outrageous, hence why the mom-and-pops can't stay in business.  And if I didn't hate Mill Avenue enough, the fact that they had a cute mom-and-pop ice cream sandwich store (Cookiez) and then allowed "Slickables", a big honking backed-by-tons-of-money store selling the EXACT SAME PRODUCT with Dreyers ice cream to move in across the street. That was just in poor taste, especially since Cookiez is now out of business.  Take your venture to Old Town Scottsdale instead - way more variety!~ice cream sandwich ~1
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~P7PZpJKJwPWlu2fOQm9zog~Best Feature: Ambiance  I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.  Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't "District" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an "arts district" a "shopping district" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the "Mill Avenue District" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.  Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).  However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.  Overall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.~cookies pizza ~3
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~C2Um0NA-RaZBQv-dIkFZiQ~Mill Avenue District is the place to be and be seen in Tempe.  The corollary is that it is a good place for people watching . . .  if you like seeing drunk college students.  Yeah, it's Tempe, and it's a college town.  Shopping, dinning, drinking, strolling, and froyo, Mill District has it all in spades.  The new family fav is Canteen.  The fam has also been known to stop in for pizza at Mellow Mushroom and La Bocca.  We've tried the foyo and bought some shoes.  The side walks are wide, the traffic slow, the decorations come out during the holidays, and the parking isn't bad if you know where to look.  Mill has a character and charm all of it own.  And who knows, it might even have a light rail station one day.~pizza mushroom ~5
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~dhDZaWHLD1XUSgTeO5dKEQ~Many date nights on Mill Ave while trying to make the most of Phoenix night life scene.  Located in Tempe and close to the University.  It's a snippet of the kind of night life I'm accustomed to.  But if you happen to find yourself in Phoenix and wondering what to do or where to go.  Start here.  There's a variety of restaurants and bars to try.  It's walkable and beats sitting in your hotel room watching t.v.  You'll be in college area territory so things can get interesting.~date ~3
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~LSxmnS4o5e_8UpqflyBp2w~I love this place.  My husband introduced me to this place.  We come down here a lot to eat, drink, dance, and walk around.  I enjoy Fuzzy's Taco Shop, Slices, Five Guys, Fat Tuesdays, Third Thursdays, Art Festivals, New Year's Eve Block Party, street performers on all the major corners, and night life.    I highly recommend coming out here for New Year's Eve Block Party, if you are 15 and up.  It's amazing.  Tons of people but didn't feel crowded at all.  Security could have been a little better.  Some teens like to light people on fire with fire crackers.  Come on peeps!  There are kids out there in the crowd.  I do not recommend bringing out your young kids to the block party even though they had a kids corner.    If you are a night owl, this is a great place to hang.  During the week, places are open late, but kinda quiet.  Weekends are packed full of music and fun.~taco ~4
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~fHxlJcqovuYTCgTBdPauJA~Too bad this Mill Ave. district reviewing isn't separated into different eras.  I preferred the pre-Millenial Ave. days, such as the early 90's right when the expansion started and it was "the place" with fresh shops that were all OPEN, and fewer of those annoying homeless people asking for money or tampons.   This was when the Coffee Plantation was locally owned, had coffee carts on campus at ASU, and the coffee was actually somewhat good.  Mill had so much traffic of people cruising that the police had crude anti-cruising measures set up to reduce the traffic.  Even though I never ate at Long Wong's and a few others that are gone, it is sad to see them not there.  No... SLICES and THE LIBRARY don't cut it for me.~coffee coffee coffee ~2
0xbfoylmBOjoKKYDwawTkw~sVoafRNVK7IDmkpBiNrWGw~Mill Avenue is an interesting place.  It reminds of a downtown area, but smaller.  This place is popular because it is within walking distance to Arizona State University and has a ton of stores.  Many artists/performers like to come here and play their instruments on the streets on certain nights (I believe often on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays).  There are so many different type of stores throughout these street that meet a variety of needs.   There is a store called "Hippie Gypsy" that has tons of unique items you would think a hippy would use, but it is overall just a fun store.  There is all kinds of ice cream places, restaurants, bars, clubs, convenient stores,  high-end clothing stores, boutiques, and even a piano bar.    For me personally, I get scared sometimes here because they are homeless  people sometimes that asks for money, but they haven't given me a problem.  I still personally would never go alone as women, but that's just my opinion.  If you are a visitor, I would hit this place because it's unique for Arizona. :)  If you want to see all the stores here, here is the link http://www.millavenue.com/directory/shopping~ice cream ~4

0JKOkyQhx53MD6MvzRPz3g~-GEyxtxnOx1k3x0I4i6vzw~I like this Subway location.  It is always clean and the staff has been consistent for quite a long time.  They are quick in preparing the sandwiches and are somewhat patient when customers don't know what they want.  You may know my pet peeve, flies, I don't recall any problems while visiting this Subway.  I highly recommend this location for a health sandwich when you're in the neighborhood.~sandwiches sandwich ~4
0JKOkyQhx53MD6MvzRPz3g~66uoNKvGqi8V-JQE7qamHw~It's Subway, so you know what to expect. However, some Subways are better than others, and this is one of the better ones. It's always clean and the owner seems to be on the ball. And they always have those chocolate chip cookies ready (not the case for every Subway.)  The only reason for the four stars opposed to five is the constant turnover for employees, which can make ordering slow at times because someone new is often being trained.   Overall, if you're looking for a clean and reliable Subway, this location should be considered.~chocolate chip cookies ~4

Try the cake batter and fluffy marshmallow flavors, they are magical ^_^ I'm so glad this place opened, I'll be back weekly for sure!!!   Ps: you must get the popping boba as a topping. Trust me.~cake ~5
9JTkh1D7u9fRBohglQRL0w~WO_AmpTgR6XkcRsFt2vyhQ~The pluses - they serve beer and have sport on screens at the bar; you'll be glad to get home.  The minuses - food is nasty (think very bad school cafeteria); wait staff we had were pretty rude; it doesn't come cheap which is actually a blessing as you are less likely to order; and if you want quick this isn't the place.  Asyou can see not the best of establishments.  I cannot see going back any time soon.~sport ~1
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~ItwCgiARkSDlAohI3_ecUg~Reincarnated from "Wok on Yonge", this restaurant has very basic decor, and a huge menu of both Thai and Chinese dishes. My favourite dish is the cold spring rolls appetizer, and I often get the mango salad and Tom Yum (thai lemongrass) soup. I've found the Thai curries vary from tasty to meh, and the Pad Thai is just okay, in my opinion. On the Chinese side, I really liked  the Crispy Ginger Beef - it reminded me of Calgary Ginger Beef, which I sometimes miss! Definitely not the healthiest choice, though.  Service also varies, though it's usually pretty good. More often, I get take-out. Prices seem average given the amount and quality of the food.~thai mango salad thai lemongrass) soup. thai thai ginger beef ~3
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~JZ_k_O_KZxJR4-A4gVTYiQ~Phuket Paradise....what can I say about this place?   Well...one thing is that it's definitely far from paradise..hahaha...It's a pretty basic place...looks like it's from the 90's.  For the lack of Thai restaurants in Richmond Hill I have been to this place several times...sometimes to pick up take out and sometimes for lunch.   Some dishes like their cold spring rolls are pretty awesome and the tom yum soup is good. However I'm not really crazy about anything else in that place. Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay... too much sauce or weird sauce flavour....I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish.   Bottom line...I don't think I will be back...unless I get an order of take out of their cold spring rolls...They are pretty awesome , like I have mentioned! ;)   The service is fast and good...nothing special.~thai soup thai ~3
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~1l_SDxgjpEPGYTJn_gLXDw~2.5 Star   If I going to rate Phuket Paradise based on their Chicken Pad Thai, It would deserved a 1 star...   Lunch Special from $6.99 with soup or spring roll. The selections are quite good with both Chinese and Thai fares... Maybe that is NOT a good sign? If a Thai restaurant serving chow mein..??   Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy. The Tom Yum is on the sour side, but my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that.   Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness, but I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish.   Pad Thai... stay away from Pad Thai.... the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup. But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok!   Deco is nice but the whole restaurant smelled like bleach. But maybe I should feel assured that they scrubbed the floor really clean??!~chicken thai, soup thai thai chow mein.. coconut soup soup coconut soup chicken white thai... thai.... tamarind ~2
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~NYFKAFGalNx3Hm5mWsLSBg~The possibility of puns shined bright in my head, but I restrained myself.  Paradise, it ain't, but I went to Phuket, and I liked it.  The place is very non-descript. It is clean, welcoming and bright. The menu is primarily Thai, but they also feature a large number of Chinese dishes.  I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.  As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls. The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat. They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps. I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer.  As mains we ordered a Green Curry with heef and a Seafood and chicken Pad Thai, with a bowl of steamed rice. The Pad Thai was authentic and good, with a good amount of tamarind to arrive at the right taste and colour. The Green Curry was delicious, with an ample serving of delicious and tender slices of beef. This was a 4 star dish.  We drank Jasmine tea with our meal. Overall the food was good, the portions large and the vibe OK. At $52 before HST it was a bit pricey.This maybe due to the fact that we were charged for 2 teas.~thai, thai coconut soup. thai lemon shrimps. chicken thai, thai tamarind beef. jasmine tea ~3
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~xH2k7WVr3mCVsZMkEd0GSA~Amazing value for afternoon lunch that can't be beat. Huge portions that include either a spring roll or a soup. Surprising the coconut chicken soup was really great and definitely made for a good appetizer. If your looking to get the best bang for your buck in thornhill, this place is it.~soup. coconut chicken soup ~4
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~T98Sm3irFkapM39id9wYNg~2.5 stars.   It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.  We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.  Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.  Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots.   Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.  Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.  Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again.~thai thai chicken thai chicken ~2
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~TYYuDBWVHkmjHwSNHybHlA~My favorites: coconut soup, green curry shrimp, ice tea latte thing they make, and mango salad.  Big portions!~coconut soup, shrimp, tea mango salad. ~4
DaYA84gx1p7TvtsW14NuAw~WoCuHnriizJNHB7XwQfU8g~I like this place. The food is decent enough, service is not so bad considering it never gets that full (that fact should tell me something) The only reason I come here is because they have a chicken version of szechuan szechuan's crispy ginger beef which I really like. This has to be the only reason I visit.  I've had several other dishes such as pad thai, mango salad, green curry beef and each one has been pretty average. Not great but not bad. Come to think of it, I'd give a 2 for most dishes~chicken ginger beef ~3

My girlfriend got me a full set by Jessica for Christmas and even made my appointment for me. I went to see Jessica and after asking some questions she did the necessary removal of my old lashes and put on my new set! All I can say about them is, wow what a difference! They are full, thick and long! I absolutely love them and she is my new regular lash girl!! Thank you, Jessica!!~cherry ~5
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~qXcOgRzitwybqbljRgF_VA~Allgemein Also ich nur das Beste über dieses Restaurant sagen. Die Pizza Ruccola war wohl die Beste die ich bis jetzt gegessen habe, und auch die Größte. Bedienung waren an dem Abend der Chef und ein Angestellter, beide sehr nett und aufmerksam. Ging alles sehr zügig und professionell. Ich kann das Restaurant nur weiterempfehlen und 5***** geben. Danke nochmal für den schönen Abend und Gruß aus Bielefeld Bernd H. P.S.: Herrn Grube kann ich nicht verstehen Bedienung Bedienung sehr aufmerksam. Trotz das das Restaurant gut besucht war haben die zwei Bedienungen es ohne Probleme geschafft Das Essen Pizza Ruccola, mit italienischen Schinken und gehobeltem Parmesankäse. Die Pizza war größer als der Pizzateller, super !!! Das Ambiente Gemütlich Italienisch, absolut OK. Der hintere Bereich war frisch renoviert und modern. Man hat also die Wahl Sauberkeit Alles sauber und ordentlich, auch die Toiletten~pizza pizza pizza ~5
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~Qlq3Rz67Z8kI35uG8aKH5w~I dined here with a group of friends for a Valentine's dinner.  We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari. The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto. The steak was covered in gravy sauce, but the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture.  "Dinner for two", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72€, plus my voluntary tip. I probably wouldn't have tipped if I knew what was about to happen. (I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply.) We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order. It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it. During the meal, we were pleased and everyone thought it was a good place for special dinners, but after the problem with the check, we all changed our minds.  The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor.  He's right, but we're also not stupid. What an insult. So from a 4.5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star. (Only a sincere apology from the owner to our group would change my rating to 4.)~steak, salad, steak steak ~3
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~Mf42SbOXU1HpJI6-b8PKXA~Haben uns zu diesem Restaurant gegoogled und sind auf Grund der Bewertungen zu diesem Lokal gegangen. Bedienung war sehr langsam und nicht kompetent. Essen hat sehr lange gedauert, war gut angerichtet. Leider waren 2 Pizzen kalt und mussten nochmals in die Kueche. Bei einem Gericht waren die Teigtaschen zu "a; dente", hatte ich bisher auch noch nicht. Lasagne war geschmacklich gut aber sehr kleine Portion. In Summe war es sehr enttauschend und ich weiss nicht ob der Koch oder die ganze Mannschaft schon im Weihnachtsurlaub waren.~lasagne ~2
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~MZNkVIuehT39yrXpL-td6A~"Ich habe die Lokalität bisher viermal besucht und war noch nie zufrieden. Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gefälligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen läßt. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung veröffentlich haben. Doch der Reihe nach: 1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und Küche total überfordert. Getränke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren über 3 Stunden vergangen. Während sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergnügte, saßen andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angekündigt, daß wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen. 2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gaststätte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht übermäßig üppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr häufig beschrieben wurde, die familiäre Atmosphäre des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten Gästen an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getränke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, daß seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet. 3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gefüllt und wir saßen auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getränkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getränke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, daß nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:"Eigentlich hätte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar Stücken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut.". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, daß niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (natürlich auf Rechnung). Die anschließenden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren natürlich brühwarm und der Getränkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen Gäste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mußten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir übrigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gläser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen "dezenten" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild. 4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gaststätte mittelprächtig gefüllt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben könnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht möglich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am "Berliner Platz", wo wir anschließend hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile kürzerer Zeit kein Problem. Fazit: Obwohl es nur 100 Meter zu fuß sind, nie wieder "La romantica"!!!!"~pizza pizza ~2
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~zyiMOTj20nWrtjdUC-3ieg~Allgemein In einen Wohngebiet im Sindelfinger Westen liegt der bekannte Italiener "La Romantica". Die Ambiente ist südländisch und man kommt sich vor auf der terasse vor, als wäre man in den Ferien am Gardasee. Bedienung Wir waren die ersten Gäste an diesen Abend, aber der Kellner war höflich und kompetent. Es gab keine Empfehlungen aber die Speisen und die Getränke kamen nach kurzer Wartezeit.  Das Essen Da es keine Empfehlungen vom Haus gab, haben wir die sehr umfangreiche Standardkarte eines Italiener vorgenommen. Es wurde geessen: 1x Meeresfrüchtesalat,  1 Spaghetti Carbonara, 1x Saltimbocca Romana, 1x Scaloppine pizzaliola, Dazu Mineralwasser, Pinot Grigio und Chianti. Das Essen war außer dem Meeresfrüchtesalat lecker aber nicht sehr viel. Das Ambiente Die Ambiente ist in dieJahre gekommenund bräuchte eine Renovierung. Sauberkeit Sauberkeit ist I. O. Die Toiletten wurden nicht besucht.~spaghetti carbonara, ~3
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~46mLOwrt2ir1SENRtuR3Xw~My waiter was great!  The food was outstanding and they have Bitburger on tap. From the salad to the entree, this place has it together. I was visiting Patch and this place was recommended by a lady at the Marriott. On both nights I went the waiter, one was hot, gave me great service and no issues with my bill. They use the correct amount of arugula in their dishes, which is hard to do. Super! I'll be back when I come to Sindelfingen.~salad arugula ~4
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~47FkIQdeByCS2ui4iBn2qA~Allgemein Esse gerne und oft, überall auf der Welt! Das La Romantica begeistert mit der Frische, insbesondere der selber gemachten Nudeln. Die meisten haben "frisch" gekaufte Nudeln aus der Packung. Gemüse war knackig, die Idee des Baybspinatsalates kreativ. Pizza , suchtgefahr wie beim Pizzabrot welches kostenlos gereicht wird. Für die Umgebung(Arbeiterstadt) gutes bis sehr gutes Preis/Leistungverhältnis. Weinauswahl sehr gut und die Preise sehr Human. Unserer Kostet in einem StuttgarterRestaurant 30% mehr. Gehen sicherlich mal wieder hin! Bedienung Wir waren Mittagessen und haben dieses Restaurant nun zum 3 mal aufgesucht. Die Bedienungen waren jedesmal unterschiedliche Personen, jedoch Zackig und freundlich. Das Essen Babyspinat Salat mit Avocado.... Alle 4 Daumen hoch. 2x  Nudeln mit Gemüse(vegetarisch) klasse. Pizza sehr üppig und wurde teilweise mitgenommen.Fleisch well done , wie bestellt und sehr weich im Schnitt und Biss. Nachtisch , Testaktion, ohne Worte lecker! Das Ambiente Teilweise wurde zum letzten mal renoviert und dieser Raum sieht sehr Einladend aus. Der Rest sieht eher alt aus und sollte getauscht werden.Wahrscheinlich desewegn der "Schmudellige" Eindruck der keiner ist. Toiletten sauber! Sauberkeit Keine Beanstandungen!~pizza avocado.... pizza ~4
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~bj0ZrL2V2FTvGSrhky06-g~Aufmerksam geworden durch eine sehr positive Bewertung des Restaurants in diesem Portal, die insbesondere auf das dort bewertete Candle-Light-Dinner hinwies, entschloss ich mich meine Freundin ebenfalls mit einem solchen Dinner anlässlich eines besonderen Ereignisses zu überraschen. Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, klärten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge für unser Menü und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er würde uns mit einem köstlichen Fünf-Gänge-Menü überraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung. Als wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenblättern, einem Rosenstrauß und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch. Der äußerst freundliche Kellner begrüßte uns und führte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der Küche, begrüßte uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erläuterte uns mit welchen Genüssen er uns nun zu verwöhnen gedachte. Die Speisenfolge die er für uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende: 1. Lachstranchen auf Weißbrot mit gedünsteten Gemüsestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gefüllt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an würziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel Dazu empfahl er uns als Getränk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten. Die Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualität und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativität und Hingabe zubereitet worden. Die Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren köstlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu großzügig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollständig verzehren. Das äußerst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte dafür dass immer die Gläser mit Wein (der natürlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gefüllt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zusätzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden dürfe. Die absolute Krönung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem köstlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der Küche sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverständlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot. Vorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten dürfe. Kurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk überreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich dafür bedankte, dass wir seine Gäste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben. Der absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erwähnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen müsse und meinen Wagen dann eben am nächsten Morgen irgendwie abholen müsse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, natürlich nur wenn es uns recht wäre, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so daß er wieder zurück kommen würde. Wir haben das tatsächlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und Mädels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden! Eines ist sicher, wann immer wir künftig in der Nähe sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begrüßt und verwöhnt werden! Fazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss für jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit! Übrigens, es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis für diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getränken usw. mit rund 100€ auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.~vitello scampi- ~5

1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~Zn3n46yZ8nf5VsjQIMzdpw~Das Restaurant liegt zu Füßen des Wasserturms auf dem Goldberg in Sindelfingen. Wir wurden sehr freundlich begrüßt und an unseren Tisch geführt. Der Gastraum ist zweigeteilt und es gibt eine große Terrasse. Der Gastraum ist wenig einladend, dafür war der Service umso besser. Lediglich die weißen Handschuhe beim Servieren waren dem allg. Niveau nicht angemessen. Eher Pizzeria als Gourmet Italiener. Die Pizzen die wir gesehen haben waren RIESIG!!!  Die Speisen (Tomatensuppe, Antipasti, Pasta) waren sehr schön angerichtet und lecker. Der Vorspeisenteller war mir pers. zu "wurst-lastig" und zu wenig Selbstgemachtes. Die Pasta von der Tageskarte war sehr lecker.~pasta) pasta ~4
1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q~cHEM9Jy03WVLK8IBB0tG8w~Allgemein An sich ein schönes Lokal. Wir waren die einzigen Gäste. Macht einen leicht schmuddeligen Eindruck.. Sollte dringend Grossputz gemacht werden - damit das ganze wieder einladend wirkt. Ich bewerte selten - möchte damit den Besitzern helfen das Ganze wieder in den Griff zu kriegen.  Bedienung war flink und freundlich.. Allerdings denke ich er ist sich bewusst dass es nicht perfekt ist - wir wurden zB nicht gefragt ob es geschmeckt hat Bedienung Sehr flink und freundlich. Essen wurde zügig serviert - sonst gibt es dazu nicht viel zu sagen Das Essen Pasta gut.. Pizza ist riesig. Geschmacklich allerdings hatte ich schon bessere Pizzen. Vorspeise Tomate mit Mozzarella  für 7,50 konnte ich nicht fertig essen - der Käse war zu weich !! Richtig unangenehm beim Essen.. Wahrscheinlich zu lange gelagert. Das Ambiente Eingedeckte Tische sauber und ordentlich - Boden, Fenster brauchen Reinigung. Alle Tische auf der an sich schönen Terrasse sind nicht sauber - macht einen sehr schlechten ersten Eindruck. Sauberkeit Frühjahrsputz nötig: Fenster - Boden vor der Theke, Fensterbänke und Gartenmöbel~pasta pizza mozzarella ~2

I was just involved in a conference at which many of the attendees might have perished in the Canada wind if it weren't for Subway. I had a veggie sandwich, which was delicious and life-affirming, considering the circumstances.   Thanks, Subway!~sandwich, ~4
2TP8uQkMDo7Av5ATNJtI9Q~W5zLIR52Mooe8WN_OxU1hw~Yes. 4 stars for a Subway. Why? First of all, it's in close proximity to the Toronto Airport hotels. Secondly, and probably the most important, it's 24 hours. This is huge for late night eaters who don't want to wander all over Toronto to get a meal.  The place itself was really no different than any other Subway I've been to. The service was prompt, friendly and accurate. What more can you ask for in fast food? I was very satisfied.   The Indian gentleman that crafted my sandwich added a certain ingredient that made the sandwich wonderful and unforgettable--yes my friends--LOVE.~sandwich sandwich ~4
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~wZcut40vGTumt2Q2_wAmwQ~I went there yesterday after buying a "Now" deal via Groupon. I got $20 groupon for $10. I went with three kids and found that the groupon is not worth buying UNLESS its just two people going. For example, the groupon is not valid for their "kids eat for 99 cents with each paying adult". Not to mention the food is over priced for the quality as well! Also, the have All-you-can-eat fish Fridays for roughly $10 but we couldn't get this because we had a groupon. The waitresses there are VERY rude. I told her I was waiting for the groupon to load and it would only be a second be cause we were not expecting to come and her response was "so do you want a seat or what?" the place was not that busy for her to be so rude...anyhow, I never complained and eventually after being sitted the waiters kept walking by like we didn't exist until the supervisor (I believed him to be) came over and took our order and he was nice. The environment and the way they treat their customers is rude over all and I've been there 3 times over the last 2 years. The fried pickles were barely battered this time so my kids didn't enjoy them as much.....Oh and don't ask the wrong person for help because they will tell you that they are not in charge of your table and will walk away.~fried pickles ~1

6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~tWLmsyKZLy7MXC7EFdckeA~Visited today with two grandchildren, ages 2 and 7. Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.  Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too.   Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), "We don't combine cards!" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.  Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food.~fries cheese brown & cheese bacon butter sausage pancakes french toast coffee ~2
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~jyY0IR4cRI56gtO5NGbf7Q~Garbage! This place was not "Classic 50's style" at all! The burgers were so dry and flavorless, I'm amazed people still would even go here, you might as well go to Carl's Jr, Wendy's, or Jack in the Box instead of this place! Don't waste your time or your money. If you want good classic 50's style restaurant go to Chase's Diner in Chandler waaay better!~burgers ~1
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~6YkFJIuduVyI-0s1wqScYw~Woohoo! This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!!   The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff.   Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner.   So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please.   The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere.   The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.    I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.~fries fries sandwich sandwich, macaroni and cheese ~4
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~i88YnHNurBuHT0WfYMzS_Q~The decor is great. There are little jukeboxes at every table. The service is good. But the menu is a little too Denny's-like for my taste. There is a good selection of burgers and breakfast items, but nothing terribly unique or too reminisent of a 50's style diner. A bit pricey too. Overall I was pretty disappointed.~burgers ~3
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~Io7FgFkJMDinURH-BOaWAg~When I visit Phoenix, this is the best place for burgers and fries.  They do some unique soda flavors.  I love their Vanilla-Cherry Coke.  Breakfast is good too, but I am not much of a breakfast person.~burgers fries. cherry coke. ~5
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~f3ejqJ83dgqOVw45cngnbg~This place was awesome - Val our waitress was super nice and very helpful.  Place is a cool looking diner with a MASSIVE menu, was all most too hard to decide what to eat.  I had a reuben and the kids both had pancakes (mickey mouse shaped - so cute) - the best though was my husband's a double burger - I can't remember when we had anything so good, yes - I had to eat some of it!!~pancakes ( burger - ~4
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~95WYXLTVaFUnNTqZXBZZJA~Incredibly polite and efficient service.  Plus, no wait on a Sunday afternoon, which is the exact opposite of, say, IHOP.  We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.  I hope not, because I definitely will return.~salsa salsa chicken fried steak ~4
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~zLVppC-bmR8BdEDYkhvoiA~Salads are very iceberg-heavy.  Not bad, just old-fashioned.  Nothing remarkable.  My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen.  Chicken Pot Pie ( "NEW" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.  French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.  Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.  I only went there because I had a BOGO entree' coupon.  Not worth it at all.  P.S.  I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars.~salads iceberg- lettuce chicken pie ( french fries ~2
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~QRIFsMi7CFr1c4leraMxNw~My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner. I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.  Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife "do you like bacon or sausage", to which she replied "bacon". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said "the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine.~sandwich raisin sandwich bacon sausage" bacon" sandwich bacon bacon. sandwich bacon, ~2
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~tfITstL4oNokLtqf8vccSA~5 & Diner.  Why do I keep coming here?  No, seriously.  Why?  Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.  The food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.    I somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.    Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.  Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... "this does not even taste like carrots."  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.    Cherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.  Still, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.    But if I ever remember that the food is blah, I will avoid this place.  I just don't ever seem to remember it until I am sitting there eating it!~pie salad cake pie. carrot cake? carrot cake cake cherry pie? pie cherry pie ~3
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~s4q9s0wYJ46JWF1AGIwCyg~Nothing special here.  This time I just went for dessert and ordered an Oreo shake.  It's kind of hard to mess that up so I can't complain.  It is a large shake though I'll say that.  Service was fine, and it definitely has the 50s diner atmosphere.  They even have mini juke boxes at each table and you can pick a song for a quarter I think.  Tip: If you are looking for a late eat besides the 24-hour Mexican joint, this may work.  Open until 10 Sun-Thu, and until 11:30 Fri-Sat.  Or, the one on 16th St in Phoenix is open 24 hrs.~oreo ~3
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~gogb-wAoEpeknacaSmamhw~I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions. However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.  We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.  My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.  M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.  Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well.~bacon cheese bacon chicken burger cheese burger lettuce. fries. chicken fingers fries, corn ~1
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~pcZzSdJGBoaxlSH3js8NLg~We love the feel and the food of a genuine 50's diner. My wife and I went to this one last night. It was just okay. Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.~burgers fries fries cheese tomato ~2
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~4QeR7dNfX0HHjObxozwMZA~Breakfast. Go for Breakfast! -choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy.  It's $6.75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate. However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh. Everything home-style. There's no way you'll finish it or find a place that tops.  ...service and coffee is great too.~egg coffee ~5
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~DvpKzyAVu6k_iW8e-pCiDQ~I've been here a LOT. I live down the road.   To start...the food here is pretty much all good. The only thing I would suggest avoiding is the nachos. They load them up but so much the chips turn soggy real quick. However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious.  The staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice.   The restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.  As for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them.   Over all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus.~nachos. chips fried pickles ~5
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~JpSIs4a_ZcMdfc_t8kibXg~This is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots in the Valley, and I am surprised by many of the negative reviews it has received. They serve great breakfast burritos and pancakes, and a wide variety of omelets. Their coffee is good enough. For lunch, they offer a wide variety of excellent sandwiches. Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans: 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs. My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries. Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce. This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal. This location, set outside of Tempe's Arizona Mills, is my favorite location.~burritos pancakes, coffee sandwiches. beef hot dogs. burger, cheese, french fries ~5
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~yB3vtTE2W3LCXBRmhLaGgQ~My boyfriend and I stopped in to 5 & Diner after he picked me up at the airport and I was starving for some breakfast. They had all your diner favorites and it looked like they served the entire menu, even at 10 AM. I forgot the exact name of my dish, but it was bacon and eggs with biscuits and gravy. MMMM all of my favorite foods on a plate. The bf had the same, but with a chocolate milkshake! I hate boys and their fast metabolisms. The biscuits were nice and fluffy, but the bacon could have been a bit crispier.  It's a nice Denny's/IHOP alternative. Good, quick service, but it was fairly empty at 10 AM on a Wednesday.~bacon milkshake! bacon ~3
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~jdc0IbfFmFhsXmMDR_klVA~Went here for dinner using a Groupon. We were sat right away and drinks came soon after. Then we waited. And waited. Several employees walked by, each time seeming to look the other way. As if to say,"You're not my table".  Finally a guy came over (may have been the manager) and said,"what can I get you?" That's it. No "Hi" or "are you ready to order?". I was a little turned off at that point. I would've left since I was already annoyed at how long we were ignored for (I've done that before, you can tell when you're about to get crappy service) but the kids were "starving".  Anywho, my patty melt was ok. I've had better. Fries were pretty good.  Service continued to suck. Needless to say I won't be back. My family likes to eat out as a treat once/twice a week. When we find a place that has great food AND great service, we come back. That's where I'll spend my hard earned money. Not at 5 & Diner.~patty fries ~2
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~DQrKJzKKr1InYmnuqM-bJg~Came here this morning  because I had a meeting in the area so I stopped in for some breakfast.  I have not been to a 5 & Diner since my single days of stopping in at 1am....back when bars closed at 1am.  Anyway, I order the breakfast special for $4.99 which is basically bacon and eggs and it was great, the hash browns were brown and crispy, eggs cooked perfect, bacon crispy, and the toast was like what I used to eat when i was a kid...the small bread.  Yep, i was pleased and the service was fantastic.  The atmosphere and decor is very casual and its 50's style with the music and all.  I am not a fan of Mill's mall but this place worked out nice this morning.~bacon brown bacon ~4
6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA~VUAwquKwz69H8zbXtn8q6g~My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.    As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.~fries patty waffle steak coke. coke waffle patty ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~35g0Lz41L7jv5eAyUz3d6g~First time here. Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter.  Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.  Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.  Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.  So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.~date ceviche ( shrimp, potato chips ceviche lime taco tuna ceviche date, ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~uzFivWA7fgURB38Ld8O0wg~I went for happy hour (5-7pm) on a Sunday Night. The sugarcane sangria is delicious($5 on happy hour). The original Mojito on the other hand was not! I had the habanero pepper jack and cheese, it was VERY SMALL and tasted not too much different than Kraft Mac&Cheese. I heard a lot about "TRUFFLE CHIPS" but all I could taste was the truffle oil. The ceviche was okay but overpriced. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and the patio is great as it looks over townsquare park. I would possibly go back for sangria but nothing else... Definitely not a place to enjoy a nice meal or even some appetizers with a drink.~habanero cheese, chips" ceviche appetizers ~1
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~Ck6O0cRtKLR6wTG32MwtHA~A nice location sandwiched between Bar Louie and Blue Martini at Town Square. I have to say that this should be "the" spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish décor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot.  However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand.   What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.  The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.~mushroom ceviche bacon ( bacon ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~yTFgTpbsM5vUMmzhoEfBng~I love Cana's mojitos which are muddled with fresh fruit and real sugar cane. I've also tried the caparinha which is also really good. Every time my friends and I come here, we either get the empanadas, beef tenderloin, slider dogs, classico ceviche, tuna ceviche, or the fish tacos.  Happy Hour prices are amazing. You can eat pretty well for fairly cheap. The service has ALWAYS been excellent here.~beef ceviche, tuna ceviche, tacos. ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~bFyH1m7fgYPCvq8yxPAbfA~My review is a little late coming but I really enjoyed Happy Hour when I was in Las Vegas for the final days of my campaign.  My work colleague and i decided to try Cana because of the 1/2 off mojitos.  I probably could have drank like 10 of them.  I tried the strawberry, original, cucumber mojitos.  DELICIOUS!  I had two strawberry. The small plates were also delectable.  Each had their own personality.  And we even ordered the churros for desert.   The waitress was awesome and one of the chefs even dropped by.  If I ever go back to vegas, I will definitely hit it up again.~cucumber ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~M02txxaoA6YTRK7f5QPohw~I'm surprised this place is getting such great ratings. They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible.   This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time.   When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food.   The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab.   Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent.   I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor.   I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.~ceviche ceviche salmon... chorizo corn salmon, ceviche. tuna ceviche. salad. salad. greens. ~1
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~DaD9JQvurWdjMKTq5h4eMw~A friend and I went to dinner here, and while the experience was brief, and the conversation was enjoyable and longer than the meal, I had a good time.  I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their "Fire Water" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.  I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.  Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again.~beef ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~6Q8FhcQQesh8if8IdPKF1A~It was my first time trying ceviche so, it could be like Beatles, Sgt Peppers being your first album.  But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your "foodie" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said "I wish I could try 5 plates".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.  If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?)   - Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish "cooked" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?)   Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop.   Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender.   Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have.   - Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. "Not as sweet" as most.   Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult.   I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square.   Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason.   I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, "I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it. I was asking locals at the malls if they had been. I'll wait for Cana NYC to open up.~ceviche ceviche ceviche, cheese shrimp ribs ceviche - hot peppers shrimp shrimp ( ribs -- guava bacon almond white chicken corn chorizo. mac and cheese ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~YB59O-pcCNSUU7s89FuOHQ~3.5 stars.    Both my wife and I wanted a small dinner and this was a perfect place to do it.  Went with the hirame ceviche which was was done w/ lavender, lychee and lime.  Interesting mix for a ceviche and tasty but I just prefer the regular stuff.  We also ordered the beef empanadas and the cuban sliders which were both very good.    While the menu was fine, my wife kinda wished there was a larger selection of stuff but it wasn't that big a deal.    Atmosphere is awesome.  Great place for drinks and this place is gonna rock when the weather gets warmer.~ceviche lychee lime. ceviche beef ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~NDWmzZLRoFUo87U1I465mA~Really wanted this to be a great place.Sure looks good inside & I have to say the service was great. However I found the food way over priced and the portions small (Yeah I know Tapas are small plates) but from $12-$14 give me some meat. Drinks were tasty & I enjoyed the white sangria over the red but again pricey. Nothing really blew my top which is sad and I don't think I will be back I'm sorry to say. Lower your price or increase the portion size. I'm not cheap by any means.~white ~2
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~KwYQNiCIn0s4IDySMadjcg~We stopped in on a Saturday night after seeing the sign.  We were going to grab some sushi but hadn't noticed Caña before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas.  Lots of small plates meant to be shared.  We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks.  Drinks were great.  Food was excellent.  However, the ceviche isn't really ceviche if that's what you're looking for.  The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing.  Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.  Service is good.  Definitely a good place for groups.  It's rather noisy so be warned.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios.~sushi salad, meatballs, ceviche, ceviche, tuna ceviche ceviche salad ceviche ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~NmqKBjxnonZ8m-9EXMXlow~Went here on a Friday night- very nice vibe, sangria and mojito were yummy (should've listened to our waitress and got a pitcher for $28 since we ended up ordering that much in drinks anyways!)  We liked the decor and feel of the restaurant- made us kinda feel like we were back home in SF at the XYZ Bar at the W Hotel.  We ordered beef tenderloin, lamb chops, mac n cheese and halibut ceviche.  The beef tenderloin was good, portion was fine for the two of us.  The mac n cheese was REALLY good.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and great flavor.  The ceviche was fresh and came with a shot glass of sauce that you can put the halibut in or on.  Overall, service was good we would come back for happy hour next time since we ended up spending a little over $100 for two...~beef lamb cheese ceviche. beef cheese lamb ceviche ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~_SOxX5KhLB87ljcVUcsNHw~My new favorite bar /hangout spot in the city of Las Vegas ! I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:  *Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.  *Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly  *Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise.   --------------------------  I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.  We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.  On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce.   If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .~ceviche. ceviche ceviche beef mac and cheese ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~3VlDGBo7DezdHYjFi2WENw~Happy Hour: Daily 5-7PM, 12-2am 26 items $5 or less (food and drink)  The Peach Sangria was great, my girflriend immediately tried to recreate it at home.  There are many different type of ceviche here, which are a bit different than ceviche I've had in the past (closer to sashimi), but really good.  I think I had the Miso one.  In my previous review I had mentioned that they good, but a bit too expensive. I also suggested that they needed a happy hour.  Well, the owner messaged me on here to let me know that they have one now, with 26 items $5 or less.  With $5 plates, it definitely puts it into my price range, and I plan on coming back.~peach ceviche ceviche miso ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~x_ilr7pNgD-1LC97-C2ZRg~6 of us came out here tonight, a Monday night for happy hour, and we were happy.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.  These are the tapas we ordered: -Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.  -Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum  -Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.  -Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.  -Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.  -Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.  -Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.  -Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.  -Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.  -Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.  -Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.  Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.    Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.    Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...  So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.  I will come back!~cheese beef beef tuna ceviche- pork, sandwiches shrimp- honey shrimp, shrimps taco- chicken taco. cabbage taco- taco. cabbage jalapeno chicken taco. taco- honey ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~RvROB5UtlKfXMNeXD69pYg~went to cana for happy hour and they had some really good specials, $5 mojitos and beers. the mojito was EXCELLENT. we also got the mac-n-cheese with habanero seasoning, nice size portion, and it was very good. the ceviche was really good also but small portions for the price, we got the trio ceviche spicy tuna (great taste), scallop (with mango and pomegranate seeds), and the mixit (shrimp & octopus) they were each like 2 - 3 bites and it was like $30 bucks, not worth it for the price!!!if you like sangria they have a special sugar sangria that is SPECTACULAR!!!!!! will definitely go back. also a mix crowd, all ages and groups will feel at home!!~cheese habanero ceviche ceviche tuna ( mango pomegranate shrimp & ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~csyC98y6caBIwx-ZEGPeOA~Last night was my second time trying Cana, and quite frankly its not worth the money. My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center... no sauce, no flavor. This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money.  The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us.  But, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads.  Seriously, go to Firefly if you want tapas, this place is only good for drinks.~pita cheese pasta, breads, salads. ~2
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~cevDP47z9en_gqjqnuXJwQ~Nice, vibrant environment.  The server was very friendly in telling us what we should try and most were accurate.   Everyone raves about the pork sliders, but we found them to be very dry...needed a little more mustard or BBQ sauce in my opinion (cough cough...another drink please!). Maybe that was their intent...  Drinks were great as she made sure we never ran dry.    Only bizzare area was going to the bathrooms.  There was a 16 year old texting on his phone when I entered the omni-sexual configured bathroom.  Felt strange, like he was supposed to be my wiper. Bizzare.  Overall, great place!~pork ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~rhWt49Hndz-Cf-rmgOaZJw~This spot is not right down in the Strip... My guess it will be more locals, and shoppers as the restaurant is located in the very nice Town Square (http://www.townsquarelasvegas.com/)  About the Restaurant: Mojitos... Great. Tapa style plates.... Great. I tried:  The Ceviche: Lychee/lime/lavender The flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blanco The Mac & Cheese: with Habaner jace (my favorite) The Lamb Chops: with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite) Tried two of the three desserts: Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam... was not a fan of the foam...  Service was outstanding, this was the second night they were open... so i hope they keep this up. Very friendly.   Atmosphere was nice/modern/chic, I could use a brighter candle on the table... i had to use my iphone for light to read the menu... but they noticed right away, and said they would be working on it.~ceviche: pizza cheese: lamb desserts: ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~MSWz3pDdI5ueWOSfo_cvsg~I'm not sure if I'd give this place 4 stars or 3 stars. I really wish we could do 1/2 stars.   Went here for DINNER last night with some friends.   Ambiance:  low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling   Menu:  2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food  What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based   Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items  - out of all but 2 wines  - out of 2 of the 8 beers  - out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember   Taste:  Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation.  Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples.   Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp   Dessert:  WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :)  We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea!   Service:  Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10  The hostess was ... I guess... I'd say indifferent... she wasn't mean but she wasn't friendly either so....   Drinks:  I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange.   The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful.   All in all... we'll go back... it's different from the norm and I want to try their Red Sangria.~tacos tuna ceviche... chicken chicken tacos... tacos... shrimp banana white ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~1i-bOGdh557UUuCrpSUr-w~The hamachi ceviche is my favorite. The dates with goat cheese mousse were awesome too, along with the sangria. Wow. Best sangria I have ever had. We asked for the dates sans bacon and they were delicious--crisp and perfectly baked. Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain).  The best part about my experience was the service. John is an amazing bar tender. All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks. John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person.  I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.  I can't wait to go here when the weather gets nice too--large windows open up to the bar--it's a great indoor/outdoor space. Even though it was rainy and cold this Saturday, it was a fun place to be.~ceviche cheese bacon bacon ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~a5k0UtbZUjyrfsuJke06zw~overpriced tapas.  Compared to Firefly they can't hold a candle to it.  The only redeeming food they have is the mushroom ceviche.  That was delicious but, so itty bitty for $8.  If the happy hour is cheap I'll go check it out and give them a star if it's a good deal.  Remember, we are in a recession.~mushroom ceviche. ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~6C6CaEz2VM1YISRtvw-TEw~We hit this place really late, sometime after 11PM.  Prior to that, we were at the Blue Martini, so this place was a real nice break from speakers that 'go to eleven'...  Not a lot of people here but it's only been open a few weeks; hopefully that changes.  The bartender's were great!  Awesome mojitos and really great food.  We had the chicken skewers, meatballs and churros.  Everything was really flavorful and unique.  The bartenders were extremely nice and friendly.  I wish I remembered her name but she was gorgeous!  A really nice break from the usual 'Strip' stuff.~chicken meatballs ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~0_1W4WlL6-Cm1nU_zdoZ4w~Since we had time to kill before a flick we decided to eat here.  After all, tapas is a nice way to eat lots without feeling like a pig.  We ordered a plethora of dishes, and I have to say that this place is pretty good, but not great.  The only thing I really loved were their short rib tacos, but the meat was overpowered by some serious guava jelly.  if they just held back a bit on the jelly, that dish would bump my review up to a 4 star.  I did break a glass on my way out, but they were nice about it.  I can't say much about this place because the dishes were pretty but not memorable, with the exception of their short rib taco.    Would I go back?  Maybe.  I'll give it 6 months.~tacos, guava taco. ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~L4zuhfBY4wXIS79vyb-fgg~Recently got to try this place out. I always end up comparing Tapas restraunts to Firefly because Firefly is so good and I love going there. For example, when I went to Johnny Smalls in the Hard Rock it was a huge dissapointment. So much more expensive and not half as good as Firefly. SO when I sat down at Cana I thougt I would end up dissapointed again..it was the complete opposite of a let down. I loooved this place and it was not as annoyingly busy and loud as Firefly.   We got spicy tune ceviche..amazing especially with the chip thingys they bring out with it, beef emenadas..the crust is super flaky and yummy, mac n cheese..SO good and surprisingly spicy, and the meatballs. Oh, and of course, a pitcher of Sangria..the red one. Our waiter even gave us a sample of the white sangria which was also good but we were all more into the red. I can't wait to go back here and try some more things on their menu!~ceviche.. beef cheese.. meatballs. white ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~XxLiJtUUhzgFRB5uzBFmAg~Just received a nice message from Cana management:  "I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for taking the time to write a review of my restaurant, Caña.  I really appreciate it and I hope to see you in Caña again soon.  Please introduce yourself so I may say hi.  Regards,  Cory"   I replied that there were some request for new / additional drinks...      Since Cana uses Rum and Sugar Cane in the majority of their drinks,      why not add some Polynesian drinks? A Mai-Tai made with Sugar      Cane as sweetener would sound deliciouso right about now!      One of the best Iced Teas I've ever had was at a restaurant in      Sacramento where the Iced Tea (not the Long Island kind) was made     with Sugar Caner.  Man... that sounds good in the Summertime in      Vegas!~tea ( ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~Kfrir3t8vg3wC_E6B9MzPg~I recently revisited Cana and I'm glad I gave them a second chance.  I was very impressed with the waiter and the owner who were so welcoming and impressive with telling of what they enjoyed and the care that went into food preparation.  I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:  Hamachi - fresh and zesty Duck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to bite Mac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lips Calamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavor Pork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavor Bread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectations Churros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.  My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.  Overall it was a great experience, nice ambiance, great service, and a welcome spot for friends, dates, and even business dinners.~butter cheese - pork white ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~sfYmS5UAtqh61qQup5QqXw~Cana has some tasty food, but it is expensive.  Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):  Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half. Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people. Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price. Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share. Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night. Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.  During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.~beef beef cheese, cheese, white cheese, cheese habanero. habanero burgers! pork, shrimp, shrimp. shrimp chicken ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~vU_IpMaxsqVFTZMnpJYE-Q~The mojitos here are delicious... I love the original and the cucumber version.  The food is decent.  I've tried the mac-n-cheese (a bit spicy, but yummy), the flatbread (kinda bland, nothing special), the bacon wrapped dates (yummy, but you can only eat a couple before they are just too sweet), and the papas (very tasty).  My only complaint is that the place has been pretty dead every time I've been there... sure I don't like super crowded places, but I would literally be the only one talking in this place at times when the other 5 groups of people that were there would collectively have a lull in their conversations.  I don't know if people just haven't heard of this place or what.  The mojitos will keep me coming back, and hopefully a following will build for this place so it's a little more lively in the future.~cucumber cheese ( bacon ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~tvWVNN1-mmZPsvZvHyWGXA~Oh, Cana...how I LOVE thee...  I'm telling you, every thing about this place is amazing.  Not only the food is delicious, the drinks are unique and yummy, the decor is modern and comfortable, and the staff is very helpful when it comes to explaining the menu and giving suggestions.  I was introduced to this place in November 2010 and have been there 6 times.  This says a lot, because my boyfriend and I eat out often and it's hard to find a place that makes me want to come back time after time.    Cana's tapas are ALL delicious.  Beef empanadas, halibut, tuna ceviche, tacos, CHURROS!!  Oh my goodness, I need to go there for dinner!  LOL!  Anyways, their drinks are also amazing.  Fresh sugarcane...lime...DELICIOUS and consistently good every time!!  Cana truly is a gem!  Go!  Now...do it.~beef tuna ceviche, tacos, lime... ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~f3eDO1zvEFN_Gep0nFnsqA~I'm a sucker for tapas (or bocadillos in this case -- although I used to think bocadillos were sandwiches, which shows you how much I know, but I digress...). So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.  First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.  Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the "behind the bar" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.  As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even "really good" either.  - Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.  - Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.  - Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.  - Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.  - Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.  - Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.  We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.~sandwiches, ceviche -- ribs -- guava bacon cheese beef beef. beef. beef shrimp -- ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~TiFhGQkfWLO9-uEhOPEkUQ~My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new this weekend so we went to Caña. We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far. We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs. The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed. Cana should change it's layout into a lounge instead of a restaurant because it's more about the ambiance and view. The service was excellent and we tipped her accordingly but we will never go back.~ceviche, chicken bacon salad, meatballs. ceviche chicken salad coleslaw bacon cheese sour cream) meatballs ~1
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~YPo8aONNFpnxAVAVE5h3hg~I really, really, really wanted Cana's to be amazing and give me a new place to go for tapas...Fail. I went with a friend and sat at the bar to eat. We had to get the bartender's attention after being seated for about 5 mins, he was busy chatting with a friend at the other end of the bar. We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding. The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own "flair". And along with the mediocre food was the mediocre bartender, he literally left us with empty glasses for 10mins until we could get ahold of his bar back and had him actually make us drinks.  Firefly is still the king of Tapas Eateries in Las Vegas for me, Cana's was a disappointment.~meatballs, cheese, ~2
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~5DlhTrCbwZTa_6JCfgTSDA~So, this was like our 10th time going to Cana (in what I thought was 6 months but is really 2) and I have to say I have not been disappointed yet.  The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!  This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.    Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.    But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.  Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!  And thanks Cory and GM (Ben I think?) for making our visit so entertaining, educational and above all...FUN!~ceviche. ceviche mushroom ceviche. mushrooms. mushrooms tuna ceviche shrimp, chips. waffle potato chips brown potato chips chips ginger chips! ~5
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~lOpR2WktzEm2M95B1TfG-g~Ate here on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Nice easygoing ambiance with bold yet comforting modern decor of reds/browns/and touches of green. Attentive service and delicious tapas dishes. Highly recommend the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Cuban Sliders.   Note: check-in on 4square for a drink special !~tuna ceviche ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~2DVB1f6VIqB6qT7AK9z-eg~I'm extremely optimistic that this place will earn 5 stars on my next visit when I intend to order off their regular menu!  My father and I arrived for happy hour at 6 and were told it had just ended! Luckily the cordial manager Mike let us indulge in happy hour since their yelp ad lists happy hour from 4-7pm.  First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.  The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.  Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /  There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!  Their Hamachi Tiradito was a winner, and entirely cooked as opposed to raw. Raw might have been more delicious, but sashimi isn't exactly tapas.~gazpacho corn ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~Yu5NSP0c70Z3oVhrqc0LQg~We were a little skeptical at first - was told we were limited to the (small) lunch menu. However our server asked the chef who agreed to let us order from the dinner menu if there was something we were interested in (our group of 5). Ceviche-tapas style items were all very good and we were quite pleased. We stayed inside because it was a bit cold outside, but the view (of Townsquare) from the deck looked nice. We would consider going back again some time (we are locals).~ceviche- ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~Jdtx1_E-VGnzarUIpsciag~These are two perplexed stars because several people that I respect have given Cana lots of stars. My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.  The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the "crispy" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.    I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff. If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper. However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks, but eat at Firefly. The food at Firefly is 50% cheaper and 100% hotter.~ceviche, chicken chicken chicken mango shrimp ~2
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~mlo5rOV8NK10LoJKswKgKg~I was a bit disappointed with this place. A bunch of us girls decided to go for happy hour and it was just a huge let down. First of all, only certain drinks and food are happy hour priced. Why would we want to come here, when Blue Martini is next door with happy hour on everything?! We decided on a pitcher of the Sugarcane Sangria. The server told us that it was cheaper getting the pitcher, but beware this is full price during happy hour. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Chicken Empanada (this is not a HH item). I thought both were decent, but I definitely would say I wasn't impressed. Overall, I felt disappointed and we left to go to finish Happy Hour at Blue Martini.~mac and cheese ~2
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~nQh2BDsWDoIjP7sk8kg_4A~So this is my first yelp and I have read reviews on this site for quite sometime....one thing you will always get from me is an open mind and minimum negativity unless it is truly called for....for cana latin kitchen I will start first off by saying that this....raquel was our server....she was the only one on the floor and kept us happy.....her reccomendations we welcomed with open arms....go see her and I'm sure you will make a night of it for you....  We started first of course with some drinks. My boo ordered a strawberry basil margherita....when I asked her if she liked it she simply replied "this shit is hella good, I'm getting another!!" I order a cucumber mojito...I like a stiff drink but mine was a little rough....I won't judge it on that as I'm sure every other one they make is excellent. I sent mine back and had it replaced with the diablo dulce. It was different it had some rum pineapple juice habenero and garlic....I'm sure there was some other stuff but I'm a little fuzzy writing this at the moment. We went on to order the chicken empanadas....they were excellent....get them....they were the perfect amount of flaky and crunchy....not too much oil....after that we had the spicy tuna chiviche....it was good as well....big chunks of. We had the "hamachi" as well...that was excellent....cut like sashimi but cooked in citrus juice. We were up for more....we decided to ask rauqel what she liked....she said the dates....I said no thanks we are already on one haha (that was corny but who cares its fun)...we ordered the dates and calamari.....the dates were awsome...super sweet and wrapped in bacon....that calamari was just calamari....not too special...we finished off with the short rib tacos......if you decide to visit caña order those for sure....they are good....we were stuffed.....good food, good atmosphere,  and pretty unique drinks......its all reasonable tapas pricing too....go to townsquare and try it if you haven't before. You will be pleased.~cucumber pineapple garlic.... chicken tuna bacon.... tacos...... ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~SQrE2R2_NRoJHozQbE-5eQ~Had some time before a movie so we decided to try something other than our usual American fare at Town Square and Cana looked intrigueing.  Small plates of food give more chances to taste something different.  Order was: Hamachi  Chicken Empanadas Beef Empanadas Chicken Skewers Piggy Back Dates Crispy Shrimp Fish Tacos Short Rib Tacos  The Empanadas and Piggy Back Dates were the best things out of the selections.  I would come back just for those.  Everything else was ok but I wasn't feeling the Short Rib.  Cool place to try if you're looking for something a little different from Yardhouse or Cadillac Ranch.~chicken beef chicken shrimp tacos tacos ~3
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~wC8tEaI6koMQ7-g3Uh2vzg~A friend recommended this tapas spot and I absolutely enjoyed the apps we got except for one.   We ordered the meatballs, hamachi, beef tenderloin, calamari and they were all great. We also ordered the Cevichi mushrooms but that was the only fail out of the things we ordered cuz it was very citrusy and a bit sour so we had it sent back and the waitress recommended the spicy tuna and it was very good!  Met the General Manager and he hooked it up with their special dessert that evening which was with ice cream, fried bananas and chocolate and like some waffle haha, IT WAS AWESOME!  It was a bit pricey for the portions that came out but its a nice place to take a date out to and the atmosphere was really chill...   Over all I was pretty impressed myself... I would highly recommend this place as a date spot! :)~meatballs, beef mushrooms tuna ice cream, waffle date date ~4
8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA~mvAh3a3KJpKADj9eWVejUA~First, it is dark and you can't tell if it is even still in business when we were walking up. They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say "sorry you just missed Happy Hour". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?~beef ceviche, tuna, ribs, beef beef ~3
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~3xGR24wD5ILntyX2UXZWTA~We were passing town through and stopped based on the Yelp reviews. Mediocre suburban tex mex; not authentic Mexican which we prefer. Chips and salsa nothing special. Others in my group ordered burritos, which were ok. I ordered the Mexican salad and asked the waitress to add steak. It came as a nice mix of greens, covered in warm, melted Kraft cheddar cheese, no steak. The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing. However, she came back promptly with a big plate of steak to add to my salad and said it was ok, because my server had it down right but the kitchen missed it. The way she said it made me wonder what would have happened if the waitress had gotten it wrong . . .  Anyway, nothing terrible but I'd probably stop somewhere else next time.~chips salsa burritos, salad steak. greens, cheese, steak. steak steak salad ~3
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~2_BvxFBvtyMKjNf3gzmbqw~The blackened chicken quesadilla is amazing!! While the green salsa was a click too spicy for me, the flavor was unreal! I didn't have the margarita, but my sister did and said the taste was great! (It was small, so order a large if you want more)  I'm a big guacamole fan and this one again was great. Still too spicy for me, but if you can handle a little heat-you should love it. (BTW, I can barely handle any heat at all, so it's probably normal for most people ;) I say, grab some friends and try it out!~chicken salsa ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~V926hjwKcbT-ZVJOwSeXnQ~Update:  Allegedly this place is closed.  Obviously they did nothing to improve my on my previous review.  The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.  I am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.    If nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.    The food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant.   The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican).   With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.~fajita chicken steak fajita fajitas white white. ~2
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~HBcuWFsU-6VrvzYZUDZQzA~This place is great!! First time dining here but I will definitely be back. We ordered the guac, chicken/fish/shrimp tacos, and a chicken crisp and everything was great! The shrimp tacos were a little spicy, but good. The chicken was my fav! Had a tasty drink too...a blackberry/basil margarita. Highly recommend this restaurant.~tacos, chicken shrimp tacos chicken ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~fnO18xosHxN5E8tKtI3AGA~I needed a place for an office lunch of about 20 people and decided upon Cabo's. John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.  The service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.  Everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.  After lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience. Great food, great service and reasonable prices: quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign. I have a feeling that several of my group will be returning very soon.~chips tacos fajitas. poblano pork chips ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~tHKS8zpaJ2PU0RFqgsa1Hg~How does this restaurant only have 3 1/2 stars?? I've been here twice and the food was excellent both times. The steak enchiladas are fantastic, with high quality meat and fresh sauce. The service is good, with friendly and attentive staff. I'm really glad there's a Mexican restaurant out this way and ecstatic that it's this good.~steak ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~D41x80cel8xzkWGeHKpCkA~Guacamole was dry, we even mixed in salsa but didn't help. Most of the time you find yourself eating your grac, fat b/c it is good...We surrendered and sent it back...sad, this is off to a bad start.  Ok, wow the chips are out of a box...and nasty....Oh no....~salsa chips ~3
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~DdejAQTqbNgzYQ7Vzx95sA~Really wanted to like this place, as it's convenient to our home, and I love good Mexican food.  Salsa seemed canned, not very flavorful.  Chips thick, obviously brought it.  My husband had the mixed fajitas- amazingly, hardly any flavor.  It came with no more than a teaspoon of guacamole and pico de gallo.    I had the stuffed poblano.  Nothing special.  Just mashed potatoes in a roasted poblano.  Service was okay, but food was sub-par at best.  We didn't take the leftovers home, and will not be back.~salsa chips poblano. poblano. ~1
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~NHq8lBiaBx2tALucrxpW6w~Muy bien! In a town with more Mexican restaurants per capita than Tijuana, Cabo's certainly stands out above the rest. The decor is way better than El Toro or Dos Reales and I don't get the feeling that I might get salmonella at all.   Dos XX Ambar on draft Bad Ass Pork Tacos Chicken Enchiladas Delicious rice with corn in it  It loses one star for just ok service. Some confusion with the wait staff and kitchen. Other than that the experience was excellent. Way to go Cabo's!~pork tacos chicken corn ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~WemhFLLKIBb0_QlEBNu34g~I second Brian A.'s review. Good vibe, good food, ok service. Quesadillas are not enchiladas. When I did get my enchiladas they were admittedly a little Tex-Mex, but still topped enchiladas from other Mexican restaurants in the area. Earlier reviews state that the beans seem to come from a can...disagree. It's called substance. Overall, great experience and will definitely be trying again to confirm!~quesadillas ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~fPjszzArAWPksVLTQnVzCA~*** UPDATE 10/1/2014: Sadly, Cabo's Cantina is now closed.  It was great while it lasted.***  We stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and "naked" with a spice "rub" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)  The main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.  The chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.    The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables.   The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those "tall tables" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.    The wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.    Parking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.  All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.~cheese tomato- jalapeno- pork tacos pork, cilantro, sour cream. salsa ( chips) tacos taco corn tortillas. cheese pizza chips salsa salsa, salsa. tomatillo salsa salsa chips steak tacos burritos. steaks tacos steaks. chips salsa, ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~zbo_tBiM2FP3YtW7NlcAsg~What a lunch!! I cannot wait to come back here for dinner, this time with my husband. When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth! It was spicy and juicy! Pork was cooked so perfectly! My mouth was definitely in heaven. Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the "Magic Sauce". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it.  What I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it. Unfortunately for me, it was lunch time and since I had to go back to work, I did not have a cocktail. Looking forward to going there again soon with my husband and getting some cocktails as well. I hope this place never goes out of business. Great location too!~pork taco, pork spinach salad. salad cheese burger ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~dxHBFKzvQ7V7gg3CA8z-Tw~I went to Cabo's the first time for dinner because Billy Barooz (same owner,same strip mall) was on a wait list. It was marginal, but had only been open a short time.  We had tamales, stuffed chili, a burger and pork tacos.  Tamales were all dough with a bland salsa verde.  The tacos are described as spicy, and they were - way hot cayenne.  Service was OK, rushed, but everything got there.  The second trip was way better, service was friendly, and relaxed.  They were not as crowded.  We had burgers, and steak tacos.  I had the Black Jack burger with fried jalapeno, cheese, and two beef patties.  It stood about four inches tall and had a great beef flavor.   A side order of cheese curds was way overcooked though.  This place will continue to get better as the staff settles in, and the kitchen gets sorted out.~tamales, burger pork tacos. tamales salsa tacos cayenne. burgers, steak tacos. burger jalapeno, cheese, beef beef cheese ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~-0_8QpYygxUAs696NXdZCA~First let me say that I love Mexican food and really wanted to like this place since it is very close to my office.  I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made "in house so they are extra yummy."  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.  They have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.  I ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.  The burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then "grill" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.  I prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience.~salsa salsa chicken burrito ~1
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~f-PZnzigTat6uI2PSyx2rw~My girlfriend and I came in around 5 PM on a Saturday. Wasn't too busy and we were quickly seated. The waitress brought us chips and salsa. She was very prompt and helpful. Throughout our visit she was very quick to refill our drinks.  After quickly looking over the menu we both decided on getting the chimichanga. (My personal favorite) It seemed like the food took a bit longer than we were expecting but not too bad.  Once our order arrived, it looked delicious. However, that was not the case. As others have mentioned, the black beans have an off taste. The rice is pretty bland and underwhelming. Both the rice and beans were cold. The chimichanga is filled mostly with rice and beans which didn't help. Unfortunately, the entire meal was just rather mediocre.  Although the food wasn't the greatest, you do get large portions. My girlfriend and I decided if we tried coming again, we might just split an entree. She said she would give the restaurant 3 out of 5.  Honestly, I couldn't recommend going here. The food just wasn't that good. Hopefully, they can improve and perhaps we can try it again.~chips salsa. chimichanga. black beans chimichanga ~2
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~LVMdHcurRep_3F0yO6jv3A~Champaign is full of middling but not terrible places for Mexican food. You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.  I just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.  You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.  Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based "crust." The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.  I've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.  Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.  As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.~chips salsa, chips tortilla chips ~5
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~63KRAtd8rTlx-rmOLds50w~So let me first say that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like the place-- especially after so many positive reviews.   Food: HOLF SH*T SALTY. I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through.   Service: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers.   Drinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice.   We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place.   Basically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here.~black beans chicken burrito ~1
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~qZwPe5Ybc_7wVF61_-UwRQ~Great dining experience with the food and service. The margaritas are tasty and the veggie burrito, in particular, is fantastic.~burrito, ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~OAOsY1rOLvR7hnvGvg2r9A~I went there for breakfast this morning and the food was great. I had the steak and eggs. The service and atmosphere were also good.~steak ~4
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~ky_GtQE1tUHqtQHt6M4VcA~Went here Saturday afternoon around 1:30 and the place was dead.  It took forever to be waited on.  Once we ordered then we waited what seemed like a very long time to get our food.  The food was not edible.  The black beans were chalky and cold and had a funny flavor.  They serve the Chimichanga with rice and beans on the outside and on the inside.  I ordered a chicken Chimichanga but all that was in it was rice and beans and not very good rice and beans either!    I ordered a classic margarita and it was good but it's about a 4 ounce glass and cost $7.  Get real!!!!  The inside is really nice (just like Smoke Que and Brew) but the service and the food suck!  I will not go back for a second try to this place.  I would have had anyone working there really cared about anything but they did not.  They didn't even have the Illini game on until we asked them to turn it on.~black beans chimichanga chicken chimichanga ~1
1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w~S2M4PvJu3Qlam50pmL9clA~I was so anxious for this place to open and when it did I was thoroughly impressed! I work and live nearby so having a place to eat good Mexican food is a must!   The menu is just great.  Lets talk drinks first.  I'm definitely a margarita lover so having Cabo's wide selection was awesome! Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar! How cool! The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious. This combo goes great together.  However, my personal favorite is the Platinum Margarita. Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better!  So food. To start off, the chips and salsa must be good at a Mexican place, and this place surely scores a 10 by me! The stuffed poblano is really what hits the spot for me, but I do love a good taco! And this is definitely the place for that!  Overall this place is a winner for me. Everyone is so nice, food is great, and the drinks are awesome! I really can't wait for warm weather so the patio is open!~lime chips salsa poblano taco! ~5
4_X7bpnWV_VBcp7JQBvlWQ~L16VW_42wYLEsMcjR4zRwg~Very nice golf courses,  the front 9 are killers. A bucket of golf balls will run you $9.  The clubhouse has good wraps and burgers for lunch and is open to the public for dinner.  They have all you can eat fish on Fridays. The food is okay,  but the bar is better.~wraps burgers ~4
68s1OlziLPXKvdwBLV_pGw~IKXnE5u7eB1MBVl2iILTww~La Maison Du Patriote is your home away from home, with one exception: it's a crazy party home over the weekends (the home every teenager dreams of). The first thing you notice as you walk up the stairs to the hostel is the homey atmosphere of the place. It actually feels like a home - the tiny kitchen with the wooden cupboards and drawers, the "chill room" with the musical instruments, and curtains just hanging in the 22 bed dorm. The place is kept very clean and tidy.   The crowd of people who stay there were also pretty awesome. Some people were playing the instruments, others were playing card games, while others were cooking up delicious meals. It's a great place to meet some people to chill out and/or to explore the city together.   The staff were also very friendly and approachable. They don't actually have 24hr reception there though, but they leave instructions in front of the door so you can get in the house any time of the day.    The hostel was located right in the heart of the Old Port of Montreal, where most of the tourist attractions there. The Old Port is a gorgeous place to wander about at night.   One bad thing is that the Internet was extremely slow when I was there (and it didn't work half the time), but this is something they may have fixed since then. There is also a pretty decent coffee shop down the road with Internet, so it's really not a big deal.~coffee ~4
1J69KdlcuXRMCyOFqtQNgg~hNbur9CyHDxrLqIpYdxXog~Best  pizza crust in Vegas! The service was fast, friendly and orderly. Ordered the Canadian bacon with pineapple toppings, just as great as every time I've eaten. Also ordered the side Caesar salad and Mac and cheese. yum o. recommend for tasty fast food in between the gambling and movies.~pizza bacon pineapple salad mac and cheese ~5
1J69KdlcuXRMCyOFqtQNgg~KdosSHNhbamIrXHHLqCWmQ~Ah, Sbarro: the mainstay of every mall or food court since I can remember. With their large pizzas, variety of sides, and large drinks, how can you not like this place?  On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)  Service here is always pretty quick and simple. Prices are ok (I paid like 7.80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food!) I'll keep coming back here when I'm in the Texas, for sure!~pizza pepperoni pizza ~4
5kCRty4p7tBwM9P7MAXgvA~7QkIWDXiKXxDY0XXyDHXzA~Okay, to be honest, I don't like Giant Eagle in general. I think it's an enormous rip off, and I do not shop here for my usual grocery hauls. However, this Giant Eagle is right by my house, so whenever I need to run to the store for a random item or two (usually 2-4x per month), this is where I go.   This Giant Eagle is very clean, well stocked, and has a very good selection. Their bakery, sushi, already prepared foods (like rotisserie chickens), salad bar, and wine selection are really nice. They also offer a lot of items that I have a hard time finding at other stores (a certain yogurt, bread, etc.)   The employees at this location are split about 50/50. Half are nice and/or competent, and the other half are either rude and/or don't know what they are doing. For example, I was in there one day in the 12 items or less line, and this lady was trying to buy individual clementines. The cashier said they didn't sell individual clementines and wondered where she got them. Two other employees were also there (one was checking out, and another was from the self checkout area), and no one knew where these clementines were from. So theyre just holding up the already long line trying to figure it out when I informed them that they're the free ones that are for kids while parents are shopping. I hardly even come here and I knew that, lol. Really? Three employees had no clue?   Another time I called to place a cake order, and apparently it was a real inconvenience to the bakery lady who was super rude evvvery step of the process. But whatever, the white cake with the satin (whipped) frosting from GE is so delicious that I'm willing to put up with rude employees to get it.   But, I'll still give this location 4 stars because it's not a bad store, it's clean, and they're always stocked. The prices are a rip off, and they could use more cashiers, especially during busy times- but what grocery store doesn't have that problem. The parking also sucks because all of the people are whipping in and out of the parking lot in their luxury vehicles going to and from Crocker Park, Giant Eagle, and all the other shops in the vicinity, but if you like to live on the edge, it's not too big of a deal.~sushi, salad cake white cake ~4
5kCRty4p7tBwM9P7MAXgvA~IV5KLRGdO4m-16NsK3vkXw~I had a relative staying in an extended stay residence up the street from this Giant Eagle, so I ended up shopping here quite a bit over several months.  On the plus side, it is larger than many of the other Giant Eagles and, since it has more space, offers a better selection of many items than you get at the smaller stores.  It also carries more of certain items like prepared foods, sushi, wine, candy by the pound, and bakery than the Giant Eagles closer to Cleveland - I'm guessing this is due to its location in a more affluent suburb where people are more likely to spend on these products.  It also has more floor space devoted to seasonal items such as local sports memorabilia and (at Christmas time) Christmas ornaments, so I have found some interesting things to buy other than food here.   On the minus side, the store layout is not very user-friendly.  Upon entering the store you have to navigate the large bakery, prepared food, wine and seasonal sections before you even get to the food.  I realize this is to encourage you to spend on these items but if you go in specifically to get a can of beans or a package of meat, it's a pain having to walk about a half mile just to get to standard food items.  The food aisles also don't go all the way through the store front to back.  Instead the aisle is divided in half by another aisle and different products are placed on the two halves of the aisle.  This has made it very hard for me to find things several times.   The store also seems to have way too much useless junk for sale, such as cheap children's toys and books.  Finally, this store always seems to have uniformed security guards hanging around prominently, making me wonder what is going on at this location to make that necessary, as I go to several Giant Eagles located closer to Cleveland and do not see this kind of "security presence" at any of them unless the police have been specifically called to deal with some incident.  Since Westlake does not seem like a high crime area (in fact the opposite) I have to wonder why 1-2 uniformed security men are needed at this particular store.~sushi, ~3
5kCRty4p7tBwM9P7MAXgvA~wFJVjUv6pmTGew0-zG7Upw~I like some of their sushi and a lot of their specials are good.  But their normal prices are high - at the level of Heinens, but lower quality, much worse service and it takes twice as long to shop there due to its size and layout.~sushi ~2
5VZFneSINtbXhxPPiedXyA~xp-dpFQbw4kHF4IVBhq9dA~I stumbled in here in a drunken haze one Monday evening. Its quite a large, sprawling bar which is nice enough. As the name suggests it is an Irish bar and popular with the many Irish in Edinburgh.  Its located on a side street off the Grassmarket, I probably couldn't find it sober to be honest. I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.  My poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!). Then we came in here and it was his round, unlucky for him. Vodka and coke and JD and coke came to just over £6. Poor guy was in shock! So a little expensive. But its quite fun and it has a good atmosphere with friendly bar staff. For future reference they do a student night on Wednesday, so go then for the cheap drinks!~coke coke ~3
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~eMuvx_BUoDwsO1UToVyOeg~Worse than a grade school cafeteria canned food. Only bright spot... it is definitely low salt.  French toast was mushy and nasty.  Coffee smelled burnt... but had no taste. Asked non coffee drinking husband to try and he agreed.  No matter the coupon... not worth the meal.~french toast coffee coffee ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~eyqkArl-blVw6Wf4NcLbpQ~My wife and I both ordered the rib eye steak dinner for $10.99.  It came with a choice of soup or salad (we chose the salad with a delicious Greek house dressing), giant baked potato and mixed vegetables (out of a can), and free dessert (choice of ice cream or rice pudding - we chose rice pudding and brought it home.  The steaks were slightly over-cooked and not great, but not bad, smothered in onions and mushrooms (out of a can).  The baked potatoes were the highlight of the meal.  Luna's is an old-fashioned kind of restaurant, not very busy on a Saturday night.  Good service (she forgot the dinners rolls, but got them immediately when we asked) and very good value.  We will be back.~steak soup salad ( salad baked potato ~3
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~LF4h_R7bCURk9yPzvQ1meA~Food is bland. Reminds me of hospital food. chicken soup was a big bowl  but truly had only one small cube of chicken in it. Vegetables have been reheated multiple times resulting in the peas being hard as rocks. Mashed potatoes were "instant."  Coffee is good. Waitress was nice and kept refilling my coffee. I won't go back, however.~chicken soup chicken peas instant. coffee coffee. ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~9CExDW97_IMeIyNqCB7GPQ~This place was fine for breakfast, the greek scramble was tasty and hearty. Nice owners, very fast (even curt) servers but overall friendly enough. Don't expect gourmet and you won't be disappointed. Decor is about three decades out of date though. Not sure why some reviewers are so down on this place.~date ~3
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~BWGZyqT_tkTlU2hLYpl5xg~This place used to be Five Points Deli & Restaurant, I don't know if it was an ownership change or just a name change.  I'm not considering this a full review, since we just stopped in here for dessert and coffee.  I'll have to come back for an actual MEAL, and do more of a review then.  3 of us ordered desserts (2 slices of cake, one of the apple pie).  Received ginormous portions (especially of the cake, 3 of us could split one slice of that).  Everything was tasty, but not made on-premises (I actually think I saw packaging from Sam's in the dessert case on the way out).  Decent value for the money.  This area doesn't have many options if you've got the taste for dessert (other than ice cream) and don't want to whip up some brownies.  Food I saw on other tables all looked pretty good.  Pleasant server, decent "diner-style" ambiance.  Pretty extensive menu, especially for breakfast.  Spotless bathroom.  I'll have to swing by here soon.  I think the Corned Beef Hash is calling out to me!~coffee. desserts ( cake, apple pie) cake, ice cream) corned beef ~3
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~yq4k33NObOl544z92xLChA~Stopped in here Mother's Day for breakfast because every other place was packed. Don't usually come here for the same reasons mentioned in other reviews about service, cleanliness, etc. Again, got the same put out attitude from the servers and slimy table top near the kitchen. The big thing that got me this time was as the wife and I sat there waiting for our food, one of the bus boys who was apparently on his break and looked to be one of the owners relatives, reached over our table to grab some ketchup to put on HIS plate of eggs! He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic. Nobody that worked there said a word to this oaf as he chowed down! We just looked at each other and laughed in disbelieve! Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs! The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them! The staff looked horrified like they didn't expect this much overflow on Mother's Day or capable of handling it! Only got one refill of coffee in this panicked frenzy of pisses off staff and patrons! As we left the owner took our money with a smile as if he was oblivious to the chaos going on behind him! Wow! Last time, no more!~coffee ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~AKt3-PhndRMgk8n4eQC2rA~Must have the Luna's Corned Beef sandwich.... Amazing.~corned beef ~5
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~39gLe_xb9UfyBr_Xe9AdSQ~My husband and I were out for a Sunday drive when we spotted this restaurant and decided to stop for dinner.  After a quick visit to the clean restroom, we were greeted and seated immediately.  Three menus appeared...  Daily specials, breakfast menu, and the full menu.  We chose to go to the dinner route.  Our waitress could not have been more helpful.  On her recommendation, we both chose the fried chicken dinner.  It was crunchy, slightly sweet, and oh so good!  It came with potato, rolls, corn, and either soup or salad.  I had the Italian wedding soup which was delicious.... Not heavy on celery taste, although clearly there was celery added.  Dinner comes with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, if you like.  We felt lucky to find this place.  Our waitress was so attentive, never missing a beat.  If we lived closer, we would definitely be back!~fried chicken ~4
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~gNevv1EYmQ7mJPlZYsE0Mg~Found Luna's through Yelp and glad we did. Great service and quality food at low prices. The parking lot was full but we didn't have a long wait. Hubs ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs which he scarfed down. I had a denver omlette bagel sandwich which was delicious. So glad we stopped.~sandwich ~4
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~pbvL9ZAuB6-RhmrcXoCyRQ~I had the chicken noodle soup which was the strangest tasting I've ever had. The fish fry was extremely greasy as well. The staff wasn't very friendly and as I was leaving I noticed that all of the bakery in the display case was purchased from WalMart..~chicken soup ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~W4su1AfjH23TD68Le-y6Jg~Glad we went back a second time -- for all the wrong reasons!  First visit, owner could not have been friendlier, server was attentive & friendly, my AYCE cod dinner came with delicious lentil soup & canned or frozen corn, french fries were good, wife's sandwich was decent if not memorable, kitchen did a good job in getting orders out, restrooms were clean, dining area was orderly.  But the second trip -- had the fried cod dinner again, and there was something N-O-T Q-U-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T about it, tartar sauce wasn't even fully mixed, in place of the corn I had mixed (ugh!) veggies, french fries almost soggy, rice pudding had a liberal dose of cinnamon but it was still thin and tasteless, owner too busy on a personal phone call to say hello.  The good news -- our server was excellent, the kitchen got orders out quickly again, the rest rooms still clean, the dining room still neat and orderly.  the lentil soup was still quite good.  Weren't there for breakfast, but their breakfast menu looks good, with eggs, omelettes, waffles, skillets, etc.   Go east or west on Route 82 for some better options.~lentil soup ~2
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~Ws-4ormTU91ZL1g62y4SQQ~Horrific food, horrific service. We had a frozen burger and a wilted salad of iceburg lettuce that was way over seasoned. The waitress brought the check before the food and didn't check on us again. Obviously prepared food with shortcuts. I am very disappointed.~burger salad lettuce ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~5-IZh0KF10GQiCTczXmM8Q~I walked in and first of all it smelled like mold and i smelled the bathrooms from the front door. The wait was short, however, the server almost didn't notice that I was there. it seemed like there was no host to seat me. The server asked politely, if i would like a table or booth. I asked for a booth. I was seated and the server, asked, what can i get you to drink. I ordered my drink and the server left. As I am drinking my pop, the server finally brings me the menu and leaves again. As I am looking at the menu I noticed there were family members of the owner/manager (maybe), helping out in which I thought was cute? But kind of weird! I thought that it was sweet that a family business was helped by togetherness of family members. As I am waiting for the server to return  to take my order I noticed that some of the tables were dirty and the floor was sticky. It seemed  that the tables were not properly wiped off. The server finally came back to take my order, i ordered the corn beef and fries instead of cabbage  and a salad with oil and vinegar then hums as an appetizer. I sat and waited for my order for about 15-20 minutes. The owner/manager was walking around helping out his family members. That's a good owner/manager helping out. The server brought out the salad with the dressings. I notice that the dressing  bottle was very dirty, The rest of the food came out all at once instead of the appetizer first. The hummus did not taste like hummus. The hummus was very tasteless. The corn beef was bland and the carrots tasted like  they came from a can from the store. The fries tasted as if they were prefrozened  and prepared from a bag instead of fresh. After looking at the dessert i remember seeing the brand of cake sold at walmart... not fresh.~corn beef ~2
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~sa3sR6Lck4UiGkHmwTat7Q~For some reason, even though there were only a few tables with diners, our waitress seated us right by the kitchen. She kept coming over and rushing us to make a decision.  When I say rushing I mean like every minute or so.   Seriously.   The Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup.  The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust.  Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it.  But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.    If the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.  It is obvious no one wants to be there.  They don't care about the quality of their food or service. Now we know why the parking lot was almost empty on a Friday night.  We will not be back for another try.   Someone should write to Robert Irvine.  Maybe him and Restaurant Impossible can help.  Or, maybe not.~chicken soup soup. salad lettuce onion meatloaf fried chicken ~1
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~9i3N8qbd6hRy6QjsIkFhIw~Food is always good service is sometimes iffy, but that's ok. They have great sandwiches and soup. Will always come back~sandwiches soup. ~4
2S1s1gKstsgRtUTVxKO79w~YwjbA_XApabf7yn2LjsRLA~Gross, dirty, poor service, and crappy food to boot! Will never come back to this garbage "restaurant". The waitress was rude and seem annoyed that I brought children to eat with me. The charged me for a glass of water if you can imagine. My sandwich was soggy as were the fries. Avoid this place!~sandwich fries. ~1
243PQVgkx8eUzVaKCgC-gw~ItINxpCKnvMuvH4ADog-bA~We have been twice and more than happy both times.  Typical convenient store, with a nice hot kitchen with plenty to choose from... Pizza by the slice, whole pizzas, chicken, subs, etc.  First trip: we each had the Italian sub (hot) and split an order of chicken tenders & jojos.  The Italian subs were great!  We were more than impressed.  For an Italian sub, it was as good as it gets.  The jojos were decent... Good size, ok flavor.  The tenders left much to be desired... Too bland for our liking.  Second trip: we each had the Italian subs (of course!) and split a snack pack (4 whole wings & 2 jojos).  the subs, they were as good as the first time!  These subs are probably 8", not the biggest but, big enough and with great flavor!  The jojos were as they were the first time but the wings were delicious!  Much more flavor then the tenders.  On our next trip, we'll go for a mixed bucket of chicken for sure!~pizza chicken, chicken chicken ~4
243PQVgkx8eUzVaKCgC-gw~ZWDbcoQJk3f_Kz87meL3mQ~Good pizza whether you order or are on the go. You can't beat the 4.99 lunch special. Great subs, hot or cold.~pizza ~4
243PQVgkx8eUzVaKCgC-gw~GCfcKNt_j1hNxX58OZzUTQ~A convenient store with a good hot kitchen. You can either order a pizza or sub or you can take advantage of their hot and ready pizza by the slice. There is a sign on the deli cooler that says if you spend $20 in groceries you get a free pizza. I'm not sure if that's for any grocery items in the store or only items from the deli.   I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area.   I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there. Everybody just minds their own business and moves on just as it should be.   So stop by and grab a few slices of pizza and don't forget to get a Cold Classic Glass Bottled Coke to go with it.~pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza coke ~4
243PQVgkx8eUzVaKCgC-gw~xIFUKn4l8oL882wmBnNjKQ~Chapman's is a nice little convenience store in a neighborhood across from a boarded up house in Lorain.  The two people I've encountered working there are the friendliest people you'll meet. The young man is the cashier and the older lady works the kitchen. They make a great team.  The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.   I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too. The fried chicken looked really fresh and juicy also. Maybe I'll give they a try next time after I'm off my clean eating kick.  This last visit was a cheat meal, I swear!~fried chicken ~4
2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ~gyL2VLuZP2tQreRc4vxx-g~We came in because it looked like it was small mom and pop restaurant. There was a family and 2 other couples there.  It's a small space.  Prices are reasonable.  Home cooked style meals.  We ordered an entree of steak, calamari, and grilled cod.  There are several sides to order from.  We thought it was a good meal.  Prices were reasonable.~steak, ~4
2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ~hlbW04oS-XHQtIUTyu7UBg~Rhum Corner was closed so we walked on and found this place! It was empty, but we sat down anyways. We were starved. We ordered the fish cakes and shrimp patties- for starters. They were fresh and delicious. Piping hot, I tell ya. We were stuffed before our quarter chicken dinners came. But when they arrived, hot with fresh veggies and rice...not to forget the grilled chicken, our greedy sides kicked in and we dug in. It truly is very very good food. I felt like I had a really good home cooked meal. I had leftovers to take home. Don't go in here if you are on a strict diet, that is not going to stick! Haha~shrimp chicken chicken, ~5
2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ~ghuU8vusxnrSc30gF7e-oQ~I was lost somewhere around Queen street in a snowstorm with a gurgling, uneasy feeling in my stomach when I came across this place. All it took was the words "Churrasqueira" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like "Carniceria," which always means good food.  I parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.  About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old "hi there, let me know if you have any questions!" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.  Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.  Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.  The chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.  All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.~olive chicken chicken butter. chicken salad, potatoes, chicken, chicken potatoes. chicken chicken- ~5
2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ~f43S9Hn80dvLSaEem7NdGQ~Hidden gem?  Maybe, maybe not... Tasty and good value?  Definitely!  This completely unassuming super authentic Portuguese place is located in currently trendifying and hipsterfying part of Dundas West between Bathurst and Ossington.  Decor is minimal with a TV.  Expect to see lots of Portuguese families in this casual, casual joint.  The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses.  The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.  The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done; however, the flavor was actually good.  I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway.  Fries were pretty limp.  SERVICE was friendly and very casual.  Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush.  The food took a long time to come out, but the free bread and olives helped with the wait.    OVERALL. the VALUE is good.  Most of the entrees are in the $8-$13 range.  Drinks are fairly reasonable as well.  It doesn't quite rate as a hidden gem, but I'll call it a hidden cubic zirconium.~chicken steak, steak fries ~3

-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~TrIOx_YXY5oYep3mVQIkTQ~Das Steak-Restaurant Montero* hat im September 2009 in Stuttgart-Schönberg eröffnet und ist eine echte Bereicherung für den Süden Stuttgarts.    Erstaunlich, was man aus der Sportlerkneipe des TSV Birkach zaubern konnte! Schöne Steakhaus-Atmosphäre, gemütlich dunkel (Lederstühle, dunkle Tische, z. T. Täfelung), aber dennoch modern, fast ein wenig stylish!    Service tadellos, zuvorkommend, freundlich. Wir haben sogar einen Schnaps auf Kosten des Hauses bekommen.    Und das Essen: Sehr gutes Fleisch von südamerikanischen Rindern, genau richtig gegrillt. Dazu leckere Kartoffelecken. Auch der Baked Potato am Nebentisch sah gut aus, ebenso der gemischte Salat und der Beilagenspinat. Und das Erstaunliche: sehr humane Preise (z. B. 180 gr-Steak für 11 EUR). Außerdem auf der Speisekarte: Fisch und Meeresgetier, Vegetarisches, sogar Maultaschen und ein paar weitere schwäbische Zugeständnisse.    Große Sonnenterrasse, schöner Spielplatz für Kinder, ausreichend Parkplätze vor dem Haus. Sogar eine Kegelbahn gibt es. Für Gruppen lässt sich ein Teil des Restaurants abteilen.    Absolut empfehlenswert!    *früher Im Ramsbachtal, noch früher Da Franco~steak- baked potato ~4
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~gJpMutA6JEmGxIUYMJPgyw~war mit einem DailyDeal Gutrschin rund 50km weit mit meiner Frau angereist. Muss sagen, es hat sich wirklich gelohnt. Argentinisches Steak, auf den Punkt gegrillt! So muß es sein! Beilagenteller sehr vielfältig, mit Gemüse und auch noch einen knackigen Salatteller dazu. Sehr freundliches Personal, hat immer wieder um einen gekümmert, aber nicht aufdringlich...~steak, ~4
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~0PyDDq033kYTTENzwjfVIA~Es ist schon eine Weile her seit wir im Mon Tero waren. Auch wir hatten einen Gutschein von Groupon oder Dailydeal für Steaks mit Beilagen.  Man kann wirklich sagen: vereinsheim von außen nicht wirklich einladend, aber innen sehr liebevoll zu einem schönen steakhouse-restaurant umgebaut. Leider ist der Gastraum sehr ausladend und wirkt schnell ungemütlich, wenn nicht viele Gäste da sind Das Essen war super  v.a. für den Preis. Die reguläre Speisekarte klingt ansprechend und weist saisonbedingte Sepzialitäten aus. Die Preise sind für die Qualität fair. Die Bedienung war unaufdringlich, jedoch aufmerksam. Das Ambiente ist gemütlich, nicht zu lachs aber auch nicht zu steif.  Wir kommen bestimmt wieder~steaks ~5
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~EglJD7Eadt0_YlxkjGfhug~Ich wurde durch einen Angebotsflyer auf das neue Mon Tero in Schönberg aufmerksam. Es liegt am Rande des Stadtteils direkt an Wald und Wiesen des Ramsbachtals. Gestern (29.3.10) entschloss ich mich sponatan mit Begleitung das Restaurant aufzusuchen. Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Gebäude gehört wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-stätten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgastätte. Überbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise übernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische)  Es gibt einen Tresen und ausreichende Sitzmöglichkeiten die den heutigen An-sprüchen angepasst wurden. Trotz allem blitzt das Sportlerheimambiente durch, dem sollte sich jeder Besucher bewusst sein. Zum Essen: Das Angebot (bis 1.4.10 nur Mo/Di/Do) versprach 200g frisches Filet-Steak mit Beilagensalat für 15 EUR pro Person ! Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert.  Er überzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon länger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt. Garniert mit einem großen Salatblatt, ein kleines Stück Kräuterbutter und Danke der Küche eine Portion Kartoffelecken ;-) Das Steak war nicht ganz nach meinem Wunsch gebraten, was ich aber nicht reklamierte. Es war sehr schmackhaft, zart innen und aussen lecker kroß angebraten. Wirklich sehr gute Qualität. Fazit: Gutes Essen zu angemessenem Preis, sehr freundliche und nicht aufdringliche Bedienung. Ein Besuch ist lohnenswert. Tipp: Bei der Platzwahl nicht in Tresennähe  mich haben die Sportler und ihre lauten Unterhaltungen genervt ;-) Schönberg rüstet auf !!~sport- steak steak steak ~4
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~ozgXcu-kXqMnvklxncOW_g~Ich wurde durch die Seite DailyDeal auf dieses Restaurant aufmerksam. Zum Essen gabe es ein argentinisches Steak mit Salatbüffet und Beilage. Da wir zu viert waren, hatte uns der Kellner angeboten einen großen Beilagenteller zu machen. Das war echt eine super idee. Viel Auswahl und auch vollkommen ausreichen.    Wir sind definitiv ohne Hunger aus dem Restaurant rausgegangen und haben einen schönen Abend verbracht, mit sehr nettem Personal. Das Essen war echt super und das Steak war so wie es sein muss.    Nur zu empfehlen und auf jeden Fall ein Besuch wert ;-)~steak steak ~5
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~lwL6-VZltqHJlkpig-_7dA~I've had a tough time finding steak around this area that compares with what I'm used to having back home. Finally found one! It can be a bit on the pricy side, but that's to be expected for a place like this. When I'm looking to go out for steak, I'll be going here from now on! FYI -  Its off the beaten path on the edge of a neighborhood where you would least expect to find a restaurant.~steak steak, ~5
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~JpExqLvfsfOWPEir4cjIQg~Steak (englisch) und Steak (Medium) waren perfekt. Die Beilagen sind relativ klein  vor allem die Kräuterbutter. Das Restaurant kann trotz liebevoller Gestaltung und Ausstattung seine Ursprung als Vereins-Gaststätte leider nicht ganz verbergen. Dafür hat man aber sehr viel Platz zwischen den Tischen. Wichtige Info: nur Barzahlung möglich!~steak ( steak ( ~4
-gaJJxkwBX3JjXnRWkfGwA~bJ2wECzWWCVaGKmRsmWI7Q~Bin über eine Empfehlung auf das Restaurant aufmerksam geworden. Habe dann im Internet einen Gutschein für 20EUR anstatt 45EUR für zwei Personen Steak mit Beilage gefunden und bin dann gestern miit nem Kumple da essen gegangen.    Also muss sagen, war voll auf zufrieden, es gab gute Parkmöglichkeiten, was ich persönlich sehr wichtig finde, da ich echt kein Bock hab da ewig zu suchen oder zu laufen.    Das Ambiente was auch angemessen, also schöne Dekoration und so im Süd-Amerika Stil, neue Möbel usw.    Zur Vorspeise gab es ein üppiges Salatbuffet, mit vielen Salten unter anderen auch Rukula und Kartoffelsalat.    Die Steaks mit Beilage waren rießig und wie ich finde perfekt gebraten. Sie waren sehr groß und das Fleisch war zart und saftig. Meine Beilage, ich glaube es waren so dickere Pommes, war ok. Ich hätte sie lieber etwas knuspriger gehabt.    Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich.    Alles in allem ein sehr schönes und gutes Steak Restaurant welches auf jeden Fall ein Geheimtipp hier in der Umgebung ist.    Also wir werden sicherlich noch öfters hin gehen.~steak steaks steak ~5
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~mnu8x2-RFiC3hTEBJ35vwQ~The only good thing about this Sobeys is that it is open 24 hours. That being said, I went there at 2am on Friday night to get pizza and Gatorade.  Then I waited for 10 minutes at the only open cash. I asked the security guard what the deal was, and he replied "the checkout guy is in the bathroom". Ten minutes in the bathroom while you're the only guy working seems a bit ridiculous to me.   When the guy finally returned, of course I commented on how long myself and the others in line were waiting. He did not take kindly to this and actually grabbed my hand when returning my change and wouldn't let go. It was creepy and aggressive.   I was going to complain to Sobeys about this guy but I figure he's probably  got a criminal record and this is the only job he can get, so I'd feel bad if he was fired.   Maybe they should get a self-check out like Loblaws~pizza ~2
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~CqMTskBCk_fZvz5XDm7Wgw~This is still a Sobey's, so for me it'll never tip to a five star, but I do have some nice things to add.   I bought scallops and salmon here, and their seafood selections are really pretty impressive. They have competitive lobster prices, which I plan on indulging in soon. They also have a "we boil while you shop" scenario which isn't for this east coast gal, but it seems like a really good option for many.   I'd also like to give props to their pre-made supper selections. So much more than dome chickens, check it out if you're in a pinch. Their Greek salad is especially delightful.~salmon salad ~4
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~hPTeXD7rV6JA5wT0YQjKCA~Not quite A-OK, more like B-OK. Two and a half stars.  This is the worst store for selling products after the best-before date.  I slipped up yesterday (June 30/15) and brought home yogurt from there that was best before May 30/15.  Normally I am very careful because of the many, many times I've seen (and removed and/or pointed out) past due products on their shelves.  I've shopped here almost every day since 1996 because of the convenient location, the GREAT staff, and the pretty fairly priced, well stocked products.  I know they'd give me a refund if I'd kept my receipt but who needs the hassle of bringing stuff back ,,, and because of a perfectly avoidable error on their part?~date. ~3
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~5WpQbKZJQZGkE-c2SU2Lcw~The only thing I like about this store is that it's open 24 hours. They have fresh butter croissants and chocolate danishes every morning. During holidays, they usually have a manager's sale.  The freshness and quality of their produce can certainly be better.~butter ~3
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~r6r_eeQ6GyYeFPxFp2lKWg~For a while, I never came here.  I didn't feel the pull; I was more familiar with other nearby grocery stores.  Fast forward to today - I now really enjoy shopping at Sobey's.  As a parent of little ones, I'm so grateful that they have this Free Fresh Fruit for Kids deal near the front entrance, by the produce.  Shopping for groceries is one of the dullest things to put a young kid through, and this treat they offer to all kids (12 and under) is a joy in keeping both myself, the kids, and fellow shoppers, happy.  The prices, in general, are fair.  Sale prices can be good!  (Love their deals on almond milk, sometimes 2 cartons for $7; or Haagen Daaz for $4.99).   Freshness is similar to what you'd expect to find.  Air Miles collectors will appreciate earning 1 point for every $20 spent.  Spending $40 or more will currently get you a receipt offering .04 cents off a litre of gas at a Shell gas station, although there's a gas station with competitively priced gas (we're talking about savings similar to that at Costco's).  We come here with our dog, put him near the large front windows, where I can shoot a glance his way as I shop.  There is a lovely woman who works within this Sobey's.  She is a true dog person with a gold heart.  I've seen her come out to say Hi to our little guy more than once.  Met her by first name today.  I love seeing this genuine, caring side in people.  There was another time where the person who was restocking on some Haagen Daaz ice cream, opened a new case of ice cream, just to provide me with a very frozen container.  It wasn't easy to get to.  This gesture was appreciated.  I'm finding that people who work here are just lovely, real people.  Nice people.  Funny how they have products that link up to famous chefs, like Jamie Oliver, and a few others (see their pesto, pasta sauce, and frozen food sections) to other chefs that are famous but that I can't think of by name right now.  Yes, I certainly will go again.  Yes, I definitely recommend for people to try this Sobey's out.  I'm into health foods, and Sobey's image is meant for mainstream types.  Still, I like passing by this place with my kids, who have good associations with this Sobey's.  Ha, as my dog probably does, too.~almond milk, ice cream, ice cream, pasta ~4
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~PaY9zEWMhz_F0tbQfzvDKA~This place is not the best. One star for being open 24 hours, one more for being reasonably clean.  Beyond that, the prices of basics are very high. I paid 4.99 for a carton of milk that is 3.63 at no frills. I paid 4.07 for an orange juice that is 2.97 at no frills.  Also, I waited in the Express Lane behind a woman who had no less than 50 items. When I went to the other lane, I encountered being behind the people who had items that wouldn't scan and also had items with no price.  Not again.~milk ~2
3TAc--QKVYb-F5Mq2NHf0g~yaAkE_mCCRRgnYu-8HlzMQ~Sobeys as a whole is a terrible company .. over priced product and poor produce.. this location I frequent out of lazy Ness as its near my house .. but their sushi gets made in the morning and it's still for sale at regular price at 4 am .. that isn't right .. a lot of expired foods at this place ..  very over priced~sushi ~1
4QBl0ksgIjdr5loP8IVMhQ~zwyPGFLCnA0D50IlGdfZSA~I go there for the coffee and the atmosphere. It is very nicely appointed and the coffee is great. Plus free wi-fi which they really don't advertise too much.~coffee coffee ~5
4QBl0ksgIjdr5loP8IVMhQ~huwCzuxOjotTMYalp5vAxA~Not the best Gelato I have had. Nope. Its okay for a hot summer day but it wasn't like I am craving it or anything. Nothing like Frost in Tucson, although they do carry the flavor Striciatella. The chocolate with hazelnut was okay, except there were hardly any hazelnuts in it. The chocolate was okay too but there were no chocolate shavings in it either....It tastes more like regular ice cream than gelato, so don't know if I care for it that much. The place is hip and cool though. The scoops are way small than Frost size servings. The owner was there and apparently they make all their stuff right on site. I asked her if she had yogurt too and she said that sometimes they make it but its so hard to make so she tends to be lazy on that part. Nice people though. Will take friends here.~ice cream ~3
4QBl0ksgIjdr5loP8IVMhQ~LA3xDGEjE4X1z-4k59fbVw~Ok I've only ever had the gelato here, although they do have a small dessert case filled with cupcakes and cake slices  However, their gelato is so good, why get anything else?  A small with two scoops is $3 Not too shabby!  My favorite flavor is strawberry with chocolate gelato.  It's like eating chocolate covered strawberries.... yum!!!~cupcakes cake ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~4bb4N2P5hx4KhINEeZRmgA~Each season my boy wait for this spot to open! They never fail us! The snow is always so fine that it literally melts in your mouth. There are so many different combinations of flavors that you can use to crest your own. You can add ice cream or cream to your snow cone as well. The employees are always happy! This place is always jamming which is always a good sign. Be sure to get your lunch card to earn your free snow cone! AMAZINGLY GOOD!~ice cream ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~0OJY8ya1wQdWlgVs_ih6qQ~This is a great little "shack" in a gas station parking lot. It's really smooth shaved ice. There is a long list of flavors, including some relatively unique ones. You can mix flavors. You can also add ice cream on the bottom. The small size is pretty big. Prices are fair. Wait isn't long. All in all, it's a tasty treat, especially on hot Vegas days.~ice cream ~4
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~zsEaURG0M2iDgSRi3hluow~This small little shack is proof that great things can come in small sizes!  The shaved ice is extremely fine!  There are over 30 flavors to choose from, and multiple flavors can be added into the same cup!  This place is extremely generous with the syrup quantity too.  Feel free to save the, "We want more!  We want more!" in this case!   Most of the flavors are on the sweet side, so if you're not a fan I suggest grabbing a sugar free flavor or a sour flavor (the word sour will be in the name).  Don't forget to add the ice cream!  The only flavor offered is vanilla, but it is delicious and compliments most flavors (sour flavors not so much)!  The ice cream is very smooth and creamy.    By the way, this little shack is located in a gas station's parking lot.  If you're planning to drive away immediately after receiving your order, I suggest asking for your choice of size served in a bigger cup.  For example, I normally have my medium serving placed in the cup meant for a large serving.  The cups normally have 2-3 inches of shaved ice stacked above the rim, so this is a good option for busy-bodies like myself.  One last note, the staff definitely deserves recognition.  Every worker that I've come across during my visits is always wearing a smile and has a goofy personality that can make anyone smile.  That can't be easy after being cooped up for hours!  Much appreciated!  Will definitely keep coming back!~ice cream! ice cream ~4
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~_dT_bL0WG6Mc3KsLrhBToQ~My hubby and I both laughed at the idea of a snow cone trailer at a gas station when we first saw it in our neighborhood, but then we started noticing the long lines every day for it & I guess you could say curiosity got the best of us. Lol we decided to take our girls and try it and boy are we glad we did!!! It is beyond yummy!! It's not your average crunchy ice syrup-ey flavor all on the bottom snow cone we had both assumed it was. These are totally different! The ice literally melts away the moment it touches your mouth. It's very soft and smooth. A ton of flavors to mix and match plus you can add cream or ice cream to change it up even more!! It's definitely are favorite summer go to dessert!! Affordable and yummy!! Definitely give it a whirl we are sure glad we did! :)~ice cream ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~nG7DBCOOuSZ99NzNn1z1Zg~I'm sorry but people who write reviews about the long lines & long waits need a reality check. This is a snow cone stand/truck at a gas station. And the fact that there is usually a long lines means that they are good!  Me & my family live in the area & stop by once a week. The ice is shaved really fine, not crushed & the prices are very reasonable. A small with ice cream & condensed milk is $4.75. And they accept cards too (iPad swiper). The ice is shave fresh, so it takes a little while for each one made. They have umbrellas to use while you wait bc they are technically a food truck & they can't have a sitting or shaded area by law (their license).   And you should be responsible for your own children in a gas station parking lot, not the workers.~ice cream & milk ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~aq99gMAwZ9mbI-ZERr73xQ~Love that they now have this location! A nice treat on the way home! The people are nice and love the punch cards! The flavors are great... Mango and piña colada yum! At first the ice was too big as I like shaved ice... But it grows on you and location, location, location!!!~mango ~4
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~JlhdB-qDaYZt0Srd5CV8Ig~My Kid loves this place and we've been here a few times since the weather turned over to the depths of hell.  Love the flavor choices and you can put ice cream in your cup along with your snowcone but the contrasting smooth ice cream and hard crunchy ice didn't work for me. (Tried to mix vanilla and their root beer for a root beer float and it didn't work)  2nd time through I just had root beer and it was delicious .   The daughter has only had Blue Rasberry and while she won't ever share with me I can speak to her Smurf blue lips and tounge when she finishes.  The only down side to the place is that they don't have ample parking or a bench to sit and eat your treats. I can trust my teenager enough not to get syrup all over the leather in my car but if you have young kids they will either be running around a parking lot amped up on Sugar or sitting in your vehicle making everything sticky.  Don't let that scare you. Its worth the risk and having to wipe down the interior of your vehicles.~ice cream ice cream ~4
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~k95R4vgmmvwEZOEzWII9UA~My youngest saw this place and said he wanted to go.  Reluctantly I said okay (I'm not a huge fan of shaved ice).  This place is wonderful and paired with 110 degrees, it's heaven in a cup.  Prices I felt were great, especially for the sizes.  A small is more than enough of a serving and $2 if you don't add in ice cream or cream.  We have gone more than a couple of times since discovering it and will be going again in the future.~ice cream ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~mK1piA0R8VKYxI6MkSm0Rg~The staff are friendly. We came at 8:30 p.m. and it's posted that they close at 8. They weren't rude about rushing you to order. My two kids ordered a small. One penguin punch topped with cream and the other one pineapple with ice cream. I got a medium strawberry and coconut topped with cream. Awesome! Better than Bahama Bucks. Cheaper and taste better. Only con is you don't have a cool place to eat it. Enjoy!~pineapple ice cream. coconut ~5
0FbFqMBLRGRRdZlGJeXjug~6TK3PtmqiY0oewS0oZGqrg~My husband and I go to the Purple Penguin every time we go to Vegas. We love this place the staff is always friendly and the snowcones are the best. The ice is finely shaved and not crushed ice.    My favorite is red velvet and birthday cake with cream and ice cream. It is like birthday in your mouth. My husbands is Tigers Blood.     The prices are very reasonable and it is so nice you can use your debt or credit card.  We love the purple penguin!!!~cake ice cream. ~5

Place is like a trip back in time - a classic 80 year old diner with mahogany panels everywhere. It's shaped so you don't feel crowded even though it's long and rectangular.  Years ago it was always too smoky but no longer thanks to smoking ban! CASH only.~coffee ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~UGC1Ah6zH20SoPmpzoOVaA~I love this place. It has that classic diner feel. The food is very good, comes out fast, and they give you a lot for the money. And speaking of money, the food is all cheap!  I usually get the breakfasts, and the corn beef hash is the best I have ever had. The other breakfast items I have tried are all great as well.~corn beef ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~fiQNev9peSqVmw2lMmdPig~John's is a fixture in Lakewood and a great place to get some home cookin'.  You'll get good basics here-eggs, burgers, BLT's, etc.  I'm less sure of fancier grub here and that holds true for diners in general.  Love the old diner feel here.  This is a classic train car style diner with the long counter and booths.  Your coffee cup will never go empty and the service is almost always fast and friendly.~burgers, coffee ~3
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~zsHmWoaYDEGojlRLKMrGVA~I thought I'd never get to 500 reviews! Now that I finally have, I thought I'd review one of my favorite types of establishments -- a no-frills diner.  My mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.  Two things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive.   My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem.   The coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.  Pretty much a great diner experience that I'll be sure to repeat in the near future!~corned beef ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~NsGVzz5RXvZwcbTvdp350g~Once again it was great! Went there for breakfast today.  Spoke to John as I always do.  What a nice guy. I have been going there 32 years. I had the "John's omelette"  with mushrooms,cheese,tomato, onion, and hash browns-excellent! My son had the "crab meat omelette" he said it was great also. I can't believe all the breakfast selections, so many omelettes. So many choices and less $$ than all the others. You like home cooking? Go to John's diner, that cozy at home feeling.~mushrooms, cheese, tomato, onion, ~5
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~G7euyZlGJyNdrP7zmY5Ulw~Ah John's.....this is a good ol' classic car diner. Much of the inside is original - booths, counter, stools, hat racks, etc. Food is good, standard diner fare. Nothing outstanding but still solid. My friend says their pancakes are the best she's ever had. I've never had them as I'm not much of a pancake eater, but she's a connoisseur so I'll take her word for it. As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints. I've never been in the bathroom, not even sure if they have one. Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...  The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there.   John's is a classic type place - looks rough on the outside, not too far behind on the inside, but will serve you up a good, hot meal quickly and cheaply.  Oh, yeah - CASH ONLY.~pancakes coffee ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~7Lg1bSgEenW64U8zJMXf5g~John's is like stepping back in time ... in all the best ways! The food is simple but well-prepared. The portions are generous. The service is friendly and attentive. And the prices, well, unbelievably easy on your wallet. Case in point: the special breakfast: 2 French toast slices (or pancakes); 2 slices bacon; 2 sausage links; and 2 eggs prepared to order ... $4.95!! I almost feel guilty ordering it. Definitively a unique place with old-fashioned values.~french toast pancakes) bacon; sausage ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~nD3h8bAWVSBetXAIOMjMEg~I'm sorry to say I only just got to John's Diner for the first time this weekend.   This is the archetype of a greasy spoon diner.  It's been around forever (apparently at least since the 1930's), is well worn, a little cramped, dirt cheap, and delicious.    We went for breakfast on a Sunday, and were really happy to find a simple, classic, menu of breakfast fare (with an option of dinner-served all day).  Eggs, meat (including country-fried steak!), pancakes, gravy, etc. - you know the drill.  Sit down, someone will take your order soon, and shortly thereafter it will arrive on some well-used dishes for you to devour.    A little while later, a bill will arrive on your table and you'll be surprised at how little your full belly cost.~steak! pancakes, ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~tjT9ehEn00wR-cCZcUdo-A~I like a restaurant that doesn't really care about me.  Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, "Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you..."  John's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, "If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door."  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, "Now, what did you want THAT for?"  As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.    The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.  Would I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.  Would I go here myself when I'm tired of exotic foods and just want a damn sandwich?  In a heartbeat.~pomegranate- bacon sandwich, sandwich? ~3
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~EuLZiYfB6ijI9R3eoUliFg~John's has the most delish corned beef hash in town!  Yeah, the coffee mugs have lipstick stains and the forks aren't the cleanest, but places like these are called "greasy spoons" for a reason.  In the words of Bart Simpson, "This ain't the Ritz."  Their staff is super friendly.  You never need to ask for coffee refills.  And they have the best, most yummy coffee creamer!  Not hazelnut, Carmel macchiato or anything frou frou.  Just a very enjoyable cup 'o joe!!~corned beef ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~i8GleQH-UqE5NGe-OL8gXw~This is the worst dining experience I've ever experienced in all my years.   It is also the weirdest dining experience I have experienced in all my years...  So I've driven by quite a few times and it struck me as a place the locals go when they've had one too many or maybe a place some of the locals frequent for a weekend hangover cure.   To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here. There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the "chef" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well.   So, anyhow, the story: Two adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal.   Let's order!  So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles.   Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat.   The soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they "of the dayified" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.  Spaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5.   The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.  While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the "chef" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the "sauce" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly.   The "chef" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it "Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out.   I sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it.   The waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out.   She asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop).  So we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new...... So I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.~spaghetti meatballs, beef meatballs soup spinach soup soup) wheat. soup soup spaghetti beef potatoes..... tea beef, meatballs egg spaghetti brown meatballs meatballs spaghetti egg brown ~1
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~TO8Y7ZbHdqEahkCHq-520A~I love diners. I love breakfast food. I love independently owned ANYTHING. In spite of John's Diner having all of these ingredients, it proved to be the perfect storm for one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my dining life.   I HATE to have to write this review, but I was so appalled that people like this place I had to protest. It was filthy (I got a coffee mug with hot-pink lipstick caked on it), outdated, muggy, falling apart, the coffee was weak and the food was cheap - in quality and price. You say no-frills. I say the setting of a horror movie right before everyone gets murdered. I left with a new desperation to take a shower. I'm so sorry, I wanted to like it.   Save yourself the discomfort and visit the real no-frills diners of lakewood: The Place to Be and The Coffee Pot.~coffee coffee coffee ~1
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~GAreW6-HH8HS7_I_ZxFiLw~I come here often. When I lived in Virginia I would come to John's diner whenever I visited my mother. You say greasy?  Then you never ate Southern food which is simple boiled or baked anything loaded with grease and/or sugar and/or salt.  John's seemed then and does now like Cleveland diner food my dad ate when he worked for the railroad.   Western sandwiches, hot roast pork on white bread with mashed potatoes and gravy, lemon meringue pie and sausage with eggs and home fries. No grits please. The fish fry every Fridays beats any I have had to line up for in a church basement during lent.   Cleveland has lost many diners such as Ruthie's and Moe's while others have glamorized such as the Clifton Diner. Thanks to whoever is keeping John's going with the same food and the simple interior and the same diner prices. Maybe lipstick on a pig fools some people but the rest of us knows a diner is a diner is a diner.~sandwiches, pork white lemon pie sausage home fries ~5
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~EMBUsiA4Im_0o-fteSrBKA~I've heard this place is amazing, but unfortunately had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. We stopped in for dinner and were the only customers in the place. They were out of the specials that were hand-written on a paper in our menus. We heard the cook complaining about how he was tired of serving terrible food. We had chicken noodle soup with no chicken in it. Food was nearly inedible. I'd be willing to try this place for breakfast, but will never be back for lunch or dinner.~chicken soup chicken ~1
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~_6i3yW-Tg5Lua-zFLAsrWA~In the midst of a cozy town is a cozy diner. This is a no frills place. Piles of food flying off the grill straight to the hungry locals.  Hungry? Try the corn beef hash, this mountain of tender beef and potatoes, topped off with a crown of eggs, will fill you up for cheap.  Coffee is hot, service is ornery, food is awesome. One star off for the facilities, they are definitely showing the age, and it bugged me a bit that the air vents were "fuzzy".~corn beef ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~T89OKCaZH_GWAUxW_uhhJQ~So my girlfriend and I walked into this... "establishment." We took a seat at the only available spot on the bar. The employee dynamic was miserable at best. They were arguing with each other in front of the customers, suggesting that they all hate each other. I watched a woman give the customer the wrong change... Probably because their cash register is from the 1920s.   The younger of the three women was yelling into the kitchen "I'm not going to serve fatty bacon. Get your shit together."   I left before they even had a chance to take my order (which was easily 10 minutes after I sat down).   I will never be coming back again. It looks like it's not just the chef that needs to get his shit together....~bacon. ~1
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~2kWNEWZwkDWkRw0X2tN8xg~Breakfast wasn't too good here , bacon kinda in edible , but the people working were really nice , my bf loved his omelette but I just didn't like mine :( my potatoe hash was so oily I mean like pizza oily .. :/~bacon pizza ~2
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~d41iKPrituOvzuJiHwkR8w~My boyfriend and I have been here a total of three times within the last 2 months. The first two times, the food was excellent, service even better. Unfortunately they only accept cash, but that's never held us back from a genuine home cooked meal.  The third time, however, wasn't the best experience. The service was prompt, friendly as ever. The food was exceptional. The omlettes were 5 bucks and came with toast. We both added hash browns for $1.25. I got coffee and orange juice. He got lemonade and $2 stuffed grape leaves (which were the worst we've ever had.) They were different, not sour, didn't taste fresh at all. Anyways, we've always loved the exceptionally low prices, especially for the quality of food here. Coffee was awesome and before I could even think about getting another cup, I noticed it was already full. They must have charged us for EVERY refill, including coffee. Because our total was $28 and some change. Most of the refills were filled without asking for them. I could barely read the receipt and the prices didn't seem accurate.  I'll definitely go back for breakfast again. I'll stay away from the grape leaves, because hey, it's a DINER, I can't really be mad. However, I WILL watch the prices and be cautious about refills. Overall, friendly breakfast spot in Lakewood.~coffee grape leaves ( coffee coffee. grape leaves, ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~WL1I0BK4uI_Up_4h7BwAzg~I love this place. Do not walk in expecting to be amazed. I guess you just need to wrap your head around exactly what John's Diner really is. Yes, there are lipstick stains on the cups from time to time, and yes, much of the menu is crossed out and rewritten in pen. The place is pushing 80 according to review from a newspaper hanging on the wall. You get what you pay for in this case, but it is charming if you are in the right mindset. It's fun.  DO NOT order dinner food, it will be gross. They serve breakfast all day, and that is what they know how to do.  Also: Their home fries are heavenly. :)~home fries ~4
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~G37cyO4gke5k5n7MokNFMA~This was the absolute most disgusting food i ever attempted to eat in my life. I would not feed this food to my dog or a stray one on the verge of death for that matter. The coffee was cold, the water had a stench and an after taste, the soup was cold but i was able to choke it down. The food was rotten! The steak which i didnt expect to be the greatest smelled rotten and tastes sour, the gravy was old lumpy and foul. I have never once went to an establishment order 4 different menu items and everyone take 2 bites get sick to their stomach and not eat. The fact that the waitress took 4 plates not even touched filled with food back and not question was beyond me. We all got sick from our 2 tasting bites and i am probably going to call the health department. I didnt even want to give this place 1 star. I would rather eat the scraps thrown into a dumpster  from a gas station then to ever go to this place again~coffee soup steak ~1
-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ~2sD89kWh9gQLOnkZEokNcQ~The only reason I did not give this place a single star is because I appreciate its history in the area and building itself is like eating in a time machine. However, the food here is just not good...and yes I have only ordered breakfast. My eggs were undercooked as was my bacon. Additionally, my coffee cup had lipstick stains on it. In the words of Dr. Evil "That's just gross." If you want to go to a real Diner in Cleveland where you can actually order anything on the menu and expect an awesome meal...Go to George's Kitchen!!!~bacon. coffee ~2
7p6tHUA1Pknh0DVWqz86lA~YEgNOZDCeLuQimfNVYC2AA~Similar experience as the other reviewer, they never showed up and didn't return our calls!  The owner (Justin) came to our house and gave us an estimate for a house cleaning, said all the right things.  We scheduled the service two weeks in advance on a specific date.  We discussed all the details of the cleaning we needed to be done.  We even discussed the possibility of using their service regularly going forward if all went well with the first cleaning.  He said he would e-mail me later to confirm the appointment and give us the estimated time of arrival.  No such e-mail ever came.  A few days before the scheduled day of cleaning, my husband started calling both the office number and the owner's direct cell phone number, and left multiple messages asking if they were still coming and requesting that they return the call to confirm.  We never received a call back, and the day came and went with no sign of a cleaning crew.  We never did hear back from them.  Unbelievably bad (or nonexistent) service... how on earth do they stay in business?  Beware of buying this company's services in advance with coupons or special deals, you will probably never get the service at all and will have wasted your money.~date. ~1
7QCi9ON3nRx6W8htg2ck-A~SSI8ACCwroMp7573yp7_-Q~The breakup was impending...I just didn't want to see it.  So I ended up canceling my services with Muse for my wedding.  I had contracted their services almost a year ago for wedding hair and makeup.  At that point they had rave reviews on wedding wire and yelp.  However, things have taken a turn for the worst in 2014 by the company, as evidenced by the other reviews on this site.  Even from the get go, I had difficulty receiving an email with the contract.  Jennifer, the owner, attributed the delay the first time to problems with the email: info@museartistrylv.com.  Eventually, we sorted that out.  Email problems happen, so I figure no big deal.  Fast forward to my engagement hair and makeup, that went off without a hitch.  So there are the two stars from my experience from August 2013 (see my other review).  So fast forward, I'm a little over a month out from my wedding. I schedule my trial hair and makeup way in advance and even send an email confirming time and date.  My trial time is 11am...I just happen to check my email while waiting for them to show up for the trial.  In my inbox is an email, sent that morning, canceling for the day since one of the artists is ill. Okay, illness happens but as a professional company and owner you need to pick up the phone and call your client. An email is not an acceptable form of cancellation. So I pick up my phone and call to see if I can reschedule, no answer on her personal cell or the company phone number.  The best part is the voicemail that states leave your info and we will get back to you in 24 hours.  I also email both emails again asking for someone to call me regarding rescheduling.  Yeah...don't count on a response in 24 hours. Fast forward 4 days later, I again send another email and leave voicemails on both numbers requesting contact.  I decide at this point to send a text message with something along the lines of please let me know if I need to start looking elsewhere for hair and makeup services.  I finally get a text message stating that her phone had died and that she would make my next appointment a priority.  Okay, I get your phone died but you clearly still have access to email since you sent me one to cancel the morning of the trial.... I follow up by asking who the artists will be for the trial, it ended up not being the same two listed on my contract.  She did sound sincere, as sincere as you can be on text message regarding the cancellation.  But after I reviewed all my email correspondence with her, this is the second time she has had problems with her iPhone.  She may indeed have very poor luck with her phone....might I suggest a land line or one not routed to your cell phone. But at this point, I had a decision to make....do I worry about being stood up on my wedding day via email or do I find peace of mind and cancel. The choice was easy, I'll consider my deposit a donation and move on.  However, I did the responsible thing in this break up.  I did try to call to cancel, but surprise no one picked up.  I also emailed and texted just to be on the safe side.  She did respond to the text.  I will tell you that IF they show up you will probably get good value for services rendered, since I shopped around and they were the lowest priced packages.  But you know lesson learned, you get what you pay for...  Brides, make an educated decision.~date. ~2
7vyH-CfCBnlCZ0XLSfKvNw~T0B3dunCbwFoTyRyKPAhyg~I had a incredibly unique shopping experience here.  It would have been about two months ago, I used to live a stone's throw away from this location and whenever I was feeling particularly lazy, or lax about spending money I would shop here.  Employees were always friendly and whenever I needed a quick feta fix or a last minute bit of cilantro for for finishing my revered spicy Thai peanut sauce this was my spot.  So as I was saying before my ramble, I experienced the ultimate in "feel good" moments here a few short months back.  I was picking up some produce and must have been shaking my head visibly at the astronomical cost of everything, when I was approached by an aisle clerk who covertly pointed me in the direction of what appeared to be a shopping cart set aside.  I thought that my eyes had deceived me. This cart was brimming with produce!  Many of the items I had in my hands were in said cart and I was informed that they would be throwing them away, but that if I wanted they may be able to sell to me at a marked discount.  I jumped at this opportunity and was actually able to buy three times what I needed at half the price.  I made a vegetable heavy pasta salad, cous cous, and vegetable noodle soup, and was super happy that I was allowed to find a home for these soon to be discarded items.  Definitely a feel good moment for both my wallet and soul.  I don't know if this act of charitable kindness was against store policy, and hope that I'm not getting someone who committed an admirable act in trouble with management, but something like this should be commended and not condemned.  This one gesture more than made up for all the over- priced items that I have bought at Sobey's over the years.  Thank you Sobey's for restoring my faith in the powers that be.~cilantro thai pasta salad ~4
3jPajTVLzeNbXRnc-qPHXg~wPUBiFKVOrnx-ueKGnFz4g~had my first visit to Effeto Donna last night - overall, it was great. I was in and out in 15 minutes and my esthetician was really great - the wax was great and actually the least painful I've had to date.   It's a small shop and the atmosphere is a not as nice as other spas that I've been to, but overall I would recommend Effeto Donna as convenient, cost efficient and quality place for waxing.~date. ~4
29Z_lTBAAPNifXBpSX5esA~k6NmoHo_JrUGp3YHfIuXXw~Nice resto, decent food. I tried the creole spring roll, the jerk chicken and the goat. Tasty and doesnt break the bank.~chicken ~4
6g_sZWqPObIfmC3Hp7wCqA~sMwafwUgNJo0Kb5pzKG2uw~Mediocre. The place was empty when I arrived. The only other people who showed up were easily over the age of 65. I immediately decided not to ask to get my hair dyed. Probably should have left at that point.  Asked for long layers and only a little taken off. Despite the hairstylist saying "we will just take a little off and keep it long" multiple times during the hair cut - I still left with 5-6 inches off. I wanted long layers and apperantly to the stylist that meant only for two strands in the front. I kind of look like a school girl whose mom cut her hair. On top of all of this, the hair washing portion sucked. I look forward to having someone else washing my hair whenever I get a cut and this was nothing to write home about.   Overall, I won't be returning. I would suggest coming if you are an older person. Gloria was a very nice person but clearly is not up to date with with what people under 60 want.~date ~3
0xGNmy8DERwwqO3V5jNR6Q~Cox7cLkNc9JeUh3jeNDXnQ~The Jacobite cruisers are a great way to see Loch Ness. There are a variety of different boats with varying lengths of cruise and therefore different prices to suit your budget or time constraints. The majority of the boats also have a small bar selling tea, coffee, beer etc. The cruise is also a great way to find out a bit more about the Loch and it's geology and history.~tea, coffee, ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~9wKT-mGNW8OjUI1KQkmF8A~Breakfast for lunch and lunch for late breakfast....my kinda place!! From salads, sandwiches to bagels....I love it on weekends to sit outside when I have time to lounge. I love that I can bring Max to sit outside with me! Casual, clean and yummy!~salads, sandwiches ~5
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~R8p53pz7g2eT9j1QPR87SQ~Kashman's is the go-to deli of choice for my family.  My parents own a home between the two locations and when they are in town, we are frequent visitors to both.  I enjoy both breakfast and lunch at Kashman's.  I've never had a bad meal... omelets, oatmeal, bagels, sandwiches, salads, etc... it's all delicious!  When I'm in need of a pick-me-up, I head to Kashman's.  Their chicken noodle soup combined with a power bagel and cream cheese does the job.  There is something about the combination of carbs, fluid, protein, and dairy; it's better than what my grandmother used to make me!  But don't take my word for it; go check it out yourself!~sandwiches, salads, chicken soup cream cheese ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~dp3hxyik_M2Zq4gXp-loMA~Just realized that I wrote a review for the Kashman's location at the Summit, but not for this (Pinnacle Peak) location yet... and this is the one I frequent!  I am a regular customer at Kashman's and although I feel like it's kind of expensive, I love their food, so it's worth it to me!  Today I had the chopped farmers salad (no cheese + turkey).  I love that it is full with veggies and the light balsamic dressing they use goes perfectly with it!    Other menu items that I order consistently are the omelettes (they do egg whites no problem), oatmeal, trifecta plate, turkey sandwich, and tuna melt.  The bagels are the best I've had in Arizona, and my friend DeDe swears by their matzah ball soup!  I witnessed an interesting scenario when I was there today... a guy had bought lunch for his wife and came up to the register when I was paying and said: "Excuse me... my wife changed her mind and does not like her cookie and she wants to exchange it for a blueberry muffin."    Nancy, the owner, looked at him and apologetically said "I'm sorry, sir - that is the cookie she chose and I cannot serve that cookie to anyone else now.  You can buy a blueberry muffin if you'd like."  This made me think two things: 1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that but 2 - perhaps they should have asked if the cookie was bad, etc... and maybe even done so much as to give them a muffin to make them happy?  Anyways, that's my story for the day, but I have been and will continue to be a loyal Kashman's customer!~salad ( cheese egg sandwich, tuna soup! ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~jFvGIi3I1N7t2JMsJ919Vg~Kashman's has great food but you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter.  This is not a good place to place your order by phone. They're always nasty and short with you on the phone and then when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order.  The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average. If you're looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there, then Kashman's is your place to eat!!~artichoke ~3
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~aWglHyEupzz0LUhn-5opfA~kashman's tuna melt the best EVER. Have it on a cinnamon raisin bagel, I know it sounds nasty but it's delicious! Kashma's service is great and well worth the trip. Just remember they close by 3pm on the weekends and perhaps during the week as well.~tuna raisin ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~AcQj--N35xclRUu6W86AAw~A fantastic breakfast/deli joint located in a strip mall (isn't everything here though?). Great selection of hot and cold sandwiches, scrambles, salads, and real bagels. My personal favorite: the Trifecta Salad Sampler, with a scoop of tuna salad, to die for egg salad, and chicken salad on a bed of romaine, with freshly sliced cucumber, avocado and tomato. Get in line, order, grab a table and enjoy the hustle and bustle atmosphere.~sandwiches, salads, salad tuna salad, egg salad, chicken salad romaine, cucumber, avocado tomato. ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~PMifVP0giZ1NY12H5Z9yDQ~I really am a fan of Kashman's Place, unfortunately I don't live in the neighborhood anymore or I'd probably make it a daily stop.  I swear that they have some of the best bagels that I've had in the valley- their jalapeno bagel hits the spot! So does their bagel sandwich for a quick on the run meal. I was also a big fan of and can recommend the Thanksgiving Cranberry Turkey and Sonoran Chicken sandwiches. Everything that I've had at either location was top-notch... if only they had a CenPho location.~jalapeno sandwich cranberry chicken sandwiches. ~4
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~3MQb61Fy7ToQTMwjYdm9iQ~I had high hopes for this place. It's only two strip malls away from my parents' hood (since I'm a visitor and didn't keep track of actual distances, and there are strip malls galore in this area, that's how I keep tabs on locations), and it's a Jewish-sounding deli! Sign me up...  Three of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special.   This rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable, but really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich. I'd rather pick up fixings and make my own at this cost, which is what I did the next day.~sandwiches. chicken salad sandwich. chicken. beef sandwich cheese salad sandwich ( cranberry wheat, salad. sandwich. ~3
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~wSaEe0ddw3WgZGgW4D0RrA~Cute little place to go for breakfast on the weekend.  Food was good but I felt it to be a little over priced for a place that does not serve you.    In my opinion, I found Kashman's to be very overpriced for breakfast, and I found it to be the same quality as The Good Egg but way to over priced.~egg ~2
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~Od1t0XzP87Tzdx9a6-YYOw~Pros = Above average deli food, pet friendly, fills the need for Jewish food in this part of the Valley Cons = Overpriced, too-hot coffee, slow service at times  Somewhat strangely, Kashman's has 2 locations off Scottsdale road within about 2 miles of each other.  This would make sense if the food was stellar and the prices were reasonable, but considering neither of those points are true this fact will remain a mystery...~coffee, ~3
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~RTMipCTqOlSkPtMy0zCujg~Kashman's is North Scottsdale's best-kept open secret, something that many people living in the depths of Central Phoenix have never heard of and would never deign schlepping to for breakfast.  We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.  Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.  It can be difficult to peruse the large menu, so it may help to grab a paper copy before queuing up.~egg salads ( pastries ~5
7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q~ppcAl-LEAV5Ze2MD73DnGA~After being on our list for awhile, we finally made it out to Kashman's this week for breakfast (on a week day).  I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...  We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.    Kashman's get a solid four stars, and I'd probably go more often if it was a little more convenient for me, though I have a couple of relatives who I would consider making the drive out here for.~coffee french toast. coffee milk. coffee french toast ( cream cheese ~4

I had to pull up and wait for my drink. Then they forgot about me. I had to go inside and ask for it. What the hell. That's what I get for cheating on my diet.~fries coke. ~1

Sandwich was made to order - hot and delicious! The cheese was melted just right, the tartar sauce was perfect, and the bun was soft and fresh.  Hit the spot!~sandwich sandwich cheese ~4
1acwsRJ7tcR2KROVNeUsPQ~saZ-8Dyx89gyN9x-5qn9hQ~A friend and I ate here yesterday (5/13/09) and instantly fell in love.  The decor and table settings are extremely charming.  The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists.  My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint!   I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce.  My meal was delicious! In fact, I have been thinking about it all day.    All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package).  The only gripe I had was that my turkey pita was served in a tortilla NOT a pita.  For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing.  I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant.  The price of my turkey wrap was $8.50 and the drink was $2.50. About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant.  I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu.  I highly recommend this place!~tomato pita french fries ~4
1acwsRJ7tcR2KROVNeUsPQ~R1NunWSe4whmql-qsVlDUw~Went to Maddi's for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious.  Started with a cup of good coffee and yummy fried green tomatoes.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally got to place our order.  I had the Portabello Wrap, which was well cooked, but over-mustard-ed.  The spicy mustard took over the sandwich and kind of killed my tastebuds a bit.  My dining partners had an omelet and gumbo (reviewed favorably), the fried green tomato BLT (which disappeared off the plate quickly enough to indicate its deliciousness) and the "Birkdale Breakfast" (which was on par, but not fantastic).  Assuming the wait for our waiter was not a regular thing, but a fluke of the day, I'd recommend this place for a delicious, "new southern" brunch.~coffee sandwich gumbo ( tomato ~4
1acwsRJ7tcR2KROVNeUsPQ~O1XaYVGsWNxCFw-bz4qhYg~Maddi's is a cool, quirky find. All of the dinnerware and glassware are handmade, which really adds to the charm. We have been there many times for dinner, and brunch is also good. They also serve these delicious sweet potato muffins with both brunch and dinner that are to die for. However, we have noticed that Maddi's has declined over the last couple of months.  During our latest visit, the shrimp with grits was truly tasteless - there was no seasoning in the dish!  On two occasions, they have been unable to make martinis because they were out of alcohol.  What?!  The fried chicken, while still tasty, has shrunk in portion size.  Their soups are ALWAYS so thick it's like eating sludge.  However, we still go back because some dishes are consistently good (like the filet mignon or the fried green tomato sandwich).  If you want southern cooking, I would suggest giving Maddi's a try, just don't expect perfection.~sweet potato ~3
1acwsRJ7tcR2KROVNeUsPQ~SG8BQLbRVLC-odw0YSdpJA~I am not really sure where to start on this one:  the service was mixed.  The lady waitresses were fantastic--they knew their stuff, and were kind and engaging.  The men of the house were awful in every sense: sassy, lazy, rude, bad servers and poor drink mixers. (When I pointed out that he had substituted 2 ingredients in a drink and was missing a third, he said "yeah...we don't have the right stuff anymore."  When I pointed to it on shelf behind him, he just walked away.)  We have gone twice in the past week, and both times the food was pretty blah.  It was oversalted (and I LOVE salt!), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark.  For example, the mac and cheese was insanely soggy, the fried chicken was dry and the french toast with apples had tough, unpeeled apples inside, and already had the syrup poured on top when it arrived at the table. Who does that?  I was excited to try this place after all the goods reviews, but after going twice and experiencing the same problems both times, I would say that they have either gotten lazy or had a change of staff.  Yes, the art can be a bit charming, but most of it was just plain tackiness disguised as cuteness.  Highly NOT recommended, especially for the money.~mac and cheese ~2
1acwsRJ7tcR2KROVNeUsPQ~0EP_pfWrJMCmo3NUj2702g~Really outstanding food....this is a restaurant first and gallery 2nd.  I found the "art" really tacky to be honest, but the cuisine is phenomenal.  I thought the menu lacked a little bit of creativity and selection, but the execution was perfect.  The fried chicken was absolutely perfect.  I would strongly recommend reservations for this place...they turn the tables over very slowly and it is a small restaurant.~fried chicken ~4
0IPTFesIRB3VQs3cRz_SnA~DS_jxAf4qN_-mFCHpjN-jw~The new owners are great and the smoothies are amazing! An awesome environment, too! It is a meal replacement with both a tea and protein shake. The people who work there are very knowledgable on the product and are always willing to help people create a more healthy and active lifestyle.~smoothies tea ~5
0IPTFesIRB3VQs3cRz_SnA~TcrnSFQhrrAYUx3D_2Kj9A~I love going to the place.  Love starting my day here.  The shakes are yummy and can keep me going and the green tea with a touch of aloe mango, is great too.    This is not a turnkey in and out place, because each shake is made individually to the 30 or more flavors they have, and along the way while waiting the neighborhood folks are nice, and hey, it's kind of nice to meet our neighbors with like minds once in awhile.   They are very upfront that they are Herbalife folks, no secrets it's all over the walls, but it is not a pitchy place.  You ask if you are interested, if not, come get a shake and meet your neighbor.  Highly recommend it.  I take all my friends visiting here.    New owners, Jamie and Jay are great, (and we'll miss Clint & Nadine who were great too)  Good luck to the new owners, I think it's an awesome place.    My only complaint, I'd love it if they were open later in the day or on Sundays.  But if that's the worst, you want them open longer...that's still okay.  Worth waking up to!~tea mango, ~5
0IPTFesIRB3VQs3cRz_SnA~BQ96wfvtGWRP0rvVIg8-HQ~Before I stopped in, I didn't know what a Wellness Club was, but I must say, I like it! Like many people, I want to feel good, and not get depressed when I get dressed. Also, like many people, the whole concept of how to achieve this remains a mystery.  I do work out, but admit I get overwhelmed when I'm in a rush, need to eat, but don't have time to figure out if I am going to regret what I chose. But I think this place has the right idea of demystifying nutrition!  They have every flavor smoothie imaginable, (carrot cake, cookies and cream, chocolate, etc.) and they're 250 calories or less. I loved the carrot cake! It was delicious!  I also tried the peach aloe tea, and it was very refreshing. There are tables and chairs inside to hang out, *Free* bootcamp posters on the wall, (offering 3 classes a week outdoor at 56th st and Sweetwater) and everyone was so friendly! I will definitely be back soon!~smoothie carrot cake, cookies carrot cake! peach tea, ~5

It's hard to go anywhere when the people that work there obviously don't give a flip about their jobs or doing them well.  Have some pride in what you do even if it's not the end-all-be-all of your existence.    I will drive quickly past this Taco Bell to get to a better one.~taco bell. taco bell, taco bell ~1
6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg~CG60j_o1lfxD6aTLWkaM4g~I'm a definite fan of this Taco Bell, in fact... I secretly drive past one Taco Bell to go to this one.  I don't know if it is the newness of the building or the shopping complex it is in, but I've always had good experiences at this Taco Bell as opposed to the one closer to my house.  Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern.  My one complaint is that in their attempt to make the interior "modern" the front register ended up with a curved metal railing that makes forming a line a bit confusing.  Not that there is ever a huge line here (which is also a plus), but it makes for a free for all if you happen to arrive at the same time as someone else.~taco bell, taco bell taco bell ~4
6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg~wWXyh9uu4KBkosfJwL9-uw~Ah, Taco Bell.  This location is the closest to our house, yet for some reason it's probably the one we get to the least frequently.  They are also one of the nicer locations around, because it was built from the ground up.  Rather than the old-style mission look, it's a rectangular building, with a modern look on the inside.  It's actually a nice place.  The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well.  They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating.  It's nice and appealing.  Sweet Tea Report: What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea.  I don't know what it is, but this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte.  Definitely any fast food restaurant, but maybe any restaurant at all.  It's that good.  Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad.  Best of luck.  I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea, but trust me on this one.  Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea.  Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea, but for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch).  And yes, I reviewed Taco Bell for #550.  How lame is that?~taco bell. tea tea. taco bell tea tea taco bell chicken tea, taco bell - taco bell - tea. peach tea, tea, taco bell ~3
6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg~F7CIGwNMXT9P4cFqDUiVkA~This place really does suck!  It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line. Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most. Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road.   To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible!! Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it. Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean. Because of that I'm scared to even go into the bathrooms.   If there was another Taco Bell around Id never go to this one again.~taco bell taco bell ~1
6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg~hsBFtkKSVNRrpCVgTWartw~This place is absolutely terrible! They got my order wrong I get home the Sierra mist had no syrup in it they wouldn't replace my drink and they forgot half of my order! I get home and call Taco Bell and they refuse to replace the food that they forgot to put in my bag unless I bring back the whole order! I explained to her this is not my fault like hell am I going to have food here and not eat it right now I'm hungry that is the point of drive-through and she hung up on me. I should've got her name so that I can talk shit about her on here. I will never go back to this place it is nothing but hood rats!~taco bell ~1
6nnI3DfHn-DTd6tWnZu7Jg~H6CKBcjhwLcv8-r9Z7Uqhw~Taco Bell is definitely my favorite fast food and out of all the locations that I go to I would have to say that this is my favorite the staff is always friendly and the managers always take their time to say hello~taco bell ~5
BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg~wT-4ZdSIaPOfh5dfi2OZ4A~Want a lot of food for not a lot of money? Come here! My friend and I were looking for lunch around 2 O'clock and stumbled upon Indian Flavour. It is right in the downtown core and hard to miss with it's huge red, vertical sign. It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet.   Come lunchtime, the best option is the buffet for 10 dollars and change. For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me. Anywho, to the buffet! The salad selection is pretty miniscule. I didn't even try anything on it because they looked a bit left out. The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this.   I applaud the order of the line-up of food. Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate. The food is ok at best. Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce. We ordered more naan bread and were not charged. I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese. The rest, and we tried a lot more, I don't really remember which is telling. Despite this, we still went for two rounds of food, learning from our mistakes and left feeling very full. Meh.~salad onion butter chicken chicken lamb lamb spinach cheese. ~2
BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg~Jp2gKUlJsIGvVl30nLx0RA~Hindsight is always 20/20, but it doesn't make it less true that Indian Flavour should never have moved out of its heavily trafficked Atrium location to it's dingy current second floor digs a mere block away.   Visiting on a late afternoon (about the same time I always used to frequent when I was at Ryerson), I found the large dining room almost completely empty. The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me.   Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet.   While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait. Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again.~paneer butter chicken) ~2
BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg~KyG2WfRAkyZltNXIkaWwFw~We should have known when we walked in to Indian Flavour at dinner time to find it deserted except for one lonely table by the window.  It's just early, we said, sitting down and ordering the buffet.    My water glass is spotted and stained.  My partner finds unidentified substance in his water.  Still, we shoulder on, convinced that we are getting a deal at $13.95 for dinner buffet.    Our hopes for the food were dashed.  Most of the selection at the buffet was uninspired.  Grease and salt were the prime ingredients as every dish was coated with oil and salty beyond belief.  It was so bad that I had to push myself to have a second plate, and didn't even bother to try their rice pudding dessert.    At least I didn't overeat at this buffet.  There are many good Indian buffets in town, and Indian Flavour is certainly not one of them.~rice pudding ~1
BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg~Ot8uJ4wIT5jCECqilp3wJQ~Well-meaning but understaffed. I got to check out the dinner buffet where one waitress had to take care of all of several tables. The kitchen was having a hard time keeping up with the food supplies. They ran out of Naan pretty frequently but the waitress had us in mind and always saved a few for us. The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing but chicken. The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too but the butter chicken was decent. As far as dessert goes, the Gulab Jamon was good but the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop. I'd say come only if you need to fix your Indian food craving.~lamb chicken. tandoori chicken ~2
7uOHwheovXPvsFsrtEZUcw~ktpaSvVWG7tXER1JwO8Kbg~The Edge Festival has, since 2008, taken over from T on the Fringe and has cemented itself as Edinburgh's number one music festival! I loved T on the Fringe where I saw one of the best gigs I have ever seen in my life - The Raconteurs at the Corn Exchange!   Across August, bands and solo artists play at a number of small and larger venues in Edinburgh. Normally gigs are played at the Corn Exchange, the HMV Picturehouse, the Liquid Room, Cabaret Voltaire and the Queens Hall, but there are other much more intimate venues.   Edinburgh is absolutely buzzing in August with the festival season, and the Edge Festival manages to add to the already brilliant festival scene. The festival manages to fill the line up with major chart topping acts, with indie bands and new upcoming bands.   A brilliant music festival, however it is sadly probably overlooked currently due to the fact that it does not have the same name recognition as T on the Fringe. But who cares about the name!   Good gigs, good venues....good experience! Give it a shot!~corn corn ~4
2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA~eP5ztg3TlT_VWr6ZhGmxwQ~In my mind, I'm a great fan of Lush, but when it comes down to it, I'm constantly questioning the point of half of their products.  Is there really a point in all these bath balls, and moisturizers you've got to rub on your skin like a stone until they melt? I've spent an hour or so at Lush, and the only thing that makes sense to me are their moisturizers. I'm a great fan of their Dream Cream, and it was a sad day when a quarter of it was confiscated at the airport.   What Lush does have going for it, however, is the lack of unnecessary chemical ingredients. They're a great proponent of natural ingredients, and you'll find cocoa butter, almond oil, and shea butter in many of their products. Additionally, the smell can be quite alluring, but once you're actually in a Lush store, it's a little bit overwhelming!   If getting down to the Ocean Drive is a little too much of a hassle, there's a Lush store on Princes Street and all you have to do is smell you way there, seriously.~butter, almond butter ~3
2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA~myyRcBmFbAwe4jqwtqsFeg~I've been to both Lush's in Edinburgh and they have a different vibe. The Princes Street store is in an old building, with cornices. The Lush store in Ocean Terminal, however, is part of the state-of-the art shopping mall that was built right at the edge of the sea. Ocean Terminal is unlike any other mall I've been to- most mall's have limited views of outdoor scenery. At Ocean Terminal, however, there is a huge three story window that shows unparalleled views of the Forth. There is a Lush in this mall that is a little bit smaller than the Princes Street location- but this makes for a cozy atmosphere in the most unlikely of places- a mall! This is the Lush to go to when it is absolutely raining buckets on a winter's day. You can stroll around the mall contentedly safe and dry from the elements! The Lush Handmade Cosmetics company is one of my favourite companies in the world! They offer fun, and 'out-of-the-box' products that yo are tempted to try in the store. The smell of the essential oils and perfumes is intoxicating. The company has a quirky sense of humour- thus the names of some products: Sex Bomb (a jasmine bath bomb), Sonic Death Monkey (a chocolate and coffee (!) shower gel), You Snap the Whip ( a blackcurrent body scrub). The other thing about the company is that they are 100% ethical- they don't test on animals, and they use natural products. The store has to be seen by one and all as it will change your perspective on shops. And for anyone whose ever played Candyland or enjoyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (either movie, Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp) this is the closest you'll come to it in real life- just don't eat the soap! In addition, the store puts out a newsletter which is absolutely free and is a really good read in and of itself. The sales assistants are all helpful and each one is a bit of a character- it doesn't seem like they are vultures or just after you for your money. They seem to want to help and they also seem like they are having fun at their work. They dance along to music and cut huge pieces of soap, I've even seen one sales assisstant throw a bunch of jelly soap at a window to watch it trail down- just because! She said she loved that she got paid to do this! I love this store and this mall in general. The #22 bus is frequent, there's always one waiting outside, and the #35, #34, #11, and #1 also have stops at Ocean Terminal.~jasmine coffee ( ~5
2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA~G375O0ueUAGJzd36XQ80fg~Once upon a time, there was this chain of shops that I despised. I'd never been in one. But the smell. Oh, that smell which infiltrated and hijacked the senses of any passers by (even those going nowhere near the shop and taking active detours to skirt it) was enough to give you a headache. Not just a headache, but you could actually taste it. Perfume. Floweriness. Too intense. It made me feel sick. Urgh.    Fast forward a few years. I'm on one of my eco-friendly stints and looking for a 'shampoo bar' of all things. Yes, doing away with plastic bottles and buying the shampoo equivalent of a bar of soap seemed like a great idea. But where to buy one? An internet search took me all around the houses of a lot of online retailers, and then I stumbled across Lush. Ah haa, she thinksthere's one of those just along the road from me so I could just nip in and pick one up! Sure, there's the smellbut if I can hold my nose long enough?    That was it. My first Lush encounter. I walked into the shop, and it was love.    The bars of soap laid out in the centre of the shop looked like cakes - I swear, I could have eaten them had somebody sliced me a bit off. Some of them certainly smell good enough to eat, and we're not just talking about that flowery smellbut cocoa and vanilla and coconut andand Yes, whatever did happen to that overpowering wall of floral aroma that I always used to associate with Lush? Well, either I've acclimatised myself to it, or it was psychological in the first place and nowhere near as bad as I'd remembered it being. And realistically, now that I understand the way the shop worksthey're not all about plastic packaging and bottles and the rest - sure, some of the products 'have' to be packaged like that - but they believe in minimal packaging and little paper bagsso of course all of the aromas are going to be mingling, merging and overpoweringthey're not all sealed into bottles!    On the whole, Lush is a rather ethical retailer. Their products are 'mostly' natural, but a few do contain the odd synthetic ingredient. They're all nicely labelled however, so it's easy to make a clear, conscious decision over what you're buying. It's also nice to see that Lush are reducing the amount of products they sell containing SLS tooit's something I try to avoid whenever possible.    The Lush staff in Ocean Terminal are amazingly helpful. They will immediately acknowledge you when you walk into the shop and offer to help. Yes, I know this can be annoying in other shops when you want to be left alone, but it's not at all intimidating in here. If you're just browsing, then say so and they'll give you all the space you need. But as soon as you get stuck over which product to choose (and you will, because there are so many delicious products to choose from), you need only to glance in their direction and they'll be straight over to give you all the help you need. I've spent a good extra half hour or so in this shop at times, just because I'm busy chatting away happily to the assistants about various different products and the different ways they can be used - they're as interested in hearing feedback from the customer as they are in handing out the advice themselves! It's nice to see they're so passionate about what they're selling. They'll frequently give you a little sample tub of something if you're just wanting to test a product out, and I virtually always walk away from the shop with a few extra little bits and pieces that they've thrown in my bag as freebies anyway. Plus, I always walk away with a smile on my face. Yes, my pocket's always that little bit lighter than I expected because I saw something new that I just HAD to try (even though it wasn't on my shopping list), but I'm beaming with excitement over my little bag of goodies and can't wait to get home and try everything out. It's sad, but this shop really does do this to me!    Finallydon't expect to walk in and buy your 'usual' style of toiletries. Go in with an open mind and embrace it. We're talking shampoos in bar form, facial cleansers which look like rolls of sushi, deodorants in a putty type form which you take a pinch of and smear on, body moisturisers which come in bars that you take into a hot shower and smear all over you, tubs of shower jellyyes that's 'jelly' rather than gelall very unconventional, but WAY more exciting to try.    Lush really is my favourite shop. And Lush at Ocean Terminal is where I feel at home - it was this shop which converted me, well and truly. I can't believe that I avoided Lush for all of those years. It was me who missed out though - I realise that now!~coconut sushi, ~5
2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA~q-uyn30Cx7jQtuz2gppLNA~Sales assistants are very helpful and friendly. You will smell this shop long before you actually reach the front door. Some people it will entice, others is will scare off.    The products are lovely, not irritating, not expensive. There are face masks made with fresh produce - they have a sell by date about a week later, they are wonderful but you do need to remember to put them in the fridge and use them up before they go off. Bath bombs are fun to use, it's great watching one fizz away in your bath, they come in so many different flavours - every one smells great.~date ~3
2qBxM_3i18ppnAIEkoRUzA~qmLLxSAr5j9sR8HXgIGQBQ~After moaning about Lush in pretty much every other Lush review I've ever done, I found myself caving in and heading in here for a birthday present last week. It wasn't such a cop out as my friend had specifically asked for Lush treats as it's her favourite store. I ended up getting her a selection of goodies including a soap that smelled like fudge, a honey smelling soap and a couple of bath bombs. They were beautifully wrapped up in a box and looked much better than I could have done! As I'm not a great fan of Lush I fail to see the fascination my friend has with it, but I did receive excellent customer service by the friendly staff here. I got what I came in for and left a happy bunny.  I have to admit, it does smell great but I wonder if the shop assistants are haunted by the smell wherever they go. It must play havoc with the old sinuses. There are worse smelling smells to be haunted by though...  HOT TIP: If you're in any Lush branch and feeling a little low, give the bath jelly a good slap, guaranteed to cheer you up.~honey ~4
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~oatQfQpnQJa6XN7wrVkisw~Great burger, especially for a Food Court.   First they have Great Burger, and the right balance between al-carte and signature burgers.  Second, good fries Third, options, but not too many that would cause frustration.  Such as Salads, these are real salads, it you want to be a little be healthy.

Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~jxP0HqXZzP_8h8enKYBJ1g~I went there as I heard they serve Halal burgers...well I was there to check it out today. Firstly they charge about a $1.25 for a halal patty. They do have beef and chicken patty. We were two so we ordered one each. We ordered the Big smoke burger and Spicy chicken burger.   Lets start with the taste, the beef tasted ok... I have had better but their chicken tasted good.  The patties were good but the bun was too thin to hold the burger together. Both burgers were cooked properly and were still juicy, they also put sauteed onions on top which help out as they put a tiny bit of lettuce leaf. The fries were to die for they tasted smokey and were very enjoyable.   All in all its a decent joint to have a burger and enjoy some food.~burgers... patty. beef chicken patty. burger chicken burger. beef chicken burger burgers lettuce fries burger ~3
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~npA2IkNwl6QzzECd65irog~Went here just to say I tried it, since I'd never been to one before and this is a new location. I just had a hamburger. They are very cheap with the condiments, all I had was mustard and ketchup on my burger and there was barely any on it. Luckily I waited until I was home to eat and just added more to my liking. McDonald's puts more on their burgers than this place did, and that's saying something! I was not asked how I would like it cooked and that is probably why it was ' well done' . I normally like my burgers medium to medium-well and this burger had no pink whatsoever.  I did not get anything else during this visit because I knew I was going to eat at home.  Fries don't normally travel well.   I will go back again in the hopes that this was just an opening week glitch on the time they need to cook their burgers. Plus, I have to try their poutine at least once. :)~hamburger. burger burgers burgers burger fries burgers. ~2
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~58lrhCoxfbKXlDuygKLUYg~Oh man. This is such a disappointing review for me to write. I love Big Smoke Burger on Yonge Street. I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto.   So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, "Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please." I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing.   I also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, "Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!"   Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, "It's a spicy," so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.  What did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty.   The Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat.~burger burger burger patty patty patty patty patty patty patty burger patty. burgers burger burger patty. ~1
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~V0wZgSD3-8B8x1LNBKZAPQ~Stopped At square one after work and noticed  they were Doing renovations in the food court. Decided to try something new and walked over to big smoke burger. The menu had a wide range of topping combinations but I settled for a regular cheese burger and side poutine  to see if they could impress me with the basics. My combo came up to 12 dollars with a fountain ginger ale.    I must admit I was impressed. There were Actually char marks on my burger and I could taste the smokey flavour. The ingredients tastes fresh and paired together nicely. I actually found for once in my life there was more burger than bun. I didn't have high expectations for my poutine but it was delicious.  They use real cheese curds and it tasted like a beef base gravy. I will definitely be back to try one of their more gourmet burgers and a side poutpout~burger. cheese burger ~4

Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~W1LXnJEsavjC4A-ZRcSDZg~I used to come here a lot when they first opened, ordering the classic chicken burger. It's pretty good. Expensive for a burger ($9) but it was freshly made in front of you. Last time I was here, i had the most unprofessional service. I waited 30 minutes for a burger that they forgot about. When I kept asking where my burger was they kept saying it was next (but they just put the chicken on the grill. After 30 minute and about 5-7 people getting their food ahead of me I asked for my money back. I couldn't wait longer, and had to return to work. They literally threw my money back at me and whipped the burger in the trash. All done by the manager. I will NEVER be back here after this experience.  Maybe at another mall but not square one   Food 4/5 Management/Experience 0/5 Price 2/5~chicken burger. burger ( burger burger chicken burger ~2
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~kxHADMnuphzK9Cw5Z__gYQ~Ordered the organic burger because for some reason, I'm super into organic food this week. One of my weird weeks (I usually go healthy, unhealthy, Asian, salad and soup and only have one of those for the entire week).  Not sure why I do that.  Anywho, I digress.    The burger tasted good and had an okay bun - slighty soft, but it wasn't anything special.  As for the beef itself, it was juicy, but didn't have too much flavour.  I can say it's better than McDonald's and BK, but I think Lick's is better.  It was almost $11 for the burger and a ginger ale, which is kind of pricey.  However, I don't mind trying new things. Also, even though this was a fast food joint, the service was good.  They said it would take 7 minutes and being the nerd I am, I timed it and it took less than 4.    Love the fact that they give you a heads up.  Not bad burger, but not awesome.~burger salad soup burger beef burger ginger burger, ~3
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~DXfwvRNTBgr6c0g4w6nqQA~Big smoke alright! Nothing special just expensive, better off going to mcds, burger king. Def more affordable & decent selection. Highly not recommended.~burger ~1
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~p4c9bfmXEv17Zcu78xAZrQ~Came here for Yelp's Burger Binge.  Big Smoke was supposed to offer a $5 Spicy Yelp Burger, but instead they served me a Classic/Regular Burger.  I didn't check the special on the Yelp site prior to ordering, so I didn't realise that they changed it up until I got home and reread the special.  :(  So not really impressed by this bait 'n switch!  I asked how much it was to make it a combo (fries + drink) and it was almost +$5 extra.  So there has been a definite price increase since my last visit.  No thanks.  Burger didn't taste any different than the other chains, Burger King/McD's/etc. so I can live without dining here again.~burger burger, burger. fries burger burger ~2

Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~wXyoLRTLSfyAGkxuN8bm6A~Hmmmm so after coming to square one for the first time this place definitely caught my eye! So second time going to square one I definitely came here!   I got the classic* big smoke burger as recommended by the employee there. The fries here are so good! Reminded me of nyc fries but better!   So I love a nice juicy burger that maintain shape for as long as it can haha. At first this burger maintained shape. Roughly 3 bites till finish it becomes quite sloppy which is OK for me since the middle is all gone. The meat was amazing the bun was grilled, sweet onions, some kind of exotic cheese I don't know how to spell or remember and a tomato that didn't come out on first bite. Oh man it was quite a nice burger haha.   Definitely will come back to try another!~burger fries fries burger burger cheese tomato burger ~4
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~0elJjVbiNkRzPyweh1v2tw~Great burger - have tried organic and lamb.  Great fries.  I'm impatient but found them well organized and wait wasn't too long.  Would eat more often, however, only downside is it is in Square One so cannot drive up and take out - have to eat there.  They should open up an outside location in Mississauga.  We need more quality gourmet burger places/options.~burger - lamb. fries. burger ~4
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~iJDqYn6v8KC1hfP7JubM3Q~I really enjoy this place and it is my favorite of the chain burgers. Never had anything but a delicious juicy patty made the way I want. My only complaint is the price; $10 for a 4oz cheeseburher and a root beer or $15 for a combo is crazy but then again everywhere seems to be raising their prices lately so I guess it's to be expected.  Would be nice of they offered some low cost specials. The fries are good and thick, but the onion rings had too much seasoning and I found it hard to eat more than a couple.  Still though, I can appreciate the fresh patties(taste like my old man used to make on the bbq, but none of the swearing when the propane runs out) and that keeps me coming back~burgers. patty fries onion rings ~4
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~Oob99w8ubS3FX-tG12-c0w~The only reason why big smoke deserves 4 stars is because of their poutine. Absolutely AMAZING & DELICIOUS. I used to go to south st. For their poutines but glad I stopped going there because big smokes' poutines are 10x better mainly for 2 reasons: 1. Bigger size and cheaper than south st. Their small at B.S is like eating a large at south street for a dollar less. Awesome! :) 2. They give you more cheese curds without having to ask. ( who doesn't love cheese :p)   As for their burgers... Well they are not the greatest. They taste like a boxed burger but with the price of a gourmet burger. Umm no thanks. I prefer south street..~cheese cheese burgers... burger burger. ~4
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~nEv1tldtkWuXbRZpGPISVw~Big Smoke made big promises, and the resounding opinion from me was... "It's alright, I guess."  I'll save my opinion/review of the Square One revitalized food court (spoiler: it's amazing) for another time, but I did want to comment on Big Smoke, as I visited the mall recently and stopped here for a bite with a friend.  I had been meaning to visit this place for a while, but never had a chance (and the time to actually sit down and enjoy a meal) until recently. When I stepped into line - the longest in the food court, I might add - I was expecting quality that was out-of-this-world. Maybe the fault lies with me for wanting too much.  What I got was... decent, but not worth the experience. After waiting in line, a friendly server took my order, and I was a bit surprised that it costs an extra $4 just to get a drink. Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot.  The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay, but considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money. The fancy ingredients they listed out in the menu didn't really amount to much for me, taste-wise. I was more impressed by the frosty mug they gave to me for my soft drink, and that was the high point of the experience.  Probably wouldn't come back again.~burger ~3
Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~Im2G1xHM1T1_Z0ao85mT1Q~The beef burger is really satisfying and the toppings have always been fresh, but BSB is definitely more expensive than burger joints of similar quality. The main advantage here is the convenience of the location (in Square One).   Classic 6oz beef burger (not combo) is $6.79 - you choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, jalapeños, pickles, red onion, tomato, lettuce.   Switching to Halal costs $1.49 - I really, really appreciate the option but this is steep for Mississauga when there are options like Burger Factory and On The Bun.   BSB has some good signature toppings like sautéed mushrooms and carmelized onions for a surcharge. Hoping they bring back goat cheese and feta cheese!~beef burger burger beef burger ( pickles, onion, tomato, lettuce. burger mushrooms cheese cheese! ~3

You pretty much get to see your burger get grilled from a fresh meat patty and onto the grill while you are waiting..the focus here is using fresh products which was also reflected in the condiments that went onto the burger..our combo  also came with a nice helping of fries that were pretty tasty.  We really loved the smokey flavour of our cheese burgers along with the fresh bun - the combo is pretty filling with fries but both wife and i were able to finish our plates.  Overall, service was very good from cashier to picking up the food , and  price was good value for a premium burger - our 2 combos with two cokes came to around $ 24 and change.!

The burger was served with a somewhat cold bun (aren't they supposed to toast or warm the bun on the grill?). This really ruined the meal. Also, the meat wasn't as juicy as I remembered it.

Hf4lagcWdxeHHanOQS5amw~AevKpV3rafoK66zR_gkF1A~My girlfriend and I love burgers and often resort to a good burger joint for comfort food. To our surprise, the Big Smoke Burger turned out to be quite tasty!  We ordered the spicy burger which had sautéed onions, lettuce,  tomato and spicy mayo. Overall, the burger was moist and had a lot of flavor. We also turned this into a combo with a poutine and a drink and to our surprise, the poutine was also amazing. Great flavor with the gravy, thick cut fries and actual cheese curds!   Unfortunately, the only down fall with the Big Smoke Burger was the cost. After all said and done: a quaint sized burger, poutine and drink came up to a grand total of $15, hence the rating of 4 out of 5. Otherwise, if the price was a little more reasonable, it would be a perfect rating.~burgers burger burger burger lettuce, tomato burger fries cheese burger burger, ~4
0obwvwj5OSDJAjLvKJvHEw~9u53TPFIByF__eiueQ2CZg~Sometimes decent deals, lately horrible staff yelling at random customers they haven't interacted with yet.  I was looking for a dress shirt, and the worker at the location ended up going after me speaking in an angered voice asking if I was the one who was looking for "the jacket" while she had a jacket in her hand. Apparently she went after my finacée several times asking her the same question. When I saw the people she was going after, the male was A LOT heavier than myself so appearance-wise we didn't share common traits other than both of us being white. The girl had different coloured hair and also looked quite different from my fiancée. I was hoping I'd have someone to measure me for a dress shirt, but that person not only seemed to be otherwise preoccupied, even after that couple left.  All-in-all, I've been having some issues in terms of the customer-service in this chain in general, and this location wasn't much better. Especially seeing workers playing with their cell-phones as opposed to helping customers (which was also something I observed).  So I'd be rather unlikely to return to this location with all that in mind.~white. ~2

6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg~hYczVjw0oUxTcAPIyUgDfQ~In the words of today's teenager: 'I can't even.'   After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting.   Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option.  (Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)    Fine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers.   I should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance.   Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.  20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? "Do you want another meal made?" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: "Does it taste like freezer burn?" "Yes!"  FACE PALM.   When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: "I can give you 15% off." My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal." "Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those." $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again.   Wild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow.~chicken chicken chicken. burger. chicken fingers. nachos. salsa lettuce chicken fingers chicken sour cream... sour cream chicken... chicken. fries, french fries ~1

It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks.   I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce. My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple. Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out but we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places.   Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us but never offered us any water to start. Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2.99/unlimited).  You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty. The whole establishment just felt very run down and slow.  Overall, I didn't have a horrible experience here but I also don't see myself coming back either.~chicken fries, cheese, celery carrot cheese thai pineapple. chicken ginger ~3
6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg~dY4DSHJbsf9S1GOTrty-EA~I dont really eat chicken wings as a meal, its just not my thing so I got the lucha libre tacos and all I have to say is GROSS. They were bad,bad,bad. Under seasoned, small and the tortilla bread was horrible. I dont know what I expected but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. They were COLD. Our group was the only people in the place and we could never find our waitress she kept disappearing to somewhere into the back which is really unhelpful when we seem to the the only people in there for the entire time we were there.   The food honestly is hard to explain how bad it was. I've had better food come from the freezer section at No-frills. I will not be returning nor will i return to any wild wing. The food and the service were both lacking.~chicken tacos ~2
6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg~49Wh0nt844PiGzfN9iauKw~Food is not bad at all.  Especially Wings and its flies are good.  Wing is not small.  It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice.  The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.  Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.  Place are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.  I think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.  Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time.~cheese fries sport ~3
6LosnKz5z2TUkNrgzOwrUg~GKlG_8dAfLfeIAjkeDdq-Q~I came here on a Sunday night after failing to get a table at All Star Wings. It was empty when my group an I arrived, with only one table occupied.   We all ordered wings and I liked that it came with fries. While we were waiting for our order, I started noticing a washroom/sulfur smell and everyone noticed it too. The smell was still there even as we were leaving. One other thing that bothered me was the washrooms were single washrooms but there was no lock on the door.  The food was very lacklustre and the wings reminded me of frozen breaded wings you'd get at a grocery store.   Overall, I would give the food one star and another star for the service. This place was dead for a reason and I definitely would not recommend this place at all.~fries. ~2
7VBdG44Qd3_8SV_4NYCxKA~HiLbJkiy86ebdtDlG7mazQ~I decided that with the weather getting hot, I needed to chop my hair off and remembered seeing this shop on my drives home. The shop owner was kind enough to keep her shop open late to accommodate my work schedule, because I wanted to come in on the same-day.   When I got there I told her I wanted a simple A-line cut bob, and as she proceeded to cut my hair off, I asked her "how red can you make my hair?" (I have very dark brown hair and a lot of times it is difficult to make it as red as I would like) and she asked me to choose which shade I would like (a vibrant red-violet) and told me she would try.  About two hours after her normal closing hours, I was done. I really liked that she gave me exactly what I asked for and was impressed she hadn't told me to return for the dye job like I expected.~brown ~4
7VBdG44Qd3_8SV_4NYCxKA~TlHQOMjrteUJ4Go7DQkT0A~Not everybody can cut cut Asian hair, so when I find someone that can, I stick with it.  I'm usually in n out like the burger...quick, affordable, and good.  And it's close to my hood too.  Plus after the cut, I get to have some burrrrs at Lucky's next door!!!!  C~burger... ~5
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~Naq_PR78bpFuNrOxFCQ2wA~went there with a friend last week had a hot chocolate , it was ok not the greatest one ive ever had! there was not much variety on the cakes and sweets side ! but all in all it is good to have a hot soup or drink after walking in the cold windy streets of edinburgh~soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~MRtfVWJabXp0RfTf2YwBfw~I heart Chocolate Soup! Chocolate Soup is the perfect way to recharge on a cold Edinburgh day. The small cafe serves a variety of hot chocolate, coffee, sandwiches, and soups. The soups are great because you can self-serve and put it in a cup with a lid to drink on-the-go if you're in a hurry--Perfect for those who need to get back to work or tourists who only have so much time to go sightseeing. Or, if you prefer, you can sit down and enjoy a large mug of luxurious hot chocolate. I sure did. Yum.~soup! soup coffee, sandwiches, ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~KzRi_ymzQuYxLGkg6AtWnA~So I had heard alot about this place. The hot chocolate was supposedly to be held as the god-of-all-hot-chocolates and it was in a "fantastic" location. Not quite my experience. I went here a couple of weeks ago with my friend who raved of the place but I'm afraid it didn't live up to expectations. It wasn't terrible; it was OK. But just OK. We ordered two hot chocolates, one mint choc chip and one white hot chocolate and to be honest we could have had one between us. The servings are truly generous although the bowl like cups were both a bit chipped and shabby.  Chipped and shabby was my general impression of the place actually. Sure the hot chocolates were satisfying in a gluttonous, sickly way that you expect of a place named "Chocolate Soup" but apart from that the experience wasn't great. First of all it was pretty pricey. £3.75 for a hot chocolate is expe nsive no matter how high someone tries to claim the cocoa content is.The staff were nice enough but the place seriously needed a clean and I won't even try to describe the bathroom. Location... meh looks onto the back of a church and there were alot of skaters annoyingly pressed right up against the window where I happened to be sitting. Not exactly going to be a favourite for tourists. My friend also had mushroom soup and it was "OK." Seems to be the work to describe this place: OK.~white soup" mushroom soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~aZ78gthGV_bnYTteiOla2Q~Whether you consider yourself to be a chocoholic or not, Chocolatesoup is a bowl of heaven. The best way to appreciate it is to try it. If it's your first taste an espresso sized shot may interest you. After that you are on your way to something bigger. The novelty does not grow old as there is always room for more. It is the chocolate soup that is the highlight of each visit but for those who want something different will appreciate other items on the menu. The chocolate on your lips will give you away, but that is not a problem.~soup ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~lOdVQ43wXe-LvyAuJtjDsA~Amazing muffins and chocolate treats but the coffee is sadly disappointing. Nevertheless, it is well worth going there if you have a sweet tooth and even better if you can snatch a window seat and watch the world go by.~coffee ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~pMPYRWcXR4YVMAug6muW1Q~Usually associating hot chocolate with the sachets of dried instant 'hot chocolate' you find in your dusty kitchen cupboard I was intrigued by the prospect of a real hot chocolate. Indeed they know how to make a decent hot chocolate, the high percentage cocoa and gooey decadent texture is scrumptious, but my experience was slightly marred in my attempts to get a tray bake which apparently was sold out...  This was clearly not the case as I was staring at numerous slabs of my choice through the glass counter and was subsequently snubbed by the staff. Usually minor staff/customer discrepancies like this go unnoticed.  However, I've read and heard many scathing reviews about the staff in this place and have recently left Chocolate Soup with an experience more akin to the sickly feeling you get when you've had too much rich chocolate.~instant ' soup ~2
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~b8Romch487jKuN6_9ypnoA~Unusually, or so it seems, I'm a female that isn't massively enamoured with chocolate. I do like the odd bit of dark chocolate, but I'm not keen on that sickly, treacly, sugar rush you get from too much milk or white chocolate, so normally I give large vats of chocolate substances a miss.  However, seeing this is a review written for anyone on the internet, I would say chocolate drinking is probably fairly high on a lot of people's lists, so if that's the case, coming to this emporium of chocolate options would be a pretty sensible call. Milk and white chocolate concoctions, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, bits of chocolate bars to put on top of your already calorific, sugar fest of a beverage, it's all here for your sweet toothed consumption.   You can also get coffee and tea in here, it's not completely chocolate based, plus there are some pretty awesome cup cakes too. Very busy due to its just off the Royal Mile location, so sometimes getting a table can be tricky.~milk white milk white coffee tea ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~wl3H0qZ0qlO-XNdc6lKKrA~Great alternative to the bigger brand coffee shops. Excellent range of drinks and really friendly staff.~coffee ~5
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~2nRqFTSGvUZ0gTVyYgCeAw~This café just off the Royal Mile serves some of the best hot chocolate, as its name suggests! They try to be creative with it as well, serving several varieties that come with nuts, marshmallows, cream and even white chocolate. It took some courage to admit I may not be the biggest fan of hot chocolate, which I find too sweet and extremely difficult to finish (you'll get your money's worth, as it comes in big mugs) but I adore this place for their desserts and toasted sandwiches. You can have a full or half sandwich, which come with goats cheese, salami, brie, mozzarella, avocado, meatballs, cheddar, just to mention a couple of fillings. And to follow, they have the most awesomest (error to emphasise deliciousness) muffins, such as their banana with toffee frosting one! Great place for a quick and light lunch break.~white desserts sandwiches. sandwich, cheese, salami, mozzarella, avocado, meatballs, banana ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~JvoQ-l-Ui30GcW1-O5Br4g~Chocolate soup?! Whatever will they think of next?!   I was intrigued with this place so accompanied a friend for lunch. It wasn't the nicest of places....sortof canteen-like and a little bit dirty. The white tables and white plastic chairs wern't very attractive....and the tables needed a good clean!!  I'm planning on giving Chocolate Soup a second chance, because all my friends rave about it . Watch this space~soup? white white soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~wlHX35C7R0i7L0IP-ZOILg~i got the WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE, and my friend got the MOCHA.  im not a fan of sweet sweet things and hot chocolate is def not my fave, but this place definitely impressed. it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and the slight taste of milk was delightful. hohohoho.  &&& the mocha! i do wish i got that. you get to choose if you want it mixed with white chocolate or toffee...   THIS IS A DEF A PLACE TO STOP BY AFTER YOU WALKED THE ROYAL MILE. :) the bathroom is kinda scary though.~white milk white ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~XvuuMVDuSXnRX4AIKnGMLw~Unless you're one of those weirdos who doesn't love chocolate, you'll absolutely love this place. In fact, if you've been in Edinburgh for more than a day then you'll probably have already been.  It's a simple but amazing concept - just like a regular coffee place/café, but the emphasis is almost entirely on chocolate. I've never seen so many different types of sundaes/chocolatey coffees/chocolate muffins/pain au chocolats under one roof, and despite my best efforts I've yet to sample them all.  If you're trying to convince yourself to be healthy, they also have freshly made porridge every day, as well as one of those granola-in-a-glass smoothies. But you can have all that at home.   Make sure you try their namesake drink. Or dish... their chocolate soup is so gloopy and amazing I'm not sure whether you eat it or drink it, but whichever it is it's definitely worth the calories. Just make sure you only order a shot of it, and not the large shot like I did... it's very filling and no, you won't be able to finish it without feeling sick for hours. A very happy sick, but sick nonetheless.  Why only 4 stars then? Out of sympathy for the poor staff. The last two times I've been here I've heard the manager-ess/owner absolutely laying into the other members of staff for something or another. Everyone else in the queue behind me looked just as awkward as I felt!~coffee smoothies. soup ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~R_5NdAqdhf2AYIl81OUEUg~This place has basically ruined hot chocolate for me- hot water + hot cocoa powder just tastes bland and watery now. Chocolate Soup is just off the Royal Mile so it's a convenient place to stop by on the way back onto campus on a cold day. Their hot chocolates are very sweet and creamy... though the zebra hot chocolate was a little bit too sweet/creamy for my tastes. My favorite was the simple chocolate soup with marshmallows. (:   My only real complaint is that sometimes the workers look ... very unenthused, like they really didn't want to be there. It makes ordering a little awkward/uncomfortable sometimes.~soup soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~Vd6hQC4ei0qEqWYkOVOL6A~A cute little cafe with decent food. I got a mozerella and salami sandwich/potato leek soup combination, both of which were good, but not amazing. The ordering system is kind of chaotic when it's busy -- I waited in line for about 10 minutes before I realised people were just shoving their way to the front. They have a lot of chocolate options (most of which are slightly overpriced), but I didn't try any of them, so maybe I missed out. The cafe itself is cute, though, and a great place to escape the cold and wind for a few hours.~salami soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~3IkTrFMVKB2Oefi3bKeyVw~This place sounds better than it actually is and once you've been once you will probably leave feeling sick enough to not go back again. One of my friends loves it here and I'm quite agreeable so will usually go along with her even if I only get a tea now as the thought of having another "chocolate shot" makes me feel queasy.   This place is always choc-a-block and it's usually quite hard to find a seat, it always just seems like such a stressful place no wonder they seem to be hiring staff quite a lot. I guess it's so busy due to it's location and also the novelty of it. I remember when I had my first white hot chocolate here, it was amazing but I felt ill half way through drinking it.  They also do pretty good sandwiches and paninis if you're feeling a little bit peckish but it's quite pricey and if you're just looking for light bite for a quiet catch up with friends then I'd go somewhere else.~tea white sandwiches ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~pds-DPTh6CiBeBB9_gc2DQ~Amazing hot chocolates, so many many different ones to choose from. There are also lots of cold chocolate drinks (like milkshakes). Coffee too, for those with less of a sweet tooth. And really tasty soup, always plenty of choice.~coffee soup, ~5
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~VGHSTQg7-NANCrxl_9ysNA~A lot of people I know really go mad for this place - but while I am not as big a chocolate fan as they may be, I really dont see the appeal of this place.  Chocolate Soup is basically a cafe that serves all of its dishes with a chocolate infused something or other, or a chocolate coated do-dah. Oh, and you can have a side order of a chocolate muffin and a chocolate latte to drink. You see my point.  The idea must be a good one however, as this place is always full - and I can see why, the food is actually very very nice, including the actual chocolate soup you can buy. The trouble is that it really is all a bit too much, and I could help but feel a little sick after I left here. The food is just too chocolate-y for my taste.  The staff werent bad, and to give them thier due, it was a packed weekend lunchtime, so I really couldnt fault them.~soup soup ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~_OO8ugKzk2e2cvr9Nill0A~Noticeable effort put into the hot drinks and food, whilst not much difference in price it does show in contrast to the bigger chain coffee shops.    I've missed the St Andrews Square branch since it closed :(~coffee ~3
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~P_h_K34Fl65dOS-8vs2EPQ~Small and pretty chocolate cafe. A kid's paradise especially for the choice of hot chocolates (black and white ones) with melting marshmellows on top. The portions are also impressive - you can have a cup of hot chocolate for lunch and won't feel your tummy rumbling afterward. I love the place mostly for the chocolate shots, something you won't get anywhere in town - it is served in Italian coffee cups, very dense, very sweet and very real. Apart from the chocolate drinks, there is a range of sandwiches and soups but I find them a bit pricey.~white coffee sandwiches ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~_rxf21-OA9TSuVPZ4kCycA~I didn't have as bad a time in Chocolate Soup as other reviewers seemingly have. I visited when it was a quiet period during a weekday which may explain why it was laid back. Certainly I would reconsider eating (or drinking chocolate?) in a place where the staff weren't treated well. Customer service is a tough gig when you're ill treated. Although I didn't see any of that stuff go on when I was there, I would've felt awkward and sorry for the staff if I had.  The concept of Chocolate Soup is awesome - it's soup, and it's chocolate. Who knew? You can't go wrong with that.   I agree with Lynsey, it's pretty sweet when consumed in vast quantities, but if you opt for something like a hot chocolate and a cake (or take it easy if you go for the chocolate soup) then you will enjoy it. You might get a sugar rush and come out in a sweat, but the likelihood is it'll be worth it.  A popular one with the tourists since it's quirky and original, but also popular with locals of all ages. Very busy at the weekend and it would get a bit full on if you were having chocolate soup on a daily basis, but great when saved for special occasions and meet ups. It's the kind of place you could take your mum, as I'm sure she will be bowled over by the idea of chocolate soup. Next thing you know, we'll be getting chocolate rain (I wish!)~soup soup soup, cake ( soup) soup soup. ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~-ceMzXeqndCaiiKw3f4g9Q~Chocolate. Chocolate. And more chocolate.  What else do you need to know? The chocolate soup of the name is thick, luscious stuff that young children could drown in and Willy Wonka would forbid you to touch with human hands. Yes, that good. If you're there for breakfast, try a dash of it on your porridge.~soup ~5
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~NexUAAIupOg4IAPq0jUCxA~On paper, Chocolate Soup sounds like a Must Visit.   A cosy cafe off the Royal Mile, it has a cluster of tables inside and out and a handful of booths which are perfect for small groups of friends. As the name suggests, it specialises in all things chocolate related from hot chocolate and chocolate soup to chocolate cake, chocolate brownies, chocolate croissants and chocolate ice-cream sunades. The latter comes complete with whipped cream in a tall glass and a selection of toppings.  The problem is, the chocolate they use as the base for all the dishes is dissappointingly bland. We're talking creamy miilk and white chocolate rather than dark chocolate with a high cocoa content and real depth and flavour. I tried a hot chocolate and chocolate soup and was so dismayed, I gave up after a couple of sips of both. The chocolate brownies were equally dire and doughy - making me long for something genuinely delicious like a Green and Blacks or Valrhona bar.~soup soup chocolate cake ~2
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~6SbF2gdIHPsChqYIfd-IVw~Chocolate Soup, how cute you are!!   Yummy yummy shortcakes and delicious hot chocolate!! And what a cute name. It's like a coffee shop converted into a hot chocolate shop with goodies of sweets where young tourists can relax.~soup, coffee ~4
2kWqGvYO1obP_bVLzOvhFw~FmLrzDVTF8SPUiPS6sA3Gg~Unlike the majority of the rabble, I don't even like the sound of Chocolate Soup, and being surrounded by middle aged women droning on about their husband's impotence, as well as promiscuous teenagers discussing what Cheryl Cole was wearing last night, just doesn't do it for me. I love chocolate. I love soup. Yet the two don't combine very well. As for the Chocolate shots, the less said about them the better.   The supervisor with the Auschwitz-style work ethic seems to be becoming a bit of a minor celebrity on Yelp, and to be honest the only reason I'll be going back is to get a look at him or her in action for myself. Nothing beats social awkwardness in a very crowded place.~soup, soup. ~3
-lbN0pSYgK2BRnHNV48PMw~751DoGeoBcDMXbFCxQvOoA~This is perhaps the closest pho restaurant to Port Credit. The place is nicely decorated and it's easy to get parking. The staff are friendly and the food comes out quickly. We tried pho, pad thai and a green curry - all delicious. This place is a really good find, the prices are reasonable and everything is fresh. I hope this place sticks around!~thai ~5

We ordered Pho and since they recently opened, the owner gave us an appetizer of mango salad, plus We also got a 15% off our bill. The service was great! Food came quickly and was tasty. We'll go back.~mango salad, ~4
-lbN0pSYgK2BRnHNV48PMw~jfvmng6gZpxetFAz1qy8QA~The food was very fresh and quite tasty. The mango salad was very nice, but lacked heat. It could have used a Thai bird chili.  The Tom yum coconut chicken soup tasted okay but was a bit too sweet. It could have used more coconut milk as it was a little watery. It also had a lot of celery, which isn't traditional and didn't add anything to the flavour.  The vermicelli with beef and lemongrass was very nice although it also didn't need the celery.  The restaurant and washrooms were clean, bright and very pleasant.  The service was excellent and very friendly.~mango salad thai coconut chicken soup coconut milk celery, vermicelli beef lemongrass celery. ~3
81L3dlwETvmOU3uz8cuVtg~nKzyotEUbGf0LqjrsNqXXw~I drive a 2010 Range Rover Sport,My check engine Light came on & I took my truck to my local mechanic, he advised me after scanning the car that I had a problem with 4 ignition coils and to take it to a Land Rover Dealer as they have a Land Rover scanner and can give me better diagnosis. I searched online for Land Rover mechanic & found BIRKSHIRE Automobiles advertising as a Land Rover Dealer Alternative, I phoned them and I explained to them the situation, they told me that they had a Land Rover scanner and it will tell them the exact problem after they scan my car (more detailed report than the Regular mechanic generic scanner). I made the appointment and went there, They scanned the car and the same results that I already knew were on their diagnosis report, the only difference was in the bottom of the report it said: customer to Call US. they charged me 1 hour labour and they refused to refund me, they informed me that will contact their Tech team in England and try and figure out  what the problem is and will get back to me within 3 days!!!.  I then called Metro West AUTHORIZED Dealer and gave them the codes and they told me over the phone what needs to be fixed.  I did give Birkshire a 1 star because the washroom was very clean and Sam spent a few minutes in my car showing me some controls, however; he didn't know all the controls and what they are made for.  I advise any Land Rover owner to take their truck to the Dealer at least for diagnosis at least for sure they know all the controls not half or so.  Hope you found my review helpful.~sport, ~1

Ordered BLT ... and the meat tasted old.  All food selections are pretty unhealthy.  No salad to substitute for chips... as with McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's, or Chick Filet.   Pretty sub-par sandwich.  Nothing to get excited about ... and as long as I don't get sick .. I guess I'm ok ... just not going back.  For the money ... Chipotle is probably a better, fresher, and healthier choice (depending upon what you choose) .. in the San Tan mall ...or even Paradise Bakery.~ice cream salad chips... sandwich. ~1
1PcKVFAi-6O_aG0MP6HsEg~w-taqJXhHC_8mlzm32LTVQ~Stopped in with my wife... really enjoyed the experience of finding my sleep number. Overall, I thought the sales person was helpful and understanding.  We left without purchasing.  He (Mike) did contact me to see if he could aid me further in my decision. I told him that we decided to go forward with the bed. We chose the i-8. By the time we purchased pillows covers, etc... I was in for about $8500.00. I know that is allot for a bed, but the positives outweighed the negatives.  On delivery day....not before but on the morning they were supposed to deliver, I recieved a bomb from Sleep Number... I was told that they forgot to put my bed on the truck for delivery and it was going to be another week!!! I was extremley disappointed...I told the lady that I wanted to cancel my order.... her response was... OK... let me  give you the cancelation department... Yep...they have a department to handle cancellations!!! What did that tell me???? So I spoke with the cancellation expert who I think was eating an apple or carrot while she was dealing with me... I was waiting for a Whats up doc to come out of her mouth... she was rude, and in a hurry to get off the phone. She told me that the box I received (Sheets and Pillows)needed to be delivered to UPS as refused... Just some homework for me to do. I asked for a confirmation number... she acted like I was crazy... we dont do that here... I called Mike, thinking that he could fix this.... he was not in, so I left a message. He never called???? He just lost an $8500 sale and never called???? I went by the store to purchase the pillow that I fell in love with... figured they could not screw that up... Spoke with Mike and the other sales people... while they were very apologetic and seemed to get my point, they were really no help. I asked them for a regiional managers number, so that we could discuss the problem. What I did not mention was that my wife and I broke down our old mattress and were ready for delivery...for nothing.  The staff said that they could not give the regional managers number to me, but they would tell him the situation and he may call me... that was about a week ago...no call.  Look if you like poor customer service and really dont care what happens when you have issues with your purchase... by all means buy Sleep Number!!! Im shopping for something different.~apple carrot ~1
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~4SXpYH3Jjhev83VPt9Aw2A~Bivy is truly a gem in the Toronto brunch scene. I used to live a block away from Bivy and it literally was one of my top highlights of living in that neighbourhood. It is so good!  First and foremost - I really dislike brunch. Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts. But Bivy was a game-changer for me when I discovered it 2 years ago - and still insist on travelling on the weekends to go back there today! Do yourself a favour and go.  - Intimate but not crowded - Rarely a wait - Generous portion sizes - I almost always order the Ploughman Platter, but have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed - I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate - Great prices  You won't regret it.   Update:  I'm not sure what happened on a recent Saturday brunch visit (March 2016). I had talked up this place to a couple of girlfriends, and convinced them to trek a little farther outside of our usual stomping grounds to meet at Bivy. Holy moly. Everything I've known about this place was flipped upside down.  - Unbearably cold in the space. Teeth chattering. - My beloved Ploughman Platter that has been consistent for years came out so different than usual. No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here!? - My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so salty  Service was also slow and unattentive this afternoon. I really hope this was an off day for them. I usually see the gentleman who I believe owns the restaurant working in the kitchen, and he wasn't there this day. Coincidence?~salads salad) pickles - ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~rtNqfrmYubqEUw0QnHhhOw~This is the most unassuming, underrated, unsung hero in the Dundas West strip. I never meet anyone who's heard of it or has been to it but I bring people anytime I need a good brunch or lunch. The chicken salad is packed with great stuff and so reasonably priced, the omelettes are always perfect, and the one time I came for dinner I had the jerk mussels which were excellent! It's so inexpensive and so delicious, the only thing I'm nervous about is that everyone is going to catch on and I'll have to wait to get a seat.~chicken salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~msM0s74jJIkGzHocE7EcTA~The brunch is one of the best, and most affordable in the city. You rarely have to wait for a table and the service is good. That makes Bivy a real gem in the often over-priced, over-hyped Toronto restaurant scene.   Everything on the brunch menu is great but I would highlight the Croque, The Farcou (original version), the Tartiflette and the french toast. Their potato salad and green salads are always fresh and delicious. I'm told the coffee is excellent ( I'm a tea drinker - their selection is good).  I have sampled the dinner menu much less but the pulled pork sandwich is good - excellent flavour - and the frites are great.   Excellent value, excellent food and a lovely atmosphere.~french toast. potato salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~9geYesiOkKfykAVZsVgs7w~BIVY is one of my absolute favourite restaurants. The space is cheery and bright during the daytime and smooth and romantic in the evening for their new dinner menu. I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work... I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food.  They hit it out of the park with their farçous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to. I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax... Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting. Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and then their phenomenal potato salad...  Possibly the best I've ever had. It's definitely a step up from something you'd have at a BBQ. Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right.  Since they just launched their dinner menu, I've only tried it once, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto, but BIVY has it down. Their entrecôte steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed butter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad. For $18.95! Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night. We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good.  I know I'm just gushing at this point. I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot. It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option. A lot of restaurants wouldn't be able to juggle all those identities, but BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service. I'm so happy to live near by. The only problem is that I'm constantly tempted to say "Let's just go to BIVY" instead of, you know, cooking at home and not blowing my paycheque on daily jaunts to my favourite neighbourhood spot.~coffee spinach pancakes) salad greens, potato salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~a4pWzgtEBDcVRqrrsW2tOQ~Bivy is a contemporary Canadian brunch spot with a French influence. Upon entering during the day, the restaurant gives a relaxing vibe for customers to sit down and enjoy their meal or coffee. Bivy has brunch and dinner hours, which you could come in for dinner from Tuesday through Saturday. They close from 4-5 PM during those days to prepare for the evening. Bivy serves interesting dishes, such as their French spinach pancakes and their different version of the French toast (which is more of a bread pudding).  The beer served are sourced locally from Ontario. The alcoholic drinks consists of beer on tap and basic cocktails. To give back to their customers, Bivy has a policy of giving one free cup of coffee to a customer everyday. This is an awesome policy and a great way to brighten up someone's day!  I tried their Mochaccino, which is their version of a mocha and I believe cappuccino combined. It has a nutty taste to it so it is great if you like that flavour. Overall, I think Bivy is a nice spot to go to for a quick brunch with friends or your significant other during the week.~coffee. spinach pancakes french toast ( coffee ~3
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~Eno64TCRD2BZr2aVmrhx8A~Good portion sizes and yummy food. This is a reliable lunch/brunch spot that is a very relaxing place to hang around during the weekdays. I almost always get the spinach pancakes with house smoked salmon (weekends) or bacon (weekdays). As well, delicious cookies, and shortbreads are only 3 for $1.50.~spinach pancakes smoked salmon ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~R1EYuKdcGyRySlEIorbIzg~One of my new favourite joints in the west end. Came for a lunch meeting without any reservations.   Ordered the Countryside Farçous: French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12.95 (9/10). These pancakes were Gluten free baby. Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe. The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty, but was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad.   My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10.75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings. Something I will definitely try on the next visit.   Rating Summary:  Food: 9/10 - Overall excellent food, meat was a tad too salty.  Atmosphere: 10/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting. Modern décor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing.    Service: 8/10 - Water service needs improvement. Friendly staff. Quick service for a lunch hour.   Can't wait to come back.   Note: Bivy only takes cash or debit cards.~spinach pancakes greens & potato salad ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~-dEmai6vdrqAgZ1vWg33Lg~Great find! Wandered in for lunch as there aren't many options in the neighborhood. Had a wonderful open faced tuna sandwich served with lots of fresh salad. My bf had the Farcous which was also excellent. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Planning to go back to try their home-cured salmon!~tuna sandwich salad. salmon! ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~eiYCy1AFzMUjHNQU4y85VA~This is a great place. The food is really good but what impressed me the most were the prices.  It is cheaper than Swiss Chalet (aka Swiss Pigeon) and like 10x better quality.  I had duck confit and my father had the Ribs, both were great and cheap.~swiss swiss ribs, ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~IMRH9tpSi0kimf4R7g3LJA~Discovered this place from my "Indie Coffee Passport". Went for a morning coffee, but decided to stay for breakfast.  Ordered the "Baked French toast", WOW it was very good.  Nice small place, quite, good food and friendly services.  I would go back!~coffee coffee, french toast" ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~8GVepsyCF3DQzX-KksKCtQ~My wife and I recently moved into the area and Bivy happens to be just down the street. As we saw they were now serving dinner we wanted to give it a try. Overall we were shocked by how good the food and service were from the salad to the mussels and the duck confit. Best of all is the price which you would expect to pay double for. We go out to eat about once a week all over the west end and this was one of the best dinner experiences we have had in a while.~salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~seWV-PCavMpoNu1CcPUjfA~My partner and I took our moms here, as we had heard good things. We were not disappointed. Everything from the mains to the sides to the coffee were exceptional. The fresh goat cheese, the spinach pancakes, the salads, the quiche. Perfect portions and delicious!~coffee cheese, spinach pancakes, salads, ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~YWI0bjTviTXfPV0IAW4vkA~Came here today during the Dundas West Fest,  I haven't explored this side of the city yet and had no clue where to eat, my stomach was growling and this cafe appeared at just the right time.   We were greeted by a very smiley young man who gave us a quick run down on the menu (the sandwiches were on special if we ate outside due to the festival).  I ordered the Eastern (sun dried tomato hummus + roasted red peppers + goat cheese + baby spinach) and the man in my life ordered the Tuna Twist  (flaked tuna + mayo + avocado + hard-boiled egg).   Wow both sandwiches were divine, extremely fresh and tasty. After a couple of bites the lower half of my face was covered in red hummus, its the kind of mess you just want more of, luckily for me the man in my life has seen it all before.   Until the next time Bivy, thank you...~sandwiches tomato cheese spinach) tuna tuna avocado egg) sandwiches ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~ZvUXbcYN0YqBZGvdR4npQw~Lovely flavors and friendly staff. Had the vegetarian spinach pancakes as well as a veggie sandwich - both with the amazing potato salad on the side.~spinach pancakes sandwich - potato salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~bc2Tg3wU6JtO-DVN26cEIg~Second time there for Brunch, delicious. My friend had the brisket and I had the croque monsieur, she loved hers and wanted mine too. The croque was delicious and we both agreed it was one up on Bonjour Brioche - which has held this accolade for some time! I do suggest you try it. The other thing I have here is the Farmers Salad which just makes me feel happy and well fed.~salad ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~JUdCeJM4q7gn1602JMqjCw~Fresh food from whole ingredients, consistently prepared well.  Great coffee.  Reasonable prices.    Friendly, unpretentious service.  Been here many times, and it's always been good.  What else do you want?~coffee. ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~w3hBV5iC88Sj3pZocSbBfw~Music by Monkees!! Away from hustle and bustle. Great food and good coffee awesome service what else can you ask for.~coffee ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~_Lf36Zro9uzPOJ2ACJPGiQ~3.5 Stars.  Sometimes we like to do really good things, but at some point it ends up being too much; maybe we bite of more than we can chew.  The Bivy is a good spot in Little Portugal, but there is A LOT going on in this place. They serve decent coffee--not the best, not the worst--, they serve brunch and dinner, and they have a liquor license, which gives them the opportunity to sell alcohol too. This leads to an unfocused attention on certain items they may want to do better, the coffee being one of them.  I like the layout of the place. The tables and chairs seem to work well with the place and actually brighten the place up. The staff are very friendly and willing to serve everyone well.  The place is a great place, but I get the feeling they are a little confused as to what they want to be known for. Is it a great coffee place? Is it a great brunch spot? Is it a great place to get a night cap? There isn't an identity here.  Nonetheless, 3.5 stars for me because it exceeded a little bit of expectations, but could be more if they truly found their identity.  That's it.~coffee-- coffee coffee ~3
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~sH7-rlwYSr5D2P6MzzLL6g~I've come here twice now. First for coffee/tea and a cookie. Second for brunch.  The tea is higher quality than what you'd find at most cafes in the city - very fragrant and flavourful. The baked goods are excellent.  Had the croque monsieur, farcou, and ploughman's breakfast. Weren't too interested in some of the offerings in the ploughman's breakfast but the farcou and croque monsieur were impeccable and well-priced. Perhaps the ploughman's is for more adventurous eaters.  This was the first time I'd gone for brunch in ages where I didn't have to wait in a line for a table. What a refreshing change! Also, staff was SUPER friendly!~tea ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~ydN3KgVk7yZHjnuueiNLig~Initially the purpose of this trip was to get cappuccino from the Indie Coffee Passport (ICP) but once we saw the brunch menu we decided to to eat here as well. My friend decided to order a french toast and I went for Poire Helene since I am a sucker for pear desserts. For the ICP we both ordered a cappuccino.  The service is decent here and we were checked on regularly and the server even shared her fav on the ICP. The food did take its time to arrive though even though the we went at off peak hours.  The French Toast is a mini portion, it is quite good nonetheless. Raisin haters beware as they do use raisin bread. Poire Helene was just OK as I have had a lot better versions.  On to the cappuccino  Espresso: Mild Crema': below average Milk: Frothed OK This is a very average attempt at a Cappuccino. I would say 2 stars and that's pushing it already. The decent food gives it a bump to 3. They did push their dinner and gave us a discount coupon for that. Cash and Debit Only!!~coffee french toast pear desserts. french toast raisin raisin milk: ~3
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~l7jHYRUnuDZU1TtE7UIBtA~My first visit to Bivy was during the DuWest sidewalk sale. I went in when they were slammed and waited quite a while for a take out order. The wait was worth it. I had a house cured salmon sandwich and it was great. My wife and I just went for brunch today and I had the French pancakes with again their house cured salmon, a nice mixed green salad and potato salad, which I believe comes with every dish. My only suggestion would be some form of creme fresh or sour cream to compliment.  Friendly service, and a nice atmosphere, complements your experience. I'll definitely return.~salmon sandwich pancakes salmon, salad potato salad ~4
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~Vr9Vmlhp4ug7aWL7MlprjA~Loved this place. A bit of a diamond in the rough of that area. Started with the Charcuterie to share amongst the three of us. Wonderful while chatting and sipping a wine. I thoroughly enjoyed my Salmon entrée but was able to share the steak that my wife had and would order that next time. The duck was also delicious and I enjoyed that as well. Service (by Patrick) was discreet and relaxed to fit the ambiance. Worth a trip to that part of town for food from a genuine French chef and owner Pascal.~salmon steak ~5
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~REzaBdKAXW1rMv6_4cxlCA~Stopped into Bivy for a weekend dinner, and was adequately happy with the results. The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables.   We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity.  As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring.   In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip. So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results. I'll come back, but admittedly there are a few other joints in the neighbourhood which have priority in my dining agenda.~ribs, pulled pork ~3
10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA~7NFqxgkySULqE2VYuqq57w~This hidden gem was the perfect place to have lunch and a catch up session with an old friend.   We came on a weekday, and it was pretty full already. The menu is a pseudo all day breakfast fare with some lunch options too.   I like that they have something different. Farcous is a spinach pancake, flat and crispy. They have a traditional which is mixed also with red onion and cheddar, among others like with smoked meat. It comes with a big salad.  My friend got the ploughmans platter, a mix of smoked salmon, hard boiled egg, pate with a salad and other things. It was okay, and perfect to share both dishes.   I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, definitely check it out.~spinach onion salad. smoked salmon ~4
1ovFbjcn13ovvMC94F2e7g~VC16aXHyb1tCFw5dQoQ0VA~Can I Get Banned From Yelp For Saying FOURSQUARE?  SITREP  This is definitely one reason for keeping your Foursquare app running on your iPhone.  I got a 2-4-1 Rum & Coke drink special $6, so I'm not complaining.  THE SETUP  Inside the Luxor Hotel, Liquidity is a nice chill bar that isn't as pretentious as some of the other bars on the casino floor or on the 2nd Level.  It's also - as far as bars go - a bit off the beaten path in this hotel and so only experiences half the congestion of the other bars.  DRINKS  Besides the special I mention at the top of the review, most of drinks are between $5 and $8, and include shots with them if you ask for the right ones.  I'm not really a gambler like the friends, and so chill spots like this are really nice to take a break at, especially when engaged in a deep conversation with someone.  THE LOWDOWN  When hanging out at the south end of the Vegas Strip, this is definitely a nice bar to retreat too away from the noise.~coke ~4
1ovFbjcn13ovvMC94F2e7g~UHJ21L98sQLapFATfsaMvg~Liquidity is a bar lounge in the middle of the Luxor, the perfect place to have a drink or two prior to getting your night started.  The lounge has a nice cascading waterfall on the side and a small but good drink menu.  I must admit my favorite drink on the menu is called the Love Potion; which taste like a cherry jolly rancher candy, it is delicious. This is a great place to unwind after work or pre-drink before the nightclub.~cherry ~4
1JiGtnWQYFcsactL_c3wCw~z63uG_y0HfXCrgxpM4G_eg~Do not use! We contracted this company to clean and seal our grout, clean our tiled shower and to fix two tiny places where the grout had "dropped". The technician arrived on time and began in the shower. About a half hour into the shower cleaning, he called for me to point out some places where the tile had been damaged....even apologizing for it. I texted the owner who told me that the technician had already called her and told her that he had pointed out the damage to me before he began. I corrected her and even told her that when I felt the tile where the damage had occurred, it was wet! He finally want on the last hallway, when he called to me agin to tell me that his machine had just stopped working. The hallway was covered in a slimy, wet cleaning solution. He then proceeded to mop it up and put some blowers on it to dry it. call number two to the owner and we agreed they would come back on Monday to redo. (This was a Thursday). The technician went out to his truck to retrieve the caulking gun to fix the two spots but returned empty handed because he could not find the gun. Oh and the grout was not sealed as promised! Saturday, as my husband and I left the house, we noticed a large brown stain surrounding the spigot that the technician had attached his hose to. Another call to owner and I explained that I no longer wanted the technician to come back on Monday....they had done enough to damage to my house. She explained that her partner (her husband-Leo) would be out Monday to inspect the damage. Leo arrived and told me that he felt that the brown stain was from a leak behind the wall and not from his technician not connecting properly. However, he said he would call We'd or Thursday and come out to clean the stain after the rain had stopped and the wall had had time to dry. Well folks, it is Saturday, and you guessed it....no phone call....no Leo. Do not call this company unless you want your house damaged. I have called another company to come in and repair all of the damage they have left behind and will be contacting our attorney to forward them the bill.~brown brown ~1
1JiGtnWQYFcsactL_c3wCw~0bUSxqlNjAuGKQua9tCb9g~As a 19 year old college student, one could understand that I don't have a lot of extra money in my pocket to spare. I moved into my first apartment with high hopes of keeping it clean and receiving my security deposit back, however, between living with three roommates and having friends over - at the end of our one year lease we started to worry we were never going to get any sort of deposit back due to the tremendous amount of stains we had acquired in our carpet. Between owning three kittens, alcohol spillage, and mud tracked in from where we parked our vehicles, our capers looked like absolute hell.  I read the reviews for Service Clean on Yelp and saw that they seemed to be reasonably priced, efficient, professional, and understanding. It also looked like they were available, good at scheduling appointments and provided free estimates. We needed to get our carpets cleaned ASAP, considering we procrastinated doing it until we only had one week left in our lease, we were frantic to find a place that could fit us in & not break our budget.  Leo showed up on time and was excellent at explaining how the whole process worked from start to finish. Considering our young age, none of us knew what to expect or how anything worked, or if we would get dicked over on prices. Leo was very careful and kind. Myself and one of my roommates are both art majors and have a lot of delicate, large, awkward pieces scattered around the house. I was worried they would get bumped or ruined - but Leo was very mindful of all our belongings and nothing was damaged whatsoever. Leo and his partner were efficient, you can tell they work hard and fast, but take the time to make sure the job is done correctly. They wore protective footwear to not track any dirt or mud inside the house when they were going from the van to the house. They gave us each a pair as well which was awesome because once the job was done and we were waiting for our carpet to dry, we slid around in the booties on our fresh, clean carpet and celebrated with a dance off. Our carpets looked phenomenal, better than when we first moved into the place. Even our owner made a comment about that after seeing them! We received our security deposit back in full.  Great company. Great guys. Definitely would recommend & will be going back to in the future.~capers ~5
5paJ02eNpdJOX8TffqdzYg~EbiD2qfsZJQIB59_bAjZ3w~This is the first time I visit this restaurant.  They have more or less the same décor as the last owner.  The food surprisingly is good given the price of the dim sum.  The portion is large.  We order the beef ball and it comes with 4 balls, most of the restaurants only have 3.  One of the baked pie and sweet milk pudding that we ordered are not that good, the rest are above average.  You cannot beat the price with the quality in the location around.  They have lots of parking in the mall.~beef pie milk ~4
5paJ02eNpdJOX8TffqdzYg~7Eug5MXZ8XEm7-9IHB5Kiw~Looking for a new dim sum place, we ended up at Golden Crown Dynasty Cuisine.  Greeted with smiles, we were led into the dining area.   High ceilings, bright yellow walls, and actual cloth table coverings! Sure, there was a giant grease stain in the middle of the table, but I'll pretend I didn't see it.  The dim sum menu is extensive and they have some neat items. * I really liked the spicy shrimp dumplings with XO sauce! * The siu mai had huge shrimps and was fresh and piping hot. * Sticky rice was okay but nothing to rave about. * Beef noodle roll had celery in it... that's different... * We gave the crispy abalone pastry puffs a try, they didn't taste too much like abalone though.  * The escargot pie with Portuguese sauce was tasty but very sweet * For dessert, we ordered the two colour crystal balls... They looked exactly like the description.  Tasty dessert dumplings where you could see through to the filling (red bean and custard)  The food was freshly made and the portions weren't bad.  They give you 3 of everything which is different, there's usually four.  I went with one other person and we had to duke it out for the second piece of items we liked!  Overall, I had a nice dim sum experience and I will return if I'm in the hood.~shrimp shrimps beef celery pie ~3
BLEahNnfVfSj6g8efxyWAw~tk7JOhSOCTjtlRFNjzTPkQ~I've been visiting Marmalade on and off since I started my new job, and have been here a few times before too. Every time food has been quick, yummy and a good price.   Today I had the Ploughman's Salad, which I thought would arrive in a small plastic container and I'd have to eat with those horrendous plastic forks. But no, a big plate of ham, cheese, egg, two kinds of pickle, lettuce and tomatoes landed on my table and I was mighty impressed. All for a paltry sum of £2.60! I think I will be a regular here from now on.~salad, cheese, egg, lettuce ~4
BLEahNnfVfSj6g8efxyWAw~rh2PDsBrUHubxZ4zFB-RWg~I love Cafe Marmalade for various reasons.   First of all, it produces amazing flavourful soups which tempt you to come back day after day... Every day they have 3 varieties of soups and you get a large hunk of baguette to go with it as well. So for example a large cup of tomato & bean soup to takeaway is £1.70.  One day I was hesitating between two flavours and the lady kindly offered a wee sample for me to taste which I thought was a nice touch. In fact all the staff there are super friendly and always smiling, which is another reason to go there.   Cafe Marmalade also does nice salads, wraps, sandwiches and cakes. They also sell portions of home made foods, e.g. lasagne so I would say pretty much all your lunch time needs are satisfied here :)~tomato & soup salads, wraps, sandwiches lasagne ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~UKnMTQhW18TBEijsjdf7VQ~A friend suggested we meet here for dinner. I agreed, then looked it up and was horrified by the reviews, and fearful of food poisoning. I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.  It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.  We went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*  So it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a "blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).  One special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.  Last night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE.   *I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be "meh--I've had better" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a "meh" in practice. I'm going with that.~tea sushi sushi sushi salmon sushi sushi salmon salmon, ~3
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~eQwRC9q1M_VQhOu_l1PwUw~I was in the neighbourhood to see a documentary and this place was literally across the street. Convenience won the day.  It was only after I sat down that I checked Yelp. Based on the reviews I was totally expecting a shitstorm the entire time, but alas, no horrifically crappy service or explosive diarrhea to speak of.   Granted, I had a lunch combo and can't speak for the AYCE situation.   The service was good, the food was decent. They could've given me more rice though...I was trying to hit my macros jeez.   And wondering whether they still serve salad with their hands? Ignorance is bliss.~salad ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~xufjrZKrWVP5PJYJ5ypkMw~Bad quality for a cheap price. It's not just the quality of the ingredients, but also the cooking methods. When you taste the chicken and say is this actually cooked enough that is enough to say this place is horrible. I do not say this from just one experience I say this from a couple and Everytime I ask the same question.~chicken ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~JBtXrg5F8lY-qu44bBGl6w~After watching a great Hot Doc, my fiance and I were hungry and saw this place directly across the street.  We went with the more expensive AYCE menu.  Service wasn't so good.  Our waitress barely spoke english and was not very attentive.  Never noticed even a smile out of her.  We were seated near the front of the restaurant and felt a draft everytime the door was opened (also, there was a piercing squeak noise that happened everytime the door was pushed open all the way).   Now onto the food...sushi was so so with too much rice used.  Most of the had a pickled taste to it.....not sure what it was nor do I want to know now.  Sashimi was sub par.  Grilled meat tasted a little grisly and wasn't cooked enough.  I guess you pay for what you get and I should have walked further down the street t an a la carte sushi place.  I will not go back to this place...~sushi sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~A9Hlp-tmVejUvZnhsQORyA~After reading all the other reviews on here, I guess we got lucky tonight?  The servers seemed tired, but service was still good. We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.  We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the "lower" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.  The sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)  Sashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the "Excellent Role" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.  On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).  Overall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.  I want to say 3.5 stars, but that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars.~tea sushi sushi white salmon sushi shrimp banana. tempura banana, ice cream ( tea coconut sushi, sushi ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~XJWrWnySZkrgkt5UbUi1Vw~Definitely not the best sushi place to be found in the area. Not that it's particularly bad or anything but it just doesn't live up to the standards set by its competition. Food was average and they didn't have the torched sushis, service was surprisingly slow since they had about three servers working and not a lot of people to serve.  If you're ever in the area looking to have some sushi, do yourself a favor and walk down the street to another restaurant.~sushi sushi, ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~fpnJ4B37FW92JauTampptA~Too much rice filled with vinegar. Subpar if not rude service and stairs that you can die on walking to the washroom where you will want to vomit from the overpriced, terrible eating experience you just had. Got sick from eating here and regret giving these owners any money.   Don't believe the signs or the location, this place will be bankrupt soon and is a disgrace to sushi everywhere.  Head over to Big Sushi, Sushi on Bloor or really anywhere on the street you will have food that is 30x tastier with much nicer staff.~sushi sushi, sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~Ct7w7he4Ur-6jbsCGTTy7g~This place used to be really good before they renovated the location. However, the last time I went back to this place in September, the sushi rolls were basically the size of a coke can with an extremely big overload of rice. I would actually consider it a rice ball more than sushi. We had ayce but all we ended up getting were the rolls first and by the time we got through the rolls we had no more space for the sashimi. Bottom line, they tried to fill us up with rice so that we would eat less of the sashimi or other food on the menu (cheaper for them). This place for sure will run out of business if they keep this up. Even the lady serving us felt bad and understood when we wanted her to take away the remaining of the rice clumps.~sushi coke sushi. ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~y6IXYFRykjorvGuQX3ONvQ~I love this AYCE and even for takeout, I go out of my way to come to Mariko because the rolls are big and the sushi is fresh. But yes, this is an affordable AYCE sushi spot with good customer service--they're pretty sweet and smile and work hard. Like the menu too, and the convenient location.~sushi sushi ~5
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~FhJEIIfAsJa1qRrkY3K2bg~This was my husband's and mine first AYCE sushi place back in the day. It is a special place for us when we were just starting out. We went back for old time's sake for on a weekday night last week and the sushi and tempura were good. You get a choice to eat off the 16.99 AYCE or the 14.99 one. Not the top best but the price is good. The service is nice with a smile. Keep in mind this is in the university area and meant to be affordable. If you are looking for a good place and quick. There were many people coming in for pick up. I realized at the end of the meal that I forgot to take pictures so only managed to get the vegetarian rolls.  Which they have many vegetarian options. Also the fried banana tempura with chocolate is yummy!~sushi sushi tempura banana tempura ~3
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~UiqfLVTYKcW63AplqqpAhg~The first time I walked in to Mariko, I sat at a table waiting for almost 15 minutes for someone to take my order before choosing to just leave. It wasn't busy, almost empty really, and servers could be seen chatting amongst themselves.  I should have heeded that warning.  Before Mariko, I wouldn't have believed that sushi could be made and served so poorly. The rolls were mostly rice, falling apart from poor construction, actually lukewarm, and the fish (what there was of it) was definitely not fresh. The "spicy sauce" that covered some options seemed to be little more than a greasy spiced mayonnaise-like goop that I might expect to see at a roadside Denny's.   A server dressed in dirty sweatpants? Dust-covered exposed wiring tangled around the tawdry lighting fixtures?   Never again.~sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~ktxmt-8xrmk0WOyinqKsVA~This isn't somewhere one goes for the ambience and I'm sure the service varies depending on who's working on a particular evening, but I went here for the first time with a friend last night, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The sushi was also fresh, delicious, and well prepared (the $17 AYCE).~sushi ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~Wqn6z4O-whs_QPv8i8SP_Q~The worst sushi i've ever had in my life! it took more than half an hour to get our food (and they were not busy), when we did finally get it the food was inedible. the rice was soggy & so was the tempura. The staff was barely competent and even after interrogating me as to why i could not eat more than 5 pieces would not even take a dollar off the almost 30 that disgusting meal cost me.~sushi tempura. ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~V8W2x5ee5URUWgrBxH1snA~We're regulars here, often going on a weeknight after work.  We get great food -- though sometimes a bit uneven. Never had soggy tempura here (or agedashi dofu), though occasionally have had sashimi that was still a bit cold from freezing. Never had poorly rolled rolls, or otherwise sub-par food.  No language barrier for us, and we have an established relationship with the servers/chefs. Under these circumstances, the food is excellent.   It is not quite as clean as it used to be before the remodel, and service can be, but isn't always, a bit slow. But for the price, its been unbeatable for an all-you-can-eat sushi fix.~tempura sushi ~5
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~iFzZa0MvcmoTRa73XVtlLw~Good service and a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices in a super reasonably priced "all-you-can-eat" @Bloor & spadina. Consistent quality and bottomless tea. We keep coming back and I am sure they sustain a heavy loss with my s/o that puts away enough vegan sushi to feed a small village...~tea. sushi ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~VcFSYUtcNo5wCF9iNALSrg~I wish we had looked at the Yelp reviews earlier but with no phone on us we just walked in, baited by the $16.99 AYCE price.   My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.  Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.  But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.  Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..  Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7.   We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..  To those that still want to try Mariko's AYCE for their first time and to those that will unknowingly walk in like we did, stay safe.~tempura tempura, carrot. salmon ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~sWBI8QveWfHMm2m8i_ofZg~Complete shite AYCE.  Yes, it's cheap. But it's freaking awful.   I was taken here on a really bad date (first & last) once.  The rolls look like they were made by a blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw. They come out mostly rice with one tiny slice of rotten avocado or cucumber as an afterthought, doused in that sickingly sweet glaze sauce that makes everything taste better.  The decor is cheap and dated. I can't rememer if the service was horrible or not, so it was probably adequate.  There's cheap and then there's Mariko cheap. Don't say I didn't warn you.~date ( avocado cucumber ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~7KpqiLR96DbuF4u8F5mcMA~Had the AYCE once. Wasn't bad, but not awesome either. Can find better for the price, but maybe not around.  Today I tried the chicken Katsudon, and once again flavor was fit for the price (bowl wasn't small, so you get some value).~chicken ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~BbVdbU_lushd3MC0MgUlxw~So me and my girlfriend wanted to eat some sushi and we went here to give it a try and to me it's was pretty crappy.. Their sushi rolls are bad because the seaweed and the rice are old. Not worth the money at all. They're getting 2 stars because the staff are nice and if you order more than $8 you get a choice of 3 pieces of dumplings or sushi.~sushi sushi sushi. ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~zGhURniscJTg6Bv4Iotn0A~The red snapper shashimi was soggy and mashed up. The waiter could barely comprehend what I wanted to order. She looked half asleep. I was ordering takeout and I asked for a fork with my garden salad. She predictably forgot. It was difficult just paying for the order--as she seemed so distracted and wasn't on hand to take my cash.   My verdict: Mediocre food, poor service~garden salad ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~UpDxa0lYx26ai2uFr7uM2w~The best part about Marikos is the price. 16.99 for a large selection of sushi. My girlfriend and I used to come here almost every other week (some months once a week). Sadly when i went by on December 12th there was an eviction notice in the window. Heartbroken i made my way to one of the many other restaurants around. RIP Marikos Sushi~sushi. sushi ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~_wNFyBHufRcPpozpb1YNVw~This is literally the WORST restaurant experience my boyfriend and I have ever, EVER had. I cannot find the words to express how terrible this place is. If I could give less than one star, I would.   Somehow, even the miso soup is awful... the cups tasted like soap but still seemed unclean, and the bowls had little flecks of paint chipping off. The rice was bordering on crunchy, the "spicy salmon rolls" looked like dog food smothered in a pinkish hot mayo, wrapped loosely in what I guess was supposed to be a roll.   After realizing that the rolls were horrendous, we thought we would stick to kitchen items. This was no safer; I bit into the "sweet and sour chicken" to find it was almost entirely raw on the inside.  We tried to wash everything down with plentiful amounts of water from our soapy, dingy cups, but the server ignored us entirely and did not refill our cups. We were one of two couples in the place, and yet we were entirely ignored for most of our time there.   When my boyfriend went to pay, he saw the cook sleeping in a booth....~miso soup salmon chicken" ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~dmWyOV1pJIgtVbRf6ff_wA~I work at a restaurant as a food runner, and if there is one immutable law of bringing food to a table, it is that you serve all the people at the table as close to simultaneously as you can. I came here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, and, given that we are a mere table of two, the difference in time between our receiving of meals should be measured in split seconds. It wasnt. My meal came first, and when it became apparent that hers wasnt coming any time soon, I tried my utmost to exercise self-control in eating my meal. Given that I was sure the fish wasnt the freshest to begin with, I didnt much like the idea of sitting and watching it get older, but propriety demanded it of me. About 15 minutes later, we had both had enough. I was given the green light to begin eating. By the time I was finishing my meal, roughly 15 minutes after that, her meal finally came out. Her avocado Salad consisted of  a whopping amount of iceberg lettuce and a whole quarter of an avocado. We both left the restaurant in a pissy mood, and our hunger was only slightly put off. I spent the next 10 hours skirting around illness. As far as cheap sushi on bloor goes, you can get better for cheaper.~avocado salad iceberg lettuce avocado. sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~3K9ldzb8JoqoXZIubrtsmg~Cheap sushi, especially for all you can eat. But I've had my order "rejected" from delivery because it's too busy in the restaurant... definitely not good enough to warrant that.~sushi, ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~G_gBH9KC5I-S89kRZIRV-Q~Usually when reviewing Toronto sushi places I talk about how the food was bad but the service was amazing. Today it's going to be switched up a little. The food here was ok. Got a bento for $9.95. Three kinds of maki, all rolled properly, well seasoned rice, avocado and salmon were fresh. Miso soup was very savoury. Salad dressing was awesomely tart. Chicken teriyaki was fine. Spring roll was fine. Tofu was superb. Mountain of food for a low price. Only downside was that the tempura was horrendous. It was soggy.   When I walked it in took three minutes to be noticed, greeted, and seated. There were two servers and only four occupied tables (and they were standing about, not at the tables). There's no excuse. The menu is huge so a couple minutes later I'm still holding it in front of my face reading it and a server comes and says "Are you ready yet?" and I suppressed a "Yes, I'm just reading now for the entertainment value". I order and it takes too long to get to me. While waiting I notice there is a dinner ayce menu which was never offered to me. Oh well, not too hungry anyway, but would have been nice to be told about it. When she brings my food my water is empty. She looks at glass. Doesn't fill it. Ten minutes later she walks by, glass is empty, looks at it, doesn't fill it. Third time she walks by I ask. She still doesn't fill it. Five minutes later another server fills it. I must have tired out the girl by asking her for water because she disappeared but more on that later. As I eat I notice the floor is disgusting. Chopstick here, lump of rice there, no effort to do anything about it. I also notice the server that didn't disappear is just chilling up front drinking a bubble tea instead of working. I finish the food. Server walks by. "Are you done?" I say yup. "Can I get you anything else?" I say no. Wait 20 minutes, never see a bill. Get up and approach her. As I do I find server #1 sprawled out in a booth taking an effing nap! Can you imagine? Server two says "Do you want to pay?" and I suppress a "No, I'd just thought I'd do laps of the place to work off the bento". She starts looking at the menu and mumbling to herself. I don't have time for it. Drop 11.25 on the counter and walk out. No tip for the first time in my life. Won't be back.~sushi avocado salmon miso soup salad chicken tofu tempura tea ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~iytUb5Kmn4Rzrw1q0CprPA~My partner and I are regulars here and WE LOVE IT.  The food is AMAZING and cheap as it gets for AYCE.  That being said, if you are expecting ambiance and five star service, you're at the wrong place.   We have never really had an issue with service, in fact, because we are regulars, we have established a relationship with the regular server and the chefs; as such, when they are in we get special treatment (free drinks, special sushi not on the menu, etc.). Bottom line, for the price, the quality of the food is top notch but you won't get much else unless they get to know you.~sushi ~5
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~qgECDjUniBFWWAd9URpcHQ~Yeah this place pretty much uses pretty poor quality of fish and small cuts. We did not order the all you can eat either. This is what happens when instant gratification and starvation are mixed.~instant ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~8SnMY-R8g2uSc8ephzAAbg~WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE....  We went in for the 10.99 all u can eat...  The service was slow and sub-par  but this didn't really bother me... The food was really bad and the worst sashimi I have ever tasted...but still whatever it was only 10.99 right?  Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17.99, even though all of the banners say 10.99.  After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10.99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT....  This is where it gets good...  she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again.. I said fine...this is the worst sushi I have ever had and I wouldn't dream of coming back..she than barked  at me again.   At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me!!!   But it didnt stop there!  She then shoved me into a table...After this I unleashed hell fire on her and ran out.  I'm still pondering pressing assault charges just not sure if i want to waste any more energy on it... I'm still shocked it happened....Difficult customer or not you NEVER lay a hand on a customer.  The place was full as well with a lot of witness's.~sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~37l8oIEHZUaV2I9X6PoyrQ~The Good:  There are two options for AYCE. So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop.  The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area.  The Bad:  Way too much rice on the sushi. I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls! Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna?   The rolls were not well assembled. some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef.   We like to order a lot of sashimi. The first round of salmon sashimi was excellent. The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat. This cut of salmon is not normally for sushi. It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi.   The severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with. This is pretty typical for a lot of sushi restaurants in the area.   The Ugly:  When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food.   It took forever for our first order to arrive! I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.   ***The lesson here: you get what you pay for. *** This place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower. I like quantity when it comes to sushi, but quality counts for so much more.~chicken, beef sushi sushi. sushi, salmon tuna? sushi salmon salmon sushi. sushi sushi sushi, ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~erAzxMekYo3ob7wDRtVvBg~worst sushi place ever!  The food is not fresh (you can see black stuff on the avocado).  The fish is not fresh also, the taste is a bit weird.  There are orders missing so we have to order again. When the order came, there is soooooooooooo much rice on the roll (i never see that much rice in a roll).  Even the yam tempera is not sweet.  Worst place ever.   too bad i forgot to take picture of the food to prove myself.~sushi avocado) ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~uCZ2Gl1Es06pJaGeoweuhg~My buddy, Eric, and I come here for lunch pretty much every Tuesday and order one of their lunch specials.  They are an unbelievable deal.  For example, for just $5.25, you receive miso soup and a bento box with chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, 4 California rolls and two tofu cubes (somewhat sauteed).  Hey, you also get a bottomless cup of green tea.   We've been alternating restaurants in the Annex area for years but this has been the most popular for us.  Healthy and a terrific deal.  Can't beat this place.  And, after all these years, the staff knows us so it's kind of like walking into Cheers for us.  "Norm!"~miso soup chicken salad, tofu tea. ~5
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~nuVbfvnvNZCINM62ZJbrEQ~I've come here way more times than I can count, and I find Mariko to be a top-notch place for sushi on a budget. For just over $15 you can get AYCE of plenty-palatable fish (and whatever else you want). I eat a lot of salmon and tuna, and they are always good+. On a few lucky occasions I've gotten outstanding tuna that melts in your mouth like butter. I'm not a fan of the sushi pizza, but everything else I've eaten has been very enjoyable: dumplings, skewers, seaweed salad, various rolls, nigiri, sashimi. Ambiance is not great, and the plastic water cups sometimes taste like cleaner, but I find Mariko to be a solid sushi meal at a great price.~sushi salmon tuna, tuna butter. sushi pizza salad, sushi ~4
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~Tmbw91wwEEvImWuInLjSaA~This is the WORST SUSHI IN TOWN. DO NOT GO. Popped in before a movie which is the only reason it does any business I am guessing from reviews below. YIKES! I was in a hurry for a take-out order. TWO of us got SICK with BAD STOMACHS for two days! The place is FILTHY, starting with the front door, fingerprints, and dirty floors. A very bad sign. The first thing I clocked inside were the Chinese (nothing Japanese here) employees and owners' SHOES thrown on the floor in front of the 'sushi bar!' Only one couple in the restaurant. Mops are visible, brooms, and crap surrounds the food area. The first banquet is totally covered full with papers and plastic bags, there are filthy chairs that need to be tossed they are so dirty dirty dirty. The staff who wore dirty tops barely understood my order, and though the prices are good, the food made ever so slowly by a tired elderly Chinese gentleman (who looked as though he should have his feet up in front of TV not working) was the worst I have ever had. IGNORE any reviews that like this place, those are not people with any food standards whatsoever. FEH!~sushi sushi ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~-cBpNFMQ9j5RVWFFS56Heg~I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place. I have been several times and have always enjoyed the food and found the service to be very good. I have never had an issue with quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mariko.  I eat a lot of sushi and I have most of the sushi restaurants in the area. Mariko is as good as any of the others.~sushi sushi ~5
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~eMDr4icAhjLr27ItykHUSg~Why oh WHY did I let my stomach sucker me into coming here?  I know I say this about pretty much every Japanese restaurant except Japango, Asahi and Yuzu no Hana, but this has to be the worst one in Toronto.  OBVIOUSLY it is run by Chinese folk, not Japanese, which makes it all the more obvious why it sucks. I asked for a substitution and they said: NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap. *rolls eyes*  I ordered the Wakame Salad, which came drenched in a disgustingly sweet sauce of sesame. Not a drizzle, a SOUP of dressing covering the few leaves of wakame is not my idea of a good Japanese salad.  The miso soup was standard but I only got 2 tofu cubes.  I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully. It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all.  But I am never coming back, and if you had a smartphone (unlike me, as I am internet-less most of the time I am out of the house), you would have yelped this and avoided it like the effing plague.~salad, soup salad. miso soup tofu chicken soy sauce ~1
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~JlsjIHXAORjisRGQWPmuXA~Had dinner with some friends at Mariko tonight, it was.. ok.. certainly nothing special...  +ve's:  -even though the place was reasonably busy, the service was quick. -inexpensive  comments (not really -ve's, but close): - edamame and anything sweet for desert are a la cart and not included with the AYCE - kinda odd  -Water was brought to the table and we were never asked if we wanted anything else.  I certainly would have expected tea rather than water.  The refilling of the water glasses was labored at best.  -The sushi, sashimi, tempura, udon were all ok. The fish seemed a bit on the old side - kinda soft and mushy - maybe it'd been frozen? dunno.  The udon broth was kinda tasteless.  The tempura was not bad, but a little greasy - same was true for the gyoza, not bad, but a bit greasy.~edamame tea sushi, tempura, tempura ~3
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~dKgvPMaRTrDS_ykaZuye5w~I came for the AYCE and remind me never to go for all you can eat.  MSG induced perhaps?  I never feel like I get my dollars worth since I don't eat that much...  I've had their lunch specials which were ok.  Unfortunately I don't remember what I ordered but it was your standard annex sushi bento box...~sushi ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~LuO1i-mIvU93iYqpzA10MA~I've only been for AYCE, and while for the price I don't anticipate stellar service, I do simply ask that my request to have my food not come in contact with animal products be respected. I don't need sterilized separate utensils, but not having to return a large plate of avocado maki that is covered in roe would be awesome.  Even in my omnivorous days, fish and seafood grossed me out. This kind of experience doesn't really help the matter much.  The prices are solid if you have no dietary restrictions, and they've never once cut me off, even though I can devour an inhumane amount of food.  Go in with minimal expectations, and an empty stomach.~avocado ~2
-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA~G5NIX9pC1g3pQwNukCEA7A~I've visited Mariko on Bloor (near Bathurst) twice now, and was surprised to see it wasn't listed on Yelp yet.  My first visit to this location was initiated by their signage.  They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have "FREE DAYS", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).  Both times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.  The first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading) The second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.  The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL  We overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.  Later found out they had a conditional pass back in April '09.

2GoA-3SG9SnDmPi2MnxhaA~IHWHTZdWAc9tPsnfgcSrUw~I went to the West Side Market on a Saturday morning. Yea, I know. I don't really know what I was thinking either.   It was a chaotic, glorious mess of old and young Clevelanders bustling around grabbing local goodies. You couldn't walk 2 steps without accidentally tripping on a stroller. Let's just say it wasn't the environment for the easiest shopping trip.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that on days like that, you aren't expecting the best customer service from a swamped merchant at the market. But in a lucky twist of fate, Fosters Meats came through with the perfect amount of helpfulness, knowledge and patience. Hallelujah!   Jason, Kelton and I stopped by the WSM for a roast and some fresh bread. We didn't think it would take long so we scooped up the first 15 minute parking spot we could find. The first steps we took inside I was thinking we might want to move the car--with this crowd we were going no where fast!  We didn't move the car, but we did start to make our way through the crowd until we spotted the first meat counter, Fosters. We were immediately noticed and asked if we needed help! Wow. So, Jason quickly explained what we were looking to cook and how many we were serving hoping to get some guidance on what to purchase. The Foster's employee cut us the perfect portion of beef at the right price and it turned out delicious! He even worked with the credit card minimum to make sure we were happy campers and got us out in time to move our car!  Polite, quick, efficient, helpful and actually smiling! Yes, I as surprised too! I mean, if I were working on a busy Saturday at the West Side Market, I'd be one crabby broad. I could learn a lesson or two from the Fosters folks, that's for sure.~beef ~4
2GoA-3SG9SnDmPi2MnxhaA~YF-CcRNkjizBxZMQu8Cv8Q~I have come here for YEARS and I guess I've just gotten used to fabulous meats, helpfulness even on packed Saturday's and "thank you's" - today was even better!   Beautifully marbled beef short ribs, a gorgeous round roast, some ground lamb and a discussion about Denver cuts - all with the nicest crew in the market! Thank you as always guys!~beef ribs, lamb ~5
2GoA-3SG9SnDmPi2MnxhaA~a58sAq2UOmTSFy9oqxodLw~Two things need saying.  1. Lamb.  2.  Goat.  Sure, maybe not your favorites, but if you're looking for quality -- well, when I started buying from them a few years ago, I haven't bought lamb or goat elsewhere.  NOT THE CHEAPEST, but you're paying for excellent meat!  Courteous, friendly, but go either on Monday or Wednesday to avoid the weekend strangulation most people think of when they think of the WSM.~lamb. lamb ~4
9WnyLoPC_WzD25IPd4d7qA~NAO49E82sq-KpP0ob16eXA~It's a very authentic Sichuan restaurant, though with limited menu. The price is one of the reasonable in the city. 3 mains, 1 entrée, and 2 drinks only cost 30 euros.  Most dishes are spicy, better watch out for Sichuan pepper and not bite it.  A bit packed with Chinese; so, it could be somehow noisy.  Recommendation: Spicy beef salad~beef salad ~4
DVbKDiQYEvCymocLGniz9w~dgUmlNISihDwDp0Sw2Bxbg~If you want a crappy, messy job. Reymundo is your guy. He is a CON MAN. We bought a house at the end of March. Got his number through another contractor. Had him come out to measure and give me an estimate for granite work in the house (2.5 bathrooms, and kitchen). After 3 failed appointments, he finally showed up and gave me an estimate as said the work would be done in 7-10 days. Ok no problem. 3 weeks later and my granite still wasn't installed. Lots of phone calls, text messages, and voicemails and I still didn't have my granite. He finally got back in touch with me to install it at the end of April. Everything was installed so I finished paying him in full. I noticed the same night that there was a crack down the middle of the sink in the master bath. I called him and informed him about it and he said no problem he will have a replacement in 3 days. Here we are in JUNE and he still hasn't come back to replace it. He sparingly responds back to any of my calls/messages and when he does its "let me call you back later this week". At one time he even gave me a date of when he would install, and my husband and I both took the day off to make sure we were available for him and he never showed up.  He is a con man and if you wanna be ripped off, give him a call. I would give him no stars if Yelp allowed it. What a jerk.~date ~1
6qDdAp-9A4GqWHwprrK3Vg~aTv1t5IKqIk1hb0IVOSXig~3 different size washers 2 - 4 dollars a load. Bill to bill machine. Change machine. Places to fold your clothes. Plenty of rolling baskets to put stuff in. Lots of seating. Coke machine. Televisions located throughout. They even have comfy padded chairs. Pretty clean for a laundromat. Bathrooms located onsite. The only thing keeping it from five stars is that there is no way to get cash if you don't have some already. Also, there are not that many wall outlets for charging your phone, or whatever it is that you need one for. I suppose it is a lot cheaper than laundromats I have been to in the past. If needed, I wouldn't mind having to come here again. It is without a doubt the nicest laundromat I have ever been to.~coke ~4
6qDdAp-9A4GqWHwprrK3Vg~TJ5ZtfWEumGM5uByqfOeIg~Omg...do NOT go in there!! Especially if you are white! My fiancée and I went in there today with our service dog to wash his bed..qe drove all the way from Lake wylie because it has good ratings, is clean and I have had several great/helpful service experiences in there before. We were harassed, threatened, cussed at, had the police called on us, one male employee grabbed my when I leaned over the counter to look for a business card. This woman did not like us, or the dog I'm not sure, we were told to get the fuck out of there and physically threatened.  We did NOTHING to deserve this!! The black woman behind the counter claimed to be the owner. She gave no reason for why she would not allow us to go about our business. The screaming, cussing and horrible attitude toward us was not about the dog, it was a clearly a racially motivated act. Three black people or more ganging up on us, humiliating us in front of everyone. I have never gotten this from any previous employees there, but previously, it was staffed by several different Hispanic or white employees that were kind and helpful. These people had NO REASON to treat us this way or discriminate against us for either race or having a service dog.~white! white ~1
5R6aB5T6pDIlgam1nbibcw~MWunZ4CvCvYr91BaVxGWtg~The Fox Bistro is the restaurant at the Radisson so we were assuming that the food would be fine and gave it a try as we had a coupon for it.  As you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it is very dated inside, and the bar crowd. We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.  The menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna.   The waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?  When the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.  The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said "its frozen, we just heat is up" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?  I'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious but I will never be going back.~lasagna. sandwich, honey honey sandwich, lasagna lasagna. ~1
5R6aB5T6pDIlgam1nbibcw~POQqC8zatcU6gmEgaxy9gw~We went in this restaurant in the hotel because it was convenience, not my choice but my family's. Milestones and Swiss Chalet were too busy for them on a Friday night, no one in this place so quiet. Apps were good, nice French onion soup but small portion. Do not order sandwiches, very small portions on grocery store sandwich bread and small sides - not worth price. I make nicer grilled cheese sandwiches at home, without finger holes in the bread. While server was attentive, he overstayed his welcome. My family was on a stopover so it was my only night to see them for a few hours. The server lingered and made inappropriate conversations we were not interested in having, even going so far to joke about my RMT career and refer to me as a masseuse. We did not want to be rude, so we eventually left irritated. I served for 12 years and would never imagine lingering unwanted at a table making conversations of my own choice to pass the time.~swiss onion soup sandwiches, sandwich bread cheese sandwiches ~2
5R6aB5T6pDIlgam1nbibcw~CLM6Pra8cVQhKiZX6OrRRw~My girl friend and I stayed at this Radisson twice and were given continental breakfast vouchers on both occasions. We didn't have time to take advantage of it the first time but we decided to give it a try on our second visit.  The moment we walked into the restaurant  was like going through a time machine. Boy~ the decor was immensely outdated; it felt as if we had just gone from year 2010 to 1980's...  The experience pretty much went down hill from that moment and on... 1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.  2. The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled.   3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...  Well, I can go on and on about how bad this place is but I won't... You probably get the idea anyway... Stay away from this place since there are so many choices (and MUCH better) right outside the steps of this hotel (Tim Horton's, Kelsey's, Subway, Milestones, Sushi, Swiss Chalet and etc...).~breads, sushi, swiss ~1
5R6aB5T6pDIlgam1nbibcw~REETxyBrZU0JOar5hAwz7g~I'll eat anything. Don't get me wrong. I love great food. But I'm also not super picky.  This was terrible. Awful. First of all, breakfast isn't hard. But it was for them. The buffet seemed lackluster so I ordered eggs Bennie. It's kind of my "treat" when I'm traveling. I was informed a little after I ordered I couldn't have them because they were out of English muffins and ham. It's Thursday. Really?   So I opted for the buffet. The hash browns tasted rancid. That made me fear the eggs. They actually tasted okay. But by then I was put off. The bacon was half cooked and so greasy. And the sausages - well at least they were cooked through.  The muffins were stale and the croissants were undercooked (hint: they shouldn't be white).  I felt bad for the server because she seemed aware everything was crappy. She was at least quick to refill the coffee (which wasn't terrible).  I wasn't expecting 5 star dining but this was ridiculous.~bacon sausages - white) coffee ( ~1
95s7ZRceq-mYD-a7DZntnQ~S-JbWPzCCxgP288Ao-_qYQ~We contacted Grout Medic to address some discoloration issues with grout in our kitchen & master bath room prior to placing our home on the market. We waited a very long time to get an appointment for an estimate but the owner, Beth, was very nice. I was very specific with what I wanted to have done and it was very important to me that the replacement grout match the color of adjacent grout. We delayed placing our home on the market to accommodate their schedule. We let them know that our house would be shown to prospective buyers the day after their work was completed. My husband was home when the work was done but since he works from home, he was not able to constantly supervise the work (not that he should have to). When I arrived home from work, what I noticed was the mess that the workers left all over my kitchen counter. There were large gobs of caulk smeared on the counter and even on my towels. When I went upstairs to see the master bathroom, I noticed immediately in the upstairs that all surfaces where covered with a fine layer of white dust. Apparently, the workers did not close the door to the bathroom when they removed the existing grout. I also noticed that the color of the caulk did not match the adjoining grout. The grout was smeared on & was very noticeable. The ceramic tile in the shower had been nicked by the saw that had been used to remove the grout. This could not be fixed unless all the tile was removed. The caulk in the kitchen did not match either. Bottom line---no matter what they say, caulk does not match grout. Needless to say, I was furious. I had paid for what was a lousy job & had an evening ahead of me to clean the mess that was left. I immediately called the company & the lady who answered the phone was surprised that I was so upset. She assured me that the owner would call me & that we had the best worker on the job. The owner never called. Why should she? She already had my money. I have had to pay to have this lousy job fixed. I would never recommend this company to anyone EVER. I would give the zero stars~white ~1
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~yzD1H1grE7kE0ECD8QVhKw~A nice, clean bowling alley.  Most alleys have pretty much the same features as all the rest--lighted lanes at night, birthday parties, pizza and burgers, etc.  At Squaw Peak though, you get it all without the dinge and wear that I usually see at a lot of other bowling alleys.  The bathroom ain't scuzzy, and you don't smell residual 30 year-old cigarette smoke.  I went here with my family last night and had a great time.  After a warm-up, I bowled a 161--the best game I ever played.  I think you'll have fun too.~pizza burgers, ~4
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~B23RSdB3pLLf53R0mXVajg~If/when i go bowling, its up in N phx or N scotts. This place seemed out of date for an AMF. The screens are old school, and they don't have the stupid videos playing when you get a gutter ball.  We went last minute on a sunday night...it was more busy than i thought. Maybe half the lanes were full. The bar was open (I headed that direction first time). I can't complain about the customer service. Place was clean.  I guess just 3 stars cuz of  lack of cool vidoes, and disco feeling that i get at newer AMFs~date ~3
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~VvIaODGpxMpwd0VJUTnT2g~So, we  had a company party here last night, and we got to bowl 2 games.  There were quite a few of us here, and overall, things went smoothly without incident.  I normally don't hang out on this side of town.  To me, its kind of an older, slightly run down part of town.  Not scary, just.....old.  I don't know how long this bowling alley has been around, but it appears probably a few years.  We had several pizza's ordered while we were there, and surprisingly, the pizzas were tasty!  Much better then the last time we were here last year.  They serve beer, and thats always a great becuase it makes bowling much more fun.  I don't know that I would personally return to this location, as I really wasnt all that impressed. Its decent, but nothing that I would return to.~pizza ~3
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~rD3e4g92-yFXVHG3-3GNvg~I recently moved to the Phoenix area and joined a bowling league here. It's in an older part of town - but safe. The snackbar is small buy has a fairly decent menu. I had a burger and it was quite tasty - greasy just like a bowling alley burger should be.  The staff is nice. The scorekeepers have recently been updated from what I was told and do the job - nothing fancy. If you're looking for an "old school" bowling alley - a place to have fun without the attitude or frills then this place is it.~burger burger ~4
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~bBs8S_mpxccoynNZmHgJ9g~Bowling+ Alcohol+Rock and Roll+ Cool Lights = Good Times..and low bowling scores!!!!   So AMF is OK..I have experienced better.  This location is your typical hometown bowling alley minus the line dancing or Karoke on Friday and Saturday nights...at least that's what my hometown bowling alley had.  Oh wait so does this AMF in the bar...speaking of the bar...most of the staff here sucks and for the majority are probably older then this bowling alley itself, the drinks suck for the most part...the only thing I have had here that tastes halfway decent is the Long Island Ice Tea...but even a blind monkey could not mess making one of these drinks it is virtually impossible.   Prices are OK, the Rock and Roll bowling is cool but I think it is about time this place maybe did a remodel, all the balls are quite old and most of them need a good refurbishing. Plus it is kind of dirty, but what can you expect for a Bowling Alley..just go and look at the mix of freaks on any league night.   NUFF SAID!!!:)  I am still searching for a "GOOD" bowling alley.~tea... ~2
6pXwPMO871ir8ZnmyBbLEg~NSxgeRLeSgPJBInkK-8U_g~I suck at bowling, and yet I love it.  I love that I can like something some consider a sport.  I love that it's totally ok that you aren't any good.  A group of people who aren't good at something can have a great time doing it talking about how bad they are.    This is my designated bowling center.  Sure, we go lots of other places, but this is always a solid central location.  Plus, the fact that it's so close to the Biz is a definite bonus!  (I've had several years of "Bowling & Boogie" themed Birthdays...I'm a geek, but I'm ok with that.)  Though I've always called ahead just in case, I've never had trouble getting a lane or two here.  The food is fairly decent too in a way that only bowling alley food can be.  And what the heck is it about Bowling Alley bars???  My friend has a theory that the better the drinks the more games you'll play - both to keep drinking and then to sober up before you go home.   The facilities are a bit older, and you'll find a few areas that could use a bit of freshening up from years of wear, but I don't mind that kind of thing so much in a bowling alley.  Hopefully you won't either.~sport. ~4

After drastic changes in management, the service became horrible, and the prices started going up. I stopped going there, and it's been over a year since I had last been there.  I decided to give them another try. The quality of service has improved 100%. The girls behind the counter, were very friendly and efficient!   The time it takes to get your food is still very long. However the burger is made of fresh ingredients. The first time back, will not be the last time.~burger burger ~3

Their menu carries a good variety of salads, sandwiches and appetizers for a good price ($4-$9). The service is fast and friendly and the portions are generous.   Food tips: The papanachos (cheese, bacon, side of ranch), chicken tenders, black angus burger, and Philly cheesesteak are great options for lunch. And if you are really hungry... Make your sandwich a meal and upgrade your fries to papanachos for a few extra dollars.~salads, sandwiches appetizers cheese, bacon, chicken burger, sandwich fries ~4
7zqmeEgCPfvbxyaKHli6Dw~y7tGaq4CwuFEZb2nCh0jAg~More of meh food.   Real messy. Messy taste and can be pricey. Cheese and bacon fries aren't that great. NY wasn't great. Found a curly hair.   Just... Okay food.~cheese bacon fries curly ~3

My Jessica M. got the Cuban fusion. It was really good.   I'd come back but I would try the Philly and the fish and chips.   The place is in the food court of the Fashion Show Mall.~fries bacon chips. ~5
7zqmeEgCPfvbxyaKHli6Dw~A5v3bEWDluWFTHKPpmOISw~Other reviewers elsewhere complain of long waits and poor service, but we didn't experience either. Not the most friendly staff, but they were efficient and we had our breakfasts in just a few minutes. I chose the breakfast special - $4.99 (two eggs - any style - bacon ham or sausage, and toast) my eggs were "over-easy" and were done perfectly. My friend had pancakes - $2.99 and she said they were quite good.  Our experience was good enough to try lunch - big sandwiches that look quite tasty.~bacon sausage, pancakes - sandwiches ~3

After standing in line for what seems like hours at the Wendy's, I gave up and made my way to Jac & Ray where I was immediately greeted and helped.  I had the pita with chicken, cheese, mushrooms, onions and bell peppers.  The portion was very large and the flavors were actually really good.  Don't waste your time and money at other mediocre food stands and try Jac & Ray instead.~pita chicken, cheese, mushrooms, bell ~4
7f_edPZNJfP-kmUtFhIsOA~UN_qTtGa1LA0AVTk3sFflw~The Embellished Room offers an array of clothing for women looking for something trendy but not wanting to break the bank.   Every item here (with the exception of some sale items) is $29.99.  At this price, many of the finds here would be considered a steal, but for some items (like a simple t-shirt) the $29.99 flat rate seems a little over-priced.  I find the majority of their clothing is lacking in the quality department and I don't feel the price justifies the fact that your garment may or may not last you more than 2 washes in the laundry.  That being said, I do have a few pieces from TER that I love and have lasted me throughout the years.    Extra props goes out to the fabric bags they GIVE you when you buy something, and they don't try stuffing 12768 articles of clothing in one tiny bag.  (American Apparel- take note)  I would recommend making absolutely sure that you actually want what you're buying (try some stuff on, sleep on it, then come back to buy if you really want it).  Inspect the garment(s) and ensure there are no rips, tears, or stains.  Exchanging stuff here is a BIG hassle.  Note their return policy (as written on their receipt):    No refunds.  One time exchange only on $29.99 items with original receipt within 14 days and cannot be exchanged for other price point items.  If there is a price markdown on an item and it is being exchanged, the new price would be what the customer would get as credit when exchanging regardless of the original price paid.  Tags must be on item.  Sale/off season items cannot be exchanged.  Store credits are valid for a period of 3 months from the date of issuance.    The Embellished Room holds the right to change/discontinue any promotion without notice.  All products purchased must be checked by customer before leaving the store.  Any claims or damages after wards will not be allowed. Scanned register price will be taken as correct and final price.~date ~3
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~9LvJwdFXDpelNooLE9UDcw~When it comes to the actual product, the fro yo tastes incredible. The array of flavors is diverse and tasty, and I always find something I like. My favorites are the cookies and cream and cinnamon bun.   However, there are two reasons I can't give this place five stars. First, the staff is pretty unfriendly and rude. I walk in with a cheerful smile on my face and I am treated coldly by the person at the register.  Second, their sample policy is the most absurd rule I've ever encountered. You used to be able to grab sample cups and try whichever flavors you choose. But now, you have to go to the register, ask for a sample, the employee awkwardly stands there while you tell them which sample you want, and he/she serve it to you. Excuse me, but I am NOT five years old. I don't need someone to serve me my fro yo samples--no other fro yo place I've been to has done this. One night I walked in and the place was absolutely crowded with customers, but the employee left the register and a long line of customers in order to serve me samples. That's pretty ridiculous if you ask me. I don't need to feel belittled/patronized every time I want to get fro yo. And to be honest, this is the main reason why I've stopped going here.~cookies ~3
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~DJKLdNX79Mn4UDBE9X8lJg~Once, me and a friend were in Legacy Village just walking around after she had already bought a smoothie from around the corner. We noticed this place had just opened, because I was craving something sweet and was headed to Cookies By Design.  We stopped in, and it wasn't crowded at all, although the amount of employees standing around by the door was a little off-putting. They told us we could try anything we wanted...so the only one I tasted was their Cupcake Batter flavor and I instantly fell in LOVE! Who needs a man with the kind of sweet flavor and toppings Yogurt Vi has to offer? I was like a crackhead running back there every few days.  Once, I saw employees inside Whole Foods Market buying a bunch of organic strawberries for the toppings, so I know the rest must be good stuff.~smoothie cookies ~5
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~8qFkXu3R0HnKxOuisiWaXg~Eh..not too awesome.  The tart flavor was AWFUL! Way too tart and the texture was grainy and strange. Everything else (sweet coconut, taro, cake batter) tasted like a slight variation of the other. Very one-note. The only flavor that stood out as great was the cookies 'n cream. That was EXCELLENT and possibly better than any Menchie's flavor.  The inside was sterile and depressing. After being at Menchies, where they practically vomit smiles, winks, and good wishes, Yogurt Vi seemed like a very unfriendly place -- even though the people working there weren't. The other reason Menchie's is better is because they have twice as many choices.  That's about all that needs to be said, I guess!~coconut, taro, cake cookies ' ~3
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~wyXtmW1YhygW0JBoCDHq3g~I am a fan! I love the flavor choices and I love controlling how much I get. I don't leave there guilty. I get a small amount of vanilla, I know boring.... topped with M&M's. I love it. The other day I tried out the Cake Batter flavor and it was very yummy too with M&M's. The topping options are endless too, even though I only get M&M's :) The place is always tidy, which is hard to do with kids (adults too)  making a mess with the  toppings everywhere.~cake ~4
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~0UVvio_3IbYcDss_PVPgqA~I'm an original tart, fresh fruits kinda girl... and I also know that beggars can't be choosers. Before this place opened, my fiancé and I use to drive to Crocker Park from East Cleveland just to get froyo. Now we don't have to drive as far :) Unfortunately, the last time I stopped by---no original tart? Maybe the machine was down... So I got pomegranate tart instead, minus 1 star. I hope they bring it back.  Otherwise--- Self serve, very spacious, friendly staff, and clean.~pomegranate ~4
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~TAXZue_UEZjavCUbZW3Hog~Having been to many a Pinkberry and Red Mango, I have a pretty good idea of what fro-yo should taste like, tart, tangy and lightly sweetened. I was surprised at the large selection of flavors that Yogurt Vi had to offer, although only 2 flavors were "true fro-yo" with the tart and tangy flavor. The other 8 options were essentially low-fat versions of soft serve ice cream. While I applaud the shop for trying to appeal to a larger mass, I was a tad disappointed that I only had 2 options of the actual fro-yo, neither of which were the original flavor. Hence the 4 star rating. I did like the selection of toppings they had to offer, everything from fresh fruit to the typical sundae accouterments like hot fudge and nuts. The ambiance is much like that of most other yogurt shops, bright colors, clean lines and fun music playing. Since there are not many places on the east side that serve fro-yo, I'll take what I can get and this definitely fits the bill!~mango, ice cream. ~4
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~jVVLco9R6jd7qawqBu1IdA~Stopped by Yogurt Vi at their newest location in Legacy Village during their grand opening celebration. I expected the place to be mobbed - a la any Pinkberry I've ever been to- but...it was crowded but not unbearable, considering that they were giving away free frozen yogurt. Granted, the weather wasn't the greatest, but when I hear "free frozen yogurt" I go running.   Similar to other yogurt shops, Yogurt Vi offers a selection of tart and regular yogurt flavors. All but one flavor - red velvet - are fat free but all yogurts have the same pro-biotic benefits as non frozen yogurt. (at least until you slather chocolate sauce on top of everything)   There are more toppings than I can name here - everything from chocolate sauce, to fresh fruit, to candy pieces, to dried cereal. This is the Happy Dog of yogurt. You pay by weight, though...so the more goodies you pile on top, the more you'll pay. And if you're heavy handed with the yogurt machines (yes, you get to put it in a dish yourself!), you might not leave enough room for said toppings, so fill your cup carefully, k?   In my mind, Pinkberry is the gold standard of frozen yogurt shops, but the flavor of Yogurt Vi's tart yogurt is very similar to Pinkberry. I'm knocking off a star because of the self service nature of the shop. I saw a little girl touching the toasted coconut, and that's not something that would happen in a shop where the yougurt-istas dole out the toppings for you.   Hope this new yogurt shop does well!~frozen yogurt. frozen yogurt" frozen yogurt. frozen yogurt coconut, ~4
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~P3oAbR_rR6tYb6PGa35lxw~My girlfriend has me addicted to froyo, going 2-3x a week, and why not? It's a perfect summer snack, and it's healthy (when you want it to be). Yogurt Vi has been my go-to, and with good reason. They usually have a good rotation of flavors, and their toppings are superior (see: fresh) to the competing Menchie's in Woodmere. It's more spacious and aesthetically pleasing, has top-40 music blaring in the background, and is always clean. It just feels more polished. Clientele typically consists of couples on dates and swarms of teeny bopper girls.  There is a limit of two tasting cups per person at this location, but the trick is to just eat off the top of the cup and pile more on top of that. Taste away and thank me later.  Favorite flavors: Taro (!), Honeydew, French Vanilla, Cake Batter, Island Banana. Still waiting for rotations of Maple Bacon and White Choc Macademia, but at the rate I've been going, I can't miss it.~taro ( cake banana. bacon white ~5
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~CozDiQXweBAQufYFq1MO4g~I am absolutely addicted to this place. It has amazing, tart froyo, and a wonderful array of toppings. I've tried about every flavor they have, but I keep going back to the original and the cookies and cream. If you don't load it with fatty toppings, then it still remains a pretty healthy snack. Watch out though, some of their yogurts are not fat-free, so make sure to read the labels if you're watching fat intake.   This place is definitely a go-to for me whenever I'm in the area. Best yogurt ever, I can't get enough!~cookies ~5
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~_u923ljbXPcOZS2mWXZDug~Craving some Frozen Yogurt?  Look no further, Yogurt Vi will hit the spot.  This is a pretty straight forward review to write.  The flavors are plentiful and the toppings are even more abundant.  There is so much to choose from the hardest part is deciding what you want.       There is always a great variety of new flavors to try and the traditional vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors are always there if you're not feeling adventurous.  Some of the stand out flavors that I like are Cookies N Cream and the Peppermint Chocolate Mint in addition to the traditional chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.  It's self serve which is nice because you can mix as you please and also make your own size.  Sometimes I find a small too small, but a medium too much.  Problem solved!    The staff is always really nice as well.   Yogurt Vi is as good as it gets my friends!~frozen yogurt? cookies ~5
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~w3Nf_PGMphjz6JDglxrKQw~Hot gorgeous summer evening, just finished dinner, old rock tribute band jammin' out on the green. See lots of people w/ ice cream w/ fruit, which I didn't recognise, knowing the gellateria & Rocky's nearby. Had to check it out.   Place was packed! Staff very attentive, constantly sweeping through to wipe-off the counters, which were sullying fast with the volume of people crowding through that evening.   Interesting concept, some decent flavours, a ginormous plethora of toppings! But not the best I've had--some not enough tart, others too sweet...  Side comment on the brilliance of giving ppl large containers in a fill-as-you-go type joint. Of course natural tendency will force you to fill your pale to the brim!   Still, I'll probably be back, perhaps when it's less hectic & I can sit back, breathe, relax, and truly sample all the flavours.~ice cream ~3
0nGmFtth2sH01BfqP4C5zw~Clu5_I10Qq51REsLVeSx8Q~Yay. Cleveland gets froyo. Been here a couple of times.. it's always a place I have to stop by whenever I get a chance to go to Legacy Village.   When you enter, you can get 2 free sample tasting cups. There's so many flavors, and they keep adding more (recent one is the maple bacon one? Haven't tried it but will go and try it when I go back). They have the swirl and mix function too on the machines, so you can get two flavors swirled together! I've tried a bunch of their flavors, but I normally stick to plain tart.. just the way froyo should be. Grapefruit is also yummy if you want a little fruitiness to the yogurt. I love that unlike Pink Berry and Red Mango, you can self scoop your own toppings, and then get charged by weight. At the non self-serve stations, they give too much yogurt, and not enough toppings, but this is not a problem at Yogurt Vi.   So... my yogurt is always: a swirl of plain tart, lots of mochi, lots of fruit. They have popping bubbles as toppings now.. those are fun. They pop in your mouth when you put a bit of pressure on them. Not bad for price either, usually around $4 for me. I think they charge $0.46 per ounce.~bacon grapefruit mango, ~5
6KJJN6dm5T85foIo_pVKBg~7tY4Cksdo9wRN4EkVqHH5Q~Toronto dim sum is the standard by which all others are judged, not having had any significant amount of dim sum in China.  Even a dim sum restaurant owner in San Francisco agreed with me.  This is my favourite cheap dim sum spot in Toronto, and I've ne ver had a bad meal.  There are other places that are fancier or with a bit more variety, but you will pay significantly more.  Your choice!  I've been going here since it was called Imperial Gourmet Garden.  Then one day they closed up shop, changed the name on the door, and reopened with this new name.  All the same people out front, and presumably in the kitchen.  The dim sum has always been tasty, and quite the bargain during the week.  Pay a little attention to the cart-pushing-waiters...you might just learn a little Cantonese!  The beef ribs are excellent, and quite hard to find many places.  Also, malai go is super tasty...it's like steamed sponge cake.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  On a Sunday, get there before the crowds swarm the place at 11:30-ish.~beef ribs cake. ~4
6KJJN6dm5T85foIo_pVKBg~Fw0J6n_MI31kpVUm-4jSHw~The one Cantonese word I'm so proud to know is "shaomai"!  This Chinese dumpling is served as part of the countless dim sum carts at Yiu Wah Restaurant. Dim sum, meaning "from the heart", is an anytime food but best had from 11:30am to 1pm - that's when the carts are at high volume sending around your favourite dishes (which go for $2-3 for a small dish but when you get a whole bunch for a full table of hungry people, your very satisfying lunch will only cost you 8-10 happy dollars). The only thing is you might not see the same food carted around in every visit. They have their usual but when they'll show up is always a fun mystery.  There is an obvious language barrier here but so worth it. Don't be ashamed to just point and nod at food here. It's socially acceptable.  Among my favourites: * the aforementioned shaomai (w/ pork) * sweet & sour pork * steamed bean curd rolls * pork bun  A surprise hit with me: * crab balls  A MUST HAVE!: * garlic green beans (the BEST I've ever had ANYWHERE! But order this from the waiter once you sit down because this does not get carted around with the rest of them).  Also, get the table by the kitchen. The food is hot, fresh and it always goes to you first. Of course, you'll have to fight me for it should we be there at the same time.~pork) pork * pork garlic green beans ( ~4

This location always messes up my drink orders. My iced cap had no ice at all. It was just cool liquid. I was in a rush to the doctors so I didn't have time to go back. And then when my mom ordered last time, they used the table cloth to wipe the the edge of the rim when they overfilled it...The edge of the rim...where she was going to drink from...looks unsanitary. I would not have taken that drink had it been me.   The only redemption is that they make a mean grilled cheese panini. If I know I have to pass by this location, I always bring my water bottle with me for my thirst needs now.~cheese ~1

07AP_aqb2ygBfYJY-h4jKw~BvJR2pHcYXPSnSWgq8MlRw~My friend and I were just window shopping while waiting for a table at RA Sushi.  A hot read jump suit caught my eyes so I had to try it on.  Okay, so it looks better on a hanger than on me.  However, I found bunch of cute stuff.  The sales girl was super cool and nice.  When my friend was waiting for me looking bored, she offered her/us a glass of wine.  What a cute little Boutique and they had both reasonable & pricey stuff.  Walked out with two dresses. I'll for sure stop by Ruby next time I'm in Scottsdale.~sushi. ~4
1_yXNlfbGSn3pGjzNB99Yw~kDp0TnUgtT9RY5M8kiqq1g~My first time to the Boneyard ... and won't be busting down any doors to go back.    The place was rather empty on Tuesday night when we went.  I ordered the grilled porkchops, fries, and coleslaw.  My honey ordered the meatball sub and cajun fries.  We both came to the conclusion that we liked the fries ... regardless of the flavor.  The meatball sub was average.  The pork chops were grilled pretty well and had a good taste, but were really more along the size of a lamb chop.   One bite of the coleslaw and I was done with it.  It was a creamy based slaw with little to no taste.  I would bet we could find a pre-made container from one of the big-box warehouse joints.  Our server was very good and attentive.  She helped with the menu and gave us plenty of time to unwind from work over our beers before ordering.  If I could pair the server with a better food experience, then it would have been a much better visit.  Better luck next time when I try something different ...~fries, coleslaw. honey fries. fries ... pork lamb coleslaw ~2

1_yXNlfbGSn3pGjzNB99Yw~3bSk2OezS9s2GIhGS_Zo5g~Went here on New Year's Eve only because our first two choices didn't work out. It was practically empty. The first thing we noticed was that it was pretty cold in there. Either they didn't anticipate enough clientele to be worth heating the place or they figured they'd be so busy the body heat would warm it up. Either way, it was kind of uncomfortable.  My salad and my girlfriend's soup were both good so we got off to a good start food wise. My steak was good, though I was disappointed there weren't any dinner rolls. The baked beans I got looked a little pureed but they were very good. I wanted a baked potato but they didn't have any. I got mashed potatoes instead but didn't like them because they were chunky (kind of like potato salad).  My girlfriend said her steak salad was good, but the breadstick it came with was undercooked to the point it was cold in the middle. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.  The service itself was pretty weak. That would have been understandable if it was very busy but there were only a few other people there so that was disappointing. The bathroom decor was great but it was pretty filthy in there. Again, not sure how that could happen based on the lack of customers.  Overall, it was pretty good and I'll go back but they certainly have opportunities for improvement.~salad soup steak baked potato ~4
1_yXNlfbGSn3pGjzNB99Yw~UPHHS9IdVXW9vVkde2x_pw~We went because we got a deal on Groupon. The food was nothing special..like a normal American restaurant. A sports bar/grill.  Got fish n' chips plus a combo platter (half ribs and pulled pork). The deal was good for us because of the coupon.  But I was rather disappointed in their "Game Room". I was expecting something like Dave and Buster type of game room..but oh man..this game room was literally a 4ft by 3ft room with a few game machines....rather sad.  Probably not going to go back again unless we happen to be there for some reason.~chips ribs pulled pork ~3
1_yXNlfbGSn3pGjzNB99Yw~W8BTYWpQOfTQthnBKyLGMQ~We took the family and friends to the Boneyard last week after my son's game. The staff was prompt and attentive. Two people ordered the cheese soup and sent it back due to the fact that it was way too salty and had the consistency of pudding. I had the ribs, Big Mistake! The ribs were pre-cooked. Then reheated and jar sauce dumped over them.  The food is fair bar food at best. I went to the one in Broadview Heights when it opened and the food was very good. Oh my how far they have fallen. If you go there stick to burgers, fried frozen fish or chicken planks. I would put money that this place will close within a year. Fix the food fast fellas!~cheese soup ribs, ribs burgers, chicken ~2

The first warning sign was that at 4 PM on a Saturday Evening, the place was empty while every place around it was completely packed.  I ordered a Boneyard Burger and fries.  Fries were completely room temp when brought to the table.  The worst, however; came in the form of the Boneyard "burger".  The supposedly beef patties were grey and paper thin.  Preformed, frozen patties!  Seriously?  The patties weren't the only things frozen....There seems to be no one in the place willing to turn on the heat.  We never removed our coats the entire time we were there.  The server was pleasant, however.~burger fries. fries burger" beef ~1
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~HTxp-tGbBBTw6ERVu7cvPA~I came here for the first time a few years ago with my friend and have been back numerous times ever since and introduced other friends to it.  First off, the service is AMAZING! Staff are always extremely friendly and attentive and food comes very quickly, no matter how busy it is, although I usually go at lunch on weekdays so it is not overly busy.  The salads come in 2 sizes, small and large but small is definitely meal sized, I wouldn't order a large unless I was starving or sharing with somebody. My go to is always the Chinese chicken salad. The dressing is perfect and there's a good amount of chicken. I also recently tried a bite of my boyfriends salad, he got the seafood cesar. The name to me sounded bizarre but it had crab and shrimp and was actually quite good!  I haven't tried many other things on the menu because I tend to stick to what I like (selective eater over here) but I have tried their egg drop soup in the past which was very good as well as the roast beef sandwich.  I will continue to come back here as the prices are very reasonable, the service is amazing, and the food is always delicious!~salads chinese chicken salad ~5
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~H27_nONAOKgX5dSDFe21EQ~In a former life, I worked in an office not far from Dr. Deli and his arisocratic wife.   My colleagues loved the place. I was unmoved.   Dr. Deli violates one of my cardinal rules of dining out: they serve food that I can make at home. Salads? Sandwiches? Soups? Stuff I've been banging out since Home Ec class.   What's unforgiveable is that their food turns out worse than mine. Undercooked pea soup is grany; salad leaves arrive with brown edges, wilting under puckery-sour dressings. Coffee is zombie-grey.   Bread arrives with the standard packets of shelf-stable whipped butter.   I go to take one.   It's already open, and the butter is missing except for a crumb-laden smear in the miniature plastic tub.   They gave me used butter.   They can keep it.   Clearly, Dr. Deli requires better bedside manners.~salads? sandwiches? soup salad brown coffee butter. butter butter. ~2
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~nV07fXfP0CcQeMot34AGAA~Just came from Sid Silver and was hankering for some salad dish with meat (as I am a meatatarian) and we ended up at the plaza corner of Dufferin and Steeles because of Cora's.  However, I noticed this small restaurant in the back corner and checked their menu on the window and made sure there were actual customers as the one beside Cora's looked eerily empty so I did not bother going there.  Anyway I went in and ordered their Chinese Chicken Salad small sized for $6.99. I chose small because looking at the large size it seems like too much salad. I also ordered with their sesame dressing.  Along with the salad I ordered the bacon and cheese potaato skins as the appetizer for $5.95.   So I got the salad first. Surprisingly the bowl was not just for show, it was quite full. Lots of veggies (which I was after), some pieces of chicken, Mandarin orange slices, and some fried noodles. The tart sesame salad dressing blends well with the salad.  Don't throw the entire dressing into the salad, just do a little bit at a time.   However, something was missing in order to make me fully happy. Thankfully the tato skins arrived and after taking a bite, the taste just balanced very well.  No free wifi. However, I am happy with the price, service and quality. So I gave this 5 stars for this experience.~salad chinese chicken salad ~5
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~ePiTROmvBp4jxYNMxQf6nA~Super nice waitress, fast and friendly. I love their seafood salad with unique chinese chicken ceaser dressing. The best salad i have ever had. The omlette i have to say taste better than mine.~salad chicken salad ~1
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~nfd3T7neI8Ky4CD9sW_prw~If I only going review Dr Deli and the Salad Queen based solely on the food... I would have just rated this place as a 3 star.... but we got exceptional services from the waitress.   My Lunch buddy has this thing for soup...but she just couldn't decide which one to go with since there are 3 choices for "Soup of the Day"... While she looked to be for help and knowing me I am not good with deciding.. I asked our waitress for help...   1/2 Roast Beef and Soup ($6.95)  Waitress: Potato Soup is the Best..  Friend: hmmm how is the chicken noodle?  Waitress: Potato  Me: Beef and Barley...  Waitress: Potato  Friend: What is Barley...   Finally, we decided on the Beef and Barley...but our lovely waitress took out 3 samples for us to try.... I never have that happen to me... and finally after voting and intensive taste testing... We agreed on the Potato!! It is more like a really light broth with veggie inside and it was delicious!   I usually don't want to order anything with "Chinese" when I am in a non "Chinese" restaurant...but with all these reviewers raving about Chinese Chicken Salad ($6.95), I have to try it out! Small is Large! Me and my friend having trouble finishing that.... and there is nothing really Chinese about the salad...aside from those fried noodles..   The half Roast Beef sandwich on rye ended up I have to save it for pre dinner snack for later...   I definitely will come back here if I have another salad attack... and I would be bring my friend!!~salad soup... soup beef soup ( potato soup chicken potato beef barley... potato barley... beef barley... potato! chinese chicken salad ~4
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~MyfOJlpbOrKoezKJFCcVoQ~Dr. Deli and the Salad Queen, ah, good times.  This place has changed ownership more often than Paris Hilton changes boyfriends.  As such, I feel like the quality of the food has gone down over the past few years.  We used to come here all the time, and the salad was delicious.  But, I came here about a month or so ago (actually, it was one of the first places I went once I moved back from the states) and I was disappointed.  So, this review is based more on hope and memories - hoping that it's still as good as it was in the past.~salad salad ~4
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~PTdRGsrgtYSRFSXq9PneJA~Don't be fooled by the cheesy decor of this "hole in the wall" type of place, because I'm telling you this is one of the best lunch spots ever and I frequent it on a regular basis.   The Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent, and as a veggie option you can substitute the chicken with shredded cheese (which is also very good!) The salads are huge for the price, and be warned, a large can easily feed 2-3 people, while a small is the perfect size for 1.   Their salad dressings are incredible, and I'm pretty sure they sell them in big bottles to take home. (House Sesame and Ranch are my personal favourite!)  I've been told the other things on the menu are pretty good too, but I've only ever tried the various salads.   Now I have to say, the service is not the best, but the place is small so it's easy to flag someone over if you need to. The food does come quickly, but expect the server to disappear after you've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal.   Take out is always super quick, even if you don't call your order in in advance.~chinese chicken salad ~4
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~aCaXkCNBLdX2LTrLUuD6IQ~The only place to get a Chinese chicken salad that is actually good, this little hole in the wall is located in a strip mall at Duffrin and Keele. Along with delicious salads and healthy options, Dr. Deli also has great burgers and sandwiches. You will also get a kick out of the kitchy interior decor and the art that hangs on the walls (most items are for sale). As a regular for the past 10 years, Dr. Deli has been a constant spot for me and my friends.~chinese chicken salad ~5
HbZxMems5cEO8J1fBsw-sg~Grx1-tC5PjBZrwyqjTN6YQ~Dr. Deli is a great place for healthy food. They have quite a few variety of Salads. The best is Chinese chicken caeser salad (mix), the Greek seafood salad is also pretty good. I love the service, as it is so fast and good. I like the ambience, its not too rushy or loud.  Its not pricey, and the best place to come specially if you are diet conscious.  They also have some great meaty sandwiches, if you do not happen to like salads.

The vegetables are always brown and something is always missing when I pick up an order. Whenever I call to them about my issues they never really seem to apologize, rather blame it on me; "you did not tell me no sunflower seeds" (i did) "don't leave the salad in the car or the veggies get brown" (i never do) "my chef forgot to put in the carrots, I will give you extra next time" (I watched her make my salad, not a chef & my salad literally had lettuce, cheese and 4 mandarin oranges in it).

However, I am taking off 2 stars for the subpar quality of the 'caesar salad'. I opted for the carsar salad for an extra $2. I was disappointed with the salad as it only had some not so fresh salad and pieces of stale, perhaps home made croutons.    However, I do suggest the hot sandwich here, just don't get the side.~sandwich corned beef ~3
-HZ2VmNnnrH1tp-yKyhdNA~81obzdcf31R-f6QDoPgsdw~I came here and spent my life away in this beautiful store. The store smells like heaven on a sunny day. I bought all my souvenirs for my friends and family here. They have the most amazing creative soaps, shaped like cookies, doughnuts, cakes, pies, cupcakes, brownies everything. They have this bath balls that are similar to a huge sphere of alka-seltzer, they dissolve in the tub and leave your skin so smooth, I got to test the bath ball on my hands, so I definitely know they work. You can even place orders on-line.~cookies, doughnuts, cupcakes, ~5
-HZ2VmNnnrH1tp-yKyhdNA~4-AjrA3kOUjiH9ioG3jJtg~Super cute store with soaps I've never seen before! Couldn't leave without unique soap creations that looked & smelled like peach tarts, strawberry shortcake & banana cream pie slices...they look so realistic! Bought some home as gifts and people loved them!~peach banana pie ~5
-HZ2VmNnnrH1tp-yKyhdNA~kcwJzQ92l3YkDpIRZW9Etg~Love it here!  I honestly thought it was a cute bakery when I walked pass it but it turned out to be a soap shop.  Don't matter to me.    At first, I was only there to look but the longer I smelled and looked at everything, I wanted it all.  Shea was excellent and attentive.  She asked me what I liked and don't liked and she got it on the spot.   Very pricey.  Most of the dessert merchandise is made to look at, not really for usage in my opinion.  It would kill me if I use it.  They are just so beautiful.  I bought a "fruit tart" and a "peach tart".  They are both beautiful and the scent is divine.  Great to give as a gift which is what I did.  After I bought my items, I got some free samples as well as a beautiful wrapping for the soaps.~peach ~5
-HZ2VmNnnrH1tp-yKyhdNA~WPuo4e_PcMVH_BCXv17ESQ~From the window displays, I thought I was walking into a bakery. Slices of pie, chunks of fudge, donuts, and cookies all filled the front display cases. It was after actually walking into the store that I realized I was actually looking at handmade soaps. While my interest faded, my wifes peaked and we spent the next 15 minutes sampling products.  In the grand scheme of things, being located in the Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes, I expected the prices to be much higher. While some people would hesitate at $9 for a bar of soap, the crafting with unique presentation and ingredients made it justifiable. Definitely a cool place, and good for girly gifts to bring back from vacation. 5 stars!~pie, cookies ~5
5pJXye7SUjzLLiu7U9_WXA~J_woLGMv1XCYXent9MW1hQ~Oh Magia... You haven't aged well my friend.   About 10 years ago I spent a year living a few blocks away from Magia. This was my favorite local eatery within a 5 min walk.   A decade later, on a whim, I decided to return. It was kinda like running into an ex you haven't seen in a long time. A little fun for the first few minutes... but you're really left with "wow... What happened to her?". Sure the implants and Botox have helped, but it's just masking what once was.   The menu looks the same, but dementia has set in, they have forgotten how to make my old favorites. I started with the warm goat cheese salad. I used to dream of this salad at night! But what I got was, well, it was disheartening.   Anyway... I won't be calling her back. It was too awkward, and I don't see it getting better over the next few years either.~cheese salad. salad ~3
5pJXye7SUjzLLiu7U9_WXA~MTjd5_eco6eVvqqfwkoe4w~The food was very delicious. The waitress couldn't speak english so she brought us someone who could translate the menu as well. She helped us a lot actually. The only problem was that the pizza we ordered, one slice was slightly wet. The crust was soggy as if it had been dipped in water. But it was only a corner of the crust so I don't know what it could've been. Aside from that everything was good.~pizza ~4
5pJXye7SUjzLLiu7U9_WXA~D6qYMlzQbfy7kTdR6CBgAw~It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small. I had bruschetta, it was yummy. I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing! I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment. I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained.~risotto, ~4
5pJXye7SUjzLLiu7U9_WXA~vU51j-JW2KEbFcZeDkYKvg~In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil. This little strip is dotted with little shops and restaurants, including this one, La Magia.   The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners. The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas. I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11.95, very reasonable and done well. Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too.~salads, spaghetti pancetta, salad, ~3
7cCPL6NJPrOUlxjabpmZjQ~SBjSTgVSeEpGqEcXVzPxLg~I came here for the goats. Is it wrong that goats make me laugh and I find them to be the most entertaining animals out there?  Seriously though, we needed a destination for a bike ride and this was as good as any. I'd recommend this as an outing for or with kids, as there were many families there. But we met up with a family of friends and hung out with them so we didn't look like a weird childless couple cruising goats.  Ducks, chicken, pigs, sheep, horses and cows, too!  Make sure to leave some money in the donation box. This place can't run on fecal fuel!~chicken, ~4
7cCPL6NJPrOUlxjabpmZjQ~q1r_iDm9V0M2duOAzwZvLw~This is a small farm within the city, within walking distance of the Cabbage Town area. Among the things we saw: horses, roosters, a turkey, a goat, and lop-eared rabbits. It was very clean and scenic, and there are clean restrooms on site.~cabbage ~5
7cCPL6NJPrOUlxjabpmZjQ~LhpdZ5hvcZFuEEgZnBHrpg~just plain natural fun is what i say.  as cityfolk we dont get that many opportunities to go and see a cow unless its appearing on our plates with some frites, or a horse unless its being chomped on by our pets or even a goat unless we are slathering its milk-turned-chevre onto our bruschette.  so here is your chance.  take the kiddies and get close enough to smell all you like (for better or for worse) to even feed some grass to a pony or a horse (with supervision - you probably arent allowed to actually).  and learn to:  i didnt realize that pigs can grow that big.  i was quite happy she was fenced in and i was protected - easily a good candidate for a new batman movie villain.  i think that any adult will be just as tickled as any kid they bring along to have a taste of rural wildlife in this little zoo or farm (dont know that either moniker fits but it is what it is.)~milk- ~4
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~neSe6ErYGEyxsOyOHutw6g~We were the first couple to arrive of a party of 10.  The maitre-d' looked at us, nodded towards to the table and told us to seat ourselves.  Equally rude was the waiter who actually rolled his eyes at people who couldn't decide what to eat, and who got in a shouting match with one couple over whether a steak cooked 'medium' had any red in it.  On top of that, the two people that ordered the sea bass were treated not only to some cheaper, tasteless fish in the guise of a bass but both were sick that night.  I would highly recommend never going to this restaurant.~steak ~1
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~7NcuITGighxnn-z18jTiEw~A beautiful little restaurant with five-star-worthy food at very reasonable prices.  I had the chicken with oyster mushroom sauce, and my wife had the flank steak with plum sauce. The lentil soup was hot, very tasty, and a nice start after coming in on a snowy night. The entrees were simply awesome. After sampling both dishes, we both preferred the chicken, but that's not to say anything negative about the steak. They were both rich and intensely flavorful. Finally, the pear and chocolate cake with raspberry sauce was a great end to a memorable meal.  The service was good and the atmosphere was very cozy.   This was easily the best meal we had on our trip to Montreal.~chicken mushroom steak plum lentil soup ~5
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~7YHbtwVPbCpM4gnmr7xZAg~My husband and I had the best meal here. It is elegant, cozy and romantic, and the food is excellent. We had French onion soup,which was superb. I tried the duck confit,though I usually don't like duck. Boy was it great! Best of all, it is very reasonable. Loved it!~onion soup, ~5
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~4etxa1bbk33VjJVvPiqnug~Fries are burnt, the sole is frozen, the pastas are mushy, butter pasta for kids has peppers in it when you ask for 3 times for just butter. The waiter was nice, but the mediocrity of the food makes this an over priced proposition.~fries butter pasta butter. ~1
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~3npUD6CRrHex7inaQHVH4Q~I had the Pavé de saumon grillé, vinaigrette tiède à l'orange.  This is a grilled salmon dish that came with mixed vegetables and I believe orzo rice?  Everything was nicely seasoned.  The salmon was moist and flaky.   I saw some people getting a small sample of port.  I didn't get this when I was finished.  I guess you only get it if you order dessert.~salmon orzo salmon ~5
8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg~NgK5oL_9ibgzcg4AuPViFw~The receipt we came home with says Restaurant Le Caveau, but the location is not that mentioned on the yelp site.  They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.    Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.  we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).  On to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.  VERDICT::: very pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick. I would not go back if you paid me.~cheese mushrooms ( mushrooms ~1
0fJvj2LG6VWenkXEnAACVA~wrKvWSqvU54MfjHXgdQvbw~For the most part this was a very clean Tim Hortons even thought there was a funky smell there. The neighbourhood isn't the greatest so the people you see here after 10pm aren't the your regular hipsters from the area. Most of the people looked like they were miserable and that they were down on their luck. Saying all of this the coffee was up to the standards of Tim Hortons and I enjoyed my time there.~coffee ~2
0fJvj2LG6VWenkXEnAACVA~qo6EM24z8gKDgJuyROMibA~not very happy over this location, but its the only decent coffee shop in the neighbourhood, this location only gets a positive nod for me because of how clean it is. the service is lackluster, the staff are either extremely rude, or new. to top it all off the clientele of the area are not really the best to be around, often times found myself gagging in line from the uncleanliness of people that have come to this location. be sure to be bothered by people when you walk in and walk out for some "change" or something else.  not a fan at all.~coffee ~2
0fJvj2LG6VWenkXEnAACVA~9krODYcnQ16iDyVUTL3rbQ~Yes, it's a place serving coffee and doughnuts. It's mostly clean and always busy and hosts the traditional eclectic Parkdale clientele. In a pinch, it gets the job done, what else can you expect?~coffee doughnuts. ~2
0fJvj2LG6VWenkXEnAACVA~oGvNDMklWTYngzGswkdBmA~Parkdale is going through an invasion of coffee shops and a new one seems to pop up every now and then. In this gentrification wave, I was quite surprised to see a Tim Hortons appear on the scene a couple of years ago. They occupy one of the busiest and awkward intersections in the city - Lansdowne/Jameson on Queen Street West.   I stopped drinking their coffee long back but I still liked their muffins. However ever since they started flash freezing their muffins and using jam instead of fruit in their fruit-explosion muffin, I stopped that too. The only saving grace is that this place has free wi fi.~coffee coffee ~3
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~9PHK41n7SHfgqxuZqSmPjA~* Nice included breakfast *  Staying upstairs in the small yet lovely seven room Le Relais Lyonnaise (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hotel-le-relais-lyonnaise-montreal#hrid:tNEe9qqV1iexbFUbNqaS8g), the kind owner explained that he also operates this cafe, and that breakfast is included for guests in this public cafe.  (That was a nice bonus as when booking the room there was no mention of a free included breakfast.)    My review is only for the breakfast as I didn't come for any other meals or for the attractive selection of desserts in the displayed fridge (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=WVECS2J92y8C0xZqD2aA-g).    Every morning during my stay I had a bowl of cafe au lait and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=JIEPOJeoTRAPB0MBK5b_lw  The breakfasts were quite hearty and ranged from omelets (I had a nice cheese and herb omelet one day) to crepes to bagel with lox.    My favourite breakfast of the bunch turned out to be the bagel with lox.  They served a fresh bagel covered with a very generous amount of lox.  Cream cheese was served on the side, along with a side salad (typical mixed greens like from a market served with a nice dijon mustard based dressing) and some fresh fried potatoes (these were exceptionally tasty).  I've never had salad and potatoes with my breakfast bagel before, but it somehow worked and turned into my favourite breakfast offering at the cafe.  Here is a photo of it:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=8ldkGMWDtAFMo5NidT5EfA  I like the whole idea of stepping out of your room, going outside and heading to a regular cafe, yet being able to order whatever you'd like from the menu.  Nice additional touch for staying at the hotel!~desserts cheese cream cheese ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~B7UNID4-MwJ8D-OAIL56kQ~Four stars might be a bit much, perhaps three and a half, if it were available, would be my ultimate rating. My mother, who used to work here in her younger days, swears by this place, and although it has changed considerably over the years, the care and technique put into the food is still there and you can taste it. While I wouldn't consider this place for dinner, it is the perfect early lunch/brunch spot. Nothing fancy, but damn good crepes, croque monsieur and the paninis are also quite good. Side salads are always fresh, excellent dressings, coffee is excellent, and the selection of desserts, chocolates and glaces are also wicked. As a chocolate chef, I can say the chocolate here is definitely worth a visit. Somewhat pricey for lunch-fare, but the portions are decent and the quality IS there. The service is sometimes cold, and it can get slow, but mostly you get what you pay for.   Definitely a fan. Great terrasse as well.~salads coffee desserts, ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~Syimy2FynXzFlFp7mSQaQA~I personally cannot agree with the earlier two reviewers of this place...I thought the food was quite good. I highly recommend the quiche and I have it on good authority that the sandwiches from this place are much better than NYC cartfood...I guess it all depends on your expectations, this place is French, not typical American.  I recommend this place for breakfast or lunch...wouldn't really want to come here for dinner.~sandwiches ~3
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~V9_Bev0qvgrOwqx8R5TxOQ~Their crepes are amazing, coffee is delicious. A place I visit regularly in Montreal. Nice atmosphere. I love to sit and take my time when I go out, my family is typically European, and Ive never experienced a problem with the wait staff. Would not come here for dinner however.~coffee ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~zE5tuxvV82RV5wIge8Om-Q~The staff was very friendly and the service was pretty fast but everything we ate there was definitely under flavored and overcooked. We got the croque madame, deux oeufs (two eggs), and salmon omelette. The salmon didn't taste very fresh and the Croque Madame was pretty stale and merely a ham sandwich with an egg on top. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it's not a restaurant I will probably go back to/recommend for people in Montreal.~salmon salmon sandwich egg ~2
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~S5usNPrDOrtlcG5xHYAOCQ~Pastries, sandwiches,light lunches. Terrasse outside behind patisserie. Late evening treat seekers beware; virtually nothing left by then.~pastries, sandwiches, ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~0J_lhWbDugUfZWXCVcC1qg~Their buckwheat crepes are fantastic  - huge and delicious. You  won't leave this place hungry!~buckwheat ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~9tVSCLZARJV7BXPTcwnXXw~I have been here a few times but admittedly not in a couple of years.  So Yanik might be right that the quality has gone down in.  That said, this place has been my go to spot for croissants and coffee when I'm in Montreal.  I am very picky about my croissants, they need to use only butter and lots of it.  No margerine.  Good ones are hard to find.  So I would go have my croissants and coffee and read the local papers.  I cant speak to the lunch menu.~coffee butter coffee ~3
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~DXlufEptCiQYXXqu-EBzsw~This place used to be a very good spot in Montréal. When I was student, I went there many times per week. At that time it was only a place where you drink coffe (expresso machine, of course) and eat pastries. The choice was astonishing and they were made by highly skilled people using the very best ingredient.   Today, you can go there for a whole meal, not just café and dessert but the atmosphere is not the same anymore. The place has been sold and the original owner (a French lady) is not there to keep the place up to the very high standards that used to be.   Yes, now you can enjoy salad, croque-monsieur and soups, they even have added the ice cream to the menu, but each time I go there (2 or 3 times per year), I see that this place is just a shadow of what it used to be.~pastries. salad, ice cream ~2
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~hr6vwmmo1yvQXwbC3A12Tw~ARGHHHHHHHHHH   We only ended up here cos it was listed in "Montreal's Top 25" guidebook.  (Do people who write these guide books actually eat at the places they review?!!!!)   Dont bother going to this place - cos if you walked a little further up, there are tons of better looking places with better looking food.  The service here was slow.  They took FOREVER to take our orders.  The food was not worth waiting for.  The soup of the day felt so thin that it was as if someone had just poured water into a pot of leftovers.  You could get better sandwiches off a street cart in New York.   They took FOREVER to give us our check.  Nuff said.  ARGHHHHHHHHHHH  Dont waste your time here.  We hopped onto the subway to find this place because it was on the recommended list.  Dont do it!!!   We did and we regret it till this day...........~soup sandwiches ~2
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~IBpHRdZD2fWFn1bUAc_TOQ~I was staying at hotel a few blocks away. It was our first night in Montreal and it was beautiful. We came here and sat on the terrace. I had a smoked salmon panini and it was delicious. The meal came with a large salad as well. The food wasn't the most amazing ever, but it was good enough and really it was the atmosphere that I enjoyed the most.~smoked salmon ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~NWG7mDiGrUXJvNsLanJOlQ~I might be being generous, but the crepes hit the spot after walking all over old Montreal. Crepe, salad and cold local beer. Outside sitting, people watching on St. Denis. Stayed for a pastry and coffee. All were very good.~salad coffee. ~4
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~VpRik6VBiSwWQ6mg8vYMOA~Walking down St. Denis is an experience within itself.  You might get swept up in the romance that is Montreal and innocently assume that all restaurants on the street are going to be delicious and serve quality cuisine.  This is not always true.  Sure, the atmosphere helps, and the cafe diners on the front patio appear to be enjoying themselves.  But, once you taste the food being served, you may not be sold.  They serve fresh squeezed juice, so everyone at the table ordered it.  Not realizing that we just spent almost $20 on juice even before ordering food.  The fabulous looking bread and pastry counter is not filled with items made in house, but made elsewhere.  Instead I was served a decent croissant, but nothing worth mentioning.  The worst part of the meal were the buckwheat crepes.  We had buckwheat crepes a few days before at a different restaurant across the street and loved them.  So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.  The chicken inside of the chicken pesto crepe was cold and dry, and barely any cheese to soften the blow.   I simply could not eat the dish, and everyone else that the table felt the same about their dishes.    The worst part is that the brunch for three people was $70 CAD.  It was a tragedy!~buckwheat buckwheat chicken chicken cheese ~2
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~5wTn2zWYKJR1S1ENvJ5aKw~My wife said the brioche wasn't genuine and was in fact just pain au raisin. Either way it was OK. But not mouth watering. We had crepes as well...which were...well crepe like. Pretty hard to go wrong with this stuff. The cafe au lait was very nice indeed though. Service was quick and the waitress very pleasant. A good place to go for a snack and a coffee, but nothing special.   We were a little disappointed as our guide book said this was the best brioche in Montreal and we kind of went out of our way to get here.~raisin. coffee, ~3
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~kpKd51hx313nyMKgoInzuA~Never have I walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay because of bad food. NEVER. Until now.  We were in a hurry so stupidly decided to just go for lunch in the first non-chain restaurant we found on St Denis. BIG MISTAKE. I sort of blame myself as if I had actually looked at this place more clearly I would have noticed how grimy and dirty the outside was. It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.  Service started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.  I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!  Stupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.  The food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.  What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We really should have just gone into the Subway next door.~coffee ( french toast french toast french toast. milk, milk french toast steak cheese white french toast. ~1
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~1s1M5ZCn8P8ceRQ6t7IfBA~Worst crepes ever. Lack of stuffings. Lack of taste. Lack of service. My wife took the pork chops... same thing. How can you miss a pork chop. And the fries looked like McCain's fries. Overcooked. Oh well, that was the last time.~pork pork fries fries. ~1
28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ~87RX3ibeI-V7HdOWwrr0FA~Before I put in my 2 cents in without considering that I was in fact, in another country, I will review about the food first.  -Crepe: I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste. It is wrapped and presented in the most beautiful way. The taste was not so great, but this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget.  -Desserts: I cannot list all of the desserts I have tried here, because that would be an entirely long list. Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious. I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts.   Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends.  Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress. Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it. I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences, but I just realize that it wasn't and that this place is just poppin' and busy as can be.   No doubt about this though...people are nice and helpful in Montreal..a very nice change from the city life.~mushrooms, egg, tomato desserts desserts ~4
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~8TasJyCIYFapMls6K3xJ0g~Let's talk food.  Started with the wings and they were very good.  Ordered the ribs for dinner.  They were not so tender and the flavor is just not that great, to me. The cole slaw fell flat.  No zest, no zing, flavor just not so great.  The fries were great.  Husband ordered the Steer Here sandwich and said it was pretty good, but he also was not a fan of the slaw.  Atmosphere was good but we left before the live music started.~ribs fries sandwich ~3
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~XrT-nRq7vky2UibkEHrFdw~I had dinner at this establishment while waiting to attend a show at Stand-up Comedy. Being the country girl that I am, I was in heaven! The layout is western through and through. A band was setting up, but unfortunately I didn't get to hear them. The staff were all very pleasant.  I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken. Nothing spectacular... It is a bar you know. I will go back though, there are other things on the menu that I would like to try. Plus, it seems like a very fun, toe-tapping place to get ya booty-scoot boogying on!   Plan ahead for parking.~salad chicken. ~4
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~JR9o1aKYY0OyiTvSeKLjBQ~Loved this place! Saw a band play and had delicious food. My only complaint was having to flag down the waitress for EVERY request. In her defense, the place was buzzing.. But we wouldn't even see her for 30 mins at a time. Pulled pork sliders with pineapple slaw, onion rings, fries, and drinks are TASTY!~pulled pork ~4
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~_yDoSNW-AQ9GxtvNaJ3B5Q~We walk in and nu-metal is blaring from the speakers. That wasn't even the worst part.   Went here for a free show--a touring band from Norway. The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar. I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up. I then asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me. I then asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board.) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, "it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?"   I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO. Big mistake--the "buckshot" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup.   Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke. I seriously felt like I was transported back to middle school--who does that? I got the feeling that these two weren't happy with the crowd nor the band--but that shouldn't really matter. The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band. Why the attitude?   Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables. The lead singer says into the microphone "are we being kicked out?" to which she gets no response. The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc. I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable. These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away but also the headlining band.   The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a "buckshot") and the service, well the service was non-existence. I felt like the duo was put out by my presence. Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away.~corn ~2
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~HU1ZHjCUEAik-y2hBBpcdA~This is so my kind of place. I'm not even what you'd consider a "country girl" but the laid back, fun-loving scene with tasty beer, grub and music is totally my style. For some reason I've seem to be into taking my cowboy boots everywhere and have fallen in love with the western scene, so I like to drag my kicks out on the dance floor for some dancin. The live music is great and people are totally down to boogie. Not in the bump n gridn kinda way you see all over Old Town, but in the get your ugly funk on kinda way.  The food is definitely southwestern comfort food. Not a whole lot in the way of meatless fare, but I've only eaten here once. The deep fried grilled cheese was, well...exactly what you'd expect. Pretty good. Love me some shoestring fries and I could probably just have those for a whole meal. The jalapeno mac n cheese was surprisingly spicy in a good way. Beer and wine selections are both terrific. This spot is totally becoming a regular weekend hangout!~cheese fries jalapeno cheese ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~TzOtLdyS5XzTr8Bq1VU4UA~Taco tuesday is awesome! It's a little off the beaten path in old town and the type of people that come here seem to be good people. One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale both because of the service, tacos, Shiner, and the very cool look of the place.~taco tacos, ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~ZNUY45ynHH2grLD9Ag59mA~This place is a hidden gem!  You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close.  Did I say LIVE music? yes, I did. We went there on a Saturday night, I guess the weekend it opened. It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club, which by the way if you have not tried, must go!.   The place is small but they had a full bar, nice décor and great service.  So it won me over.  Must try the Texas Frito Nachos.  so good.  the hush puppies lack flavor, but I'm not a fan of hush puppies in general. My companions liked them, then again if you're drunk, anything fried is good.    They have a small dance floor in front of the stage, so bring your cowboy boots and start two-steppin!    The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air.  I'd go back to enjoy the live music, drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price.~nachos. ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~PSYQKl7D2CFk32pVRkwWLA~Great Venue, Good Food, Terrible Service.  Short Review: We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill.  Long Review: We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western, but after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue. We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage.   We sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention.   After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, "Sure! I'll bring that right over!" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal. Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill.   Maybe we picked a bad table. Maybe we picked a hectic night. All I know is I may be back to see a show, but I definitely will be eating somewhere else beforehand.~coke ( cheese burger. taco bell. coke. coke ~2
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~iDTwCvgOfZtK9QozV6qUuw~Very. Good brisket, quest, and burger. The ambiance is very dark but pleasant. There is a good sound system and entertainment many nights. There is a nice dance floor for when dancing is available; most of the recorded music is certainly good for dancing county and western.~burger. ~4
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~4QNeJPdKzDyJUne-Ja_YpA~Great live music and atmosphere. wings were excellent, but portion size was small. I would have liked to see 10 wings as opposed to 8, since the charge was equivalent to the burgers. For dessert we had the apple cobbler which was amazing. I would definitely order that again.   The service was excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and quick.~burgers. apple ~4
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~MMasUwAu432sBlgMxsKyLw~Love this place. Great food, good beers, fried oreos! Had the wings and a burger this time. Not terribly busy for dinner but should be if you ask me.  Service was outstanding and if we were in the mood we would have stayed for the music that was setting up during dinner.  Great non-stereotypical Scottsdale scene for Scottsdale.~burger ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~eLDKTkx4UT275x4S546ZEg~Just spent a few hours here and it was a fine place. They had a country band playing on Wednesday and they were decent enough if you like that music. Some good happy hour beer deals - i believe domestics were $2.50, although they never gave me the 50 cent change. It's like they undercharged me - strange. Tried the nachos and they were a fairly big portion loaded with ground beef and lots of black beans and sour cream. The sauce was a cheese sauce, not real melted cheese. Another gorgeous bartender was patrolling behind the bar as well. Not crowded at happy Hour. Kind of hidden away on 5th - they need a bright sign or something.~nachos beef black beans sour cream. cheese cheese. ~3
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~gB7V25xR8ImZg1RJH7d5vg~Don't go here for the food or the service! If you like to drink and country music then this can be fun. The food is mediocre and service really really slow. It took an hour and a half for me to get a kale chicken caesar salad. And when it came there was no kale and when I asked the waitress she said they took it off the menu. Thanks for telling me that when I placed my order from their menu with that salad on it. Hmmm. And my sister's burger was suppose to have a fried egg on top.  When they served it they forgot to tell her they ran out of eggs. Okay..... Wtf!  They should just shut the kitchen down and serve drinks with the live bands. The rest of the food in my group was bland and the manager comped the food because "they couldn't handle" business with another party of 75. Our group was six people. Not our problem!  There are way too many fantastic places to eat in Scottsdale. We don't need this lame excuse for food! If they stay in business it will truly only be due to the music and drinks. Scottsdale!! This is your official WARNING! Don't eat at The Western! Your welcome.~kale chicken salad. kale salad burger egg ~1
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~tJHCRGDJzphBoxT0grCNaQ~Omg, om-nom-nom-nom!!!!!  I typically do not eat BBQ, but sweet mother mary of jesus....YES, YES, YES!    Why is this place so awesome?  1. I actually met the grill master THAT GRILLED MY FOOD!  I met the man behind the delicious-ness that was my meal; he is amazing. 2. The staff/bartenders are cool.as.shit.  Seriously, they work in old town Scottsdale AND they are nice / pleasant / outgoing / cordial / amazing.  Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale?  3. They were really nice to my mom.... That gets kudos in my book. 4. All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got); it was all ahhh-mazing!  My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it.  I ate the pork butt sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan.  5. I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised.  :)  6. They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm....half off appetizers + cheap drinks.... Will you marry me Mr. Western?  In conclusion, this is a newer place with live music, awesome food, and even better staff.  So.... Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES!    My mom loved it, I loved it, my brother loved the left overs.....and we will be back.  :)   Thanks you guys!!~salmon salmon corn pork coleslaw ribs chicken appetizers ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~zMW4nH0DoyQTPQ4CJqpZoQ~Fried pickles and Ranch! I love this place. I can't wait to try the free dance lessons on Wednesday nights. The food is delicious and the vibe is so laid back and welcoming. I love that it's a bit outside of the busy nightlife area of old town/ downtown scottsdale. Everyone who works at The Western is really nice and the live music is great. get the fried pickles, a burger and one of their awesome drinks and enjoy.~fried pickles ~5
DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA~NUHX_7M08-Agnz2iz1pxvw~If you have ever dreamed of an heirloom tomato salad with chicken, it's from here.  I'm obsessed--I'm quietly pining for it now.  As far as live music goes, this place has two flavors: their usual, western-type stuff or outside-promoted shows like Saintseneca, Say Hi/Big Scary, Shakey Graves, etc. I have only been here on the latter-type of night and it was always great.  If you manage your expectations appropriately, you will always have a good time. Check ahead about the music if you're a snob either way.  Love the community tables, love the bison head, love the wallpaper, love the stage, love Eric the bartender, LOVE.~tomato salad chicken, ~4
8DmLIFcVBHqjp8XPXRQ6lw~T2ns_48BqePaA7Fl-boODw~Gotta love Thomson House! Good selection of beer on tap (yet not a microbrewery) and cheap good food. Good place to get pitchers with the guys, stop by for a meal, or just hang out and work. No undergrads allowed (perhaps if accompanied by members of the PGSS). Daily specials on the menu are a hit. Most dishes I tried were excellent for the price. The only one I was ever disappointed by is the poutine which is not made with french fries, but with wedges. Granted, these are OK wedges, but I don't like them in my poutine. Service is usually ok, but when it get's crowded, it can be hard to find a server. Love the balcony in the summer!~french fries ~4
8DmLIFcVBHqjp8XPXRQ6lw~5SrIP-DcK5YaTaGIGCGdnA~I've attended one event at Thomson House and helped to organize another. Both times the staff have been friendly, helpful and very professional, the facilities are attractive and clean and the food is very tasty.   The Ball Room is excellent for speaker events and receptions - it's where I've attended both events. I've also eaten in the restaurant on the first floor, they do a pretty decent burger.   Definitely my favourite venue for events at McGill.~burger. ~4
8DmLIFcVBHqjp8XPXRQ6lw~wcB-ZMpX-UUBecehZePUnA~Thompson House is the student lounge for McGill graduate students,  It also includes a ballroom which can be rented out for events like weddings but you might have to be a member to take advantage of that.  It comes complete with a bar and restaurant and is quite upscale for a student lounge.  There are comfy armchairs and couches everywhere so it is quite common to see people coming here to work for a bit or just meeting friends for a quick drink.  Being a student lounge food and drink is very reasonably priced.  The food is generally pretty good albeit the portions can be a little on the small side.  I guess there has to be a tradeoff somewhere though.  You can expect your typical bar food (pizza, sandwiches, etc) here.  The location is its downfall.  It is north of Docteur Penfield on McTavish so it is quite the trek to get here.  In colder weather this can be unpleasant.  You also have to be a member or the guest of one to get in.   The only way to become a member though is to be a grad student or post-doc at McGill.~pizza sandwiches, ~4

3lnfKVlzB7tbAtQsEvMQbQ~uShp_t3XyCYdmYPhNqEevw~Flavor Chalet was one of the food tracks being served at the Capital Lawn. I order a side of french fries and grilled cheese. The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries. But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on. He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese.   In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left. He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders. He was the only person running the truck.   The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky. He didn't used american sliced cheese, but used shredded cheese. He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's. For these two orders, I paid $12.50.   In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings. I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it. That cost him $6.   Took a total of 20min to get my order. I would avoid this place.~french fries ~1
3lnfKVlzB7tbAtQsEvMQbQ~u5GBC32Qogw3SZrNEUB8hg~This was the worst experience at a food truck ever! All of the "Specials of the day" items that he had displayed on his white board were not available. He was out of everything! He heated up one last hamburger patty (not fresh) for my young daughter and put the patty on a stale hot dog bun! No lettuce, no tomatoes, etc. I asked for a plain bean & cheese burrito for my other young daughter and he put rice & curry in it! Hello?! what part of PLAIN beans & cheese did he not understand! He then wanted to charge me FULL price for my order plus the burrito and hotdog hamburger. I told him that it was not a fair price and he was arguing with me about it- I will never eat here again and I will let many friends know about this experience!~white hamburger patty ( patty hot dog lettuce, cheese burrito cheese burrito hamburger. ~1
8Q9Y89Gc61LDENgyND4ygQ~UZYOVp9c9CYzNvER4rgc_w~This review is for the sports book and specifically for the football season.  During game days, there are $2 beers and they have a good selection on domestic beers and Coronas.    The sliders ($3 for 1, $5 for 2) are a disappointment and I've tried them on 3 separate occasions.  The ciabatta bread doesn't seem to be the proper choice and the meat is dry and overcooked.  The condiments are excellent, which is why I keep on giving them another chance.  I wish they would simply return to the traditional hot dogs, but they are trying to distinguish themselves from Station properties.  There is a food court right next to the sports book and you can bring food from there.   Additional positives are you don't need a reservation for a small television and you get a free drink ticket for a $20 bet.~ciabatta hot dogs, ~3
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~UWrpaNLHLPTGP9FmZQAfag~I stubled across this place on Leith Walk by chance as it isn't obviously signed nor is it well established yet in the area.  It's aiming for a fresh, Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian.  Inside it's clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients.  The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas, calzones and pasta dishes.  I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing.  The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese.  Not only was it tasty, but it was filling too and only cost £4. It's a shame Elm Rose doesn't do more business as it offers friendly, quick service and great food at reasonable prices.~sandwiches pasta pineapple pizza cheese. ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~zGnm60aMWITIQ_CB4rg0gg~Whilst out and about today, I stumbled across this little cafe, situated on Elm Row at the Calton Hill end.  I decided to give it a try, and was not disappointed.  The inside is small, with around 5 or 6 tables set out, each with a couple of chairs.  The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller, with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back.  They serve the normal cafe range of items - drinks, small cakes, and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as well.  Staff greeted me with a smile, and though I only bought one small piece of cake, I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food.  I find the shops on Elm Row are so easy to miss, as they are set back from the road, but if you venture in, you'll find gems like this.  This is the sort of handy little place you'll want to keep coming back to.  First impressions can be everything, and they ticked the boxes for me.~sandwiches cake, ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~PNjTJXSctLgX-U7ivl1TpQ~Elm Rose, with its neat Rennie Mackintosh styling, offers good quality soup, sandwiches and other lunchtime treats. It's well worth a visit, next time you're in the neighbourhood.  Overall, we said: "Elm Rose was pretty good. I don't think they're offering anything too outstanding, but it's a place I'd happily pop in, next time I'm passing. There's much to be said for places that keep things smart and simple, and that's the category into which Elm Rose neatly fits."~soup, sandwiches ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~AuSs1up2QiNAruE5uAIQNA~This cafe, recently bought over from an Italian (no surprises here!) has the most tempting counter of food! Situated on Elm Row, I would personally rather grab a bite here to go, or eat at home, as it is quite small but the quality of the food can't be questioned!  The staff were extremely friendly, and a woman who worked there assured me there'd be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered! I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe, as the food changes quite often and doesn't start to bore the customers.  They've got a clever lay out, as they offer ciabatas, baked potatoes, baguettes, wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter! The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good, and to top it off, they are quite cheap as well.~potatoes, wraps baked potato ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~nWlWipBs0dqxjmmbreA34A~The place was empty, but the staff(owners?) did not seem happy to see customers when the 5 of us walked in. They had trouble understanding English and didn't seem to remember what the ingredients were and kept referencing the menu while making our paninis. My chicken panini was all bread with almost no chicken except a few paper thin scraps. I think maybe they were getting ready to close and didn't want to cook anymore so they gave me what was left.~chicken chicken ~2
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~YLPeCurImh1t-2m9bCe92A~Good place to grab a bite.  A colleague raved about their baked potatoe which I tried and was positively stuffed!  Had a Mexican wrap today, which came with salad and coleslaw.  Tasted great, would recommend as also have prompt service.~salad coleslaw. ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~aEWnHeQdn7iEZMCoa7WCHA~I found this lovely little café on route to a yoga class on a sunny Saturday morning, desperate for some caffeine and a minimal breakfast which would complain if I spent lots of time bending over and touching my toes!   Elm Row Café and Diner is filled with personality, every wall covered with interesting things. There is a well stacked bookshelf in the corner by the counter, and a world map on the wall by the door with a request to 'pin where you've travelled'. It has a few tables but still feels small enough to be comfy in you are there on your own.   I struggled to make my mind up but ended up with an Americano and some yoghurt coated raisins which were very satisfactory. The menu was vast though, featuring a variety of hot and cold snacks, and even Turkish coffee!~coffee! ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~mNaJF8VoaRH_0oZsvUrHjw~A good place for a lunch bite.  They have a few small tables and plenty of sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from.  I liked the buffalo chicken wraps, the falafel and the soups.    I found myself going back there a few times when I was staying in Edinburgh recently because the owners were friendly and the food was very good and freshly made.~sandwiches, salads chicken wraps, ~4
7hQBdTPEiE-9VegOC7FvEw~V4-ZX5aWtubdXGQ6giS16g~I stopped here to meet a friend for a quick coffee and cake session, and I was surprised to see it because I have passed the place loads of times and just never noticed it.  This is a wee traditional caff, selling lunch food like paninis, toasties and a selection of hot meals. The cakes were superb- my scone with jam and cream was divine coupled with a cup of milky tea- heaven or what?  It was a cute and comfortable place to sit, and even though it was small we never felt rushed to leave. It was pretty inexpensive too, and I would most definitely come back for something more substantial.~coffee cake ~5
5EMj3yDUbrD0wsCDRi81bA~LmN5liJprppg3hVsyjpJ_Q~Took my Spanish boyfriend to Inverness for the day. Went to this pub and had Bombay slimline. Asked the barman for lime or lemon they did'nt have any and he wasn't polite. My boyfriend ordered the food and when it arrived my order was wrong. Told the waiter, he went to bar to get reciept to prove that it was ordered wrong and was argumentative with no apology whatsoever abd insited we pay for original order and wrong order. Terrible attitude and service will never go again~lime lemon ~1
5_PnFZnl1xSoCQq0qytC2w~52xW3hDevHUofyVPr6FICA~This is the closest Tim Horton near my house and I have been going there for the past 5 years. The food is the usual fast food but I always go since it's close and the service were good.  However, it all changed when they changed the manager from the older male manager to a new small female asian manager. The old manager is very patient and very chatty and friendly but this new manager is very impatient and rude to customers.   I was there to order the new grilled bagel and she at first mistaken that I wanted a bagel. When I cleared it up so that she has to make a modification on the order, everyone can hear her muttering "oh god...". Then I specifically asked for a combo and when she gave me the food, there is no hush brown. When I ask her about it, she just said annoyingly that she did not charge me and walked away.  As a client, I can accept mistakes in the order as long as everything is clarified, either make the order right and charge me for the difference or apologize and let me know there isn't much she can do about it. However, her behavior is not setting a good example to the other employees and I sincerely hope that they change the manager for this store.~brown. ~1
5_PnFZnl1xSoCQq0qytC2w~Q4yOnlHKBgQVrd8RTeZf7A~Terrible service! Muffins were stale and they would not return my money. The French fries were the worst I have ever eaten. They also let children run around and play and yell.  Coffee is good and hot though. I will go back to TH, just not this one.~french fries ~1
4JO5H2W1PpO9iomUyVzgpQ~ud2l9anklsjUGVX-vbU0rw~Ah! Les restos à déjeuner!  On se demande toujours pourquoi les gens aiment faire la ligne le samedi matin à seule fin de se faire servir des oeufs-bacon, avec une tranche de melon et deux rondelles de banane...    À la base, donc, on ne peut pas dire que je suis fan de ce genre d'endroit... Néanmoins, si on devait éliminer 90% de ce genre de restaurant, je pense que je voudrait que la grand-mère poule demeure.  Pourquoi ?  D'abord parce qu'il y a au moins moyen, chez eux, de manger autre chose que les éternels oeufs-crêpe-pain dorés.  J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit.  Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine.  Les portions sont généreuses et les prix très convenables.  Pourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?  Parce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire).  Évitez tout ce qui ressemble à un expresso, cappucino, café au lait  en cet endroit (en tous cas, si vous aimez le café).  À titre d'exemple, quand j'ai commandé un expresso double très très court, on m'a apporté une bonne demi-tasse d'eau de vaisselle.  On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire...  Merde, c'est au moins 8 fois trop d'eau!  Changez de machine! Leur filtre, quoique manquant un peu de concentration, est bon à sa façon.  Vaut mieux s'en tenir à ça...  Mais tout de même, pour un resto à déjeuner, ne pas pouvoir faire un café décent...~bacon, bacon, pancakes ~3
4JO5H2W1PpO9iomUyVzgpQ~Q2A0_5cG_5xerGdRPDNgsQ~A very good place for brunch. They have a lot a choices and it's inexpensive. The place is very cute and decorated like a farm. I had eggs florentine on english muffins and smoked salmon with a hollandaise sauce. It comes with hash-brown potatoes and sweet & warm apples. The bill was less than $12.~smoked salmon ~4

6SxrnI0BKc7bVj7Vcuu7Vw~Hpc5lHI15F9432VUFCwNyQ~This is one of the worst Tim Horton's I have ever been to. Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right. Almost half the time I go there they either give me the wrong item. Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea. Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else for whatever it was you wanted.~coffee tea. ~1
6Q2DOgrudAtGtzaCPmCw2g~pKKL1mAJmO01at9vPqNFFg~Lovely vegetarian cafe that serves good big portions of wholesome meals. If you can't decide what to have at the counter, you can pick and mix, having 2 half portions of main courses for instance, or a main course and a couple of salads. There is a noticeboard, and often artists exhibit on the walls.~salads. ~5
6Q2DOgrudAtGtzaCPmCw2g~xes7Y_TbpiDK3zAskv0vjg~Susie's Diner is somewhere to go when you've indulged beyond the pale and your body is suffering physical guilt and demanding some healthy comfort. Generous portions of delicious vegetarian fare are the order of the day. They have a system where you can choose various configurations of salads, quiches and hot dishes for set prices in a canteen-esque set up. Prices are generally around £3-£7.    The mix 'n' match crockery together with the self-service food and drink give Susie's a very informal feeling and the casual décor of red painted walls, unvarnished tables and wooden benches all contribute to the sense of being at the village refectory.    Feel-good food in a family friendly diner devoid of any pretension. Lovely.~salads, ~4
6Q2DOgrudAtGtzaCPmCw2g~iH8HPB1tvVIAuTDZTiNWTA~Located conveniently near george Square campus, this small albeit popular restaurant/cafe has a winning combination of great food, generous portions, good service and reasonable price ( also as a bonus, the 'guilt free' satisfaction of having eaten a vegetarian and organic meal). Desserts and cakes are to die for! The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is all smiles and you can linger over a meal and a conversation with a friend.~desserts ~5
6Q2DOgrudAtGtzaCPmCw2g~gPQGi1IUKhO3lfR0k7ZxmQ~I was disappointed with Susie's diner. For 4.20pounds I got a small plate with one portion of hot food and some rice. No salad or anything. The service was also rude and abrupt; there is absolutely no excuse for rolling of the eyes and tutting when a customer doesn't have the correct change. I will say that the food was delicious (I made my small portion last as long as possible) but next time I would go to the mosque kitchen next door and get a much larger meal for less without the dramatic service.~salad ~1
09Hl38pDGEe1uSBNiqLKzg~bM32DVNNGQf5LnkMK32KJg~I'm really surprised about the crappy ratings this place has been given!!!  Went tonight with my husband. Their homemade guacamole was amazing. I had the baked tortillas with goat cheese and shrimp, extremely tasty!  The service was friend, informative and really fast. The food was prepared quickly and well presented. Try the lime margaritas!  We will be going back soon!~tortillas cheese shrimp, lime ~5
09Hl38pDGEe1uSBNiqLKzg~C0_-bH9bHSRgSOSOgvU5nA~Courteous service but the food is terrible. I ordered the burrito which was cold and came with no noticeable cheese. Beef stuffing was dry and the only flavour I tasted was salt. Will not go again.~burrito cheese. beef ~1
09Hl38pDGEe1uSBNiqLKzg~VLTgcjWrZW_uE16Rp0C6_Q~Strong points:  - Very tasty, simple food; - Reasonably priced, especially given the location; - Friendly, fast service.  Weak points:  - No vegetarian option for main dishes. Vegetarian entrées were available and I was told that the burrito's meat/chicken could be swapped for grilled vegetables at the same price. Weak. Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes. - The booze situation. Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear). The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu. When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available. I understand that restaurants need to sell alcohol to increase the average check price, but the power sell was a bit too much for me and it really turned me off.  Solid three stars.~burrito cheese ~3
09Hl38pDGEe1uSBNiqLKzg~EncZUhbUmul19NDFIaalrw~Good service, horrible food!  It came cold, and when i complained my food was cold (fridge cold) i was told its normal in a busy restaurant to cook all the food early in the morning and then reheat it for service. I respectfully declined that dish and paid for our appetizers and walked away.~appetizers ~1
7Km9UXolK9vEeBDNqTl5DA~zS4NOnaspKLpV0Sd2Q6UOg~I realize how pretentious it is to review an airport Quiznos. However, this $9 salad I just gave up on is particularly bad. Most of the ingredients are literally frozen. The tomatoes also taste like rancid little iced cubes. Gross. Will not return.~salad ~1
7Km9UXolK9vEeBDNqTl5DA~0gvjMDGIjGitQy4uz8Hi7w~This was the worst/most expensive sandwich i ever had in my life.  I paid $9 for a steak sandwich that had no steak. One paper thin slice of meat on one half of the foot long sub was all i got and everything is supposedly prepared ahead of time so they wont/cant fix it.  And the actual bread was salty ...way too salty. and the sauce that came with it tastes like it was rancid.  The whole thing was inedible.  WORST ever. Dont waste your money.~sandwich steak sandwich ~1
7A00Z3xfN7gjp4RcOeWdfQ~u0vm2xRKmzgdjJQGWuol6w~APD has been great to me! They have shown their passion for paintball and for their customers by the way they treat others! They always take care of my needs and come through when I am needing guidance with my journey as a professional player! Matt is extremely awesome. He's honest and he knows that paintball is a expensive sport but he always seems to be fair. Everyone should make this their go-to store and cherish the good paintball fellowship that it holds.~sport ~5
7A00Z3xfN7gjp4RcOeWdfQ~xRGmDZfXF8s8hSnR3072Nw~I think this is one of the best places to go for everything paintball, and even airsoft! I airsoft myself, and bought an airsoft gun from here.  They have all the best paintball and airsoft guns here. The best quality guns for people who are a bit more serious about the sport. This isn't your cheap Wal-Mart guns here. The employees are also great, and extremely helpful. They will answer any question, and even help you out if you are new at the sport.   For the best in gear and supplies for Paintball & Airsoft go here!~sport. sport. ~5
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~S1nm6C3BBgLbIxWc9ChMiQ~Average. I ordered the sandwich with lamb sandwich combo with salad and a soda.  The sandwich is blunt. The portion of salad is generous. I can't finish the sandwich so I tried to pick the meat out of the bread and I found a suspicious hair probably a eyelash.  The worst part was that the owner wouldn't give us the receipt and charged five dollar more than what we should pay. I even asked did he include the tips in the bill. After he ""realized" he charged more. He said he thought we order one more soda. What soda worth 5 dollars? That's totally a lie. He is not a honest man and he acted like it was our fault not telling him we took only two soda. I wouldn't go there again.~sandwich lamb sandwich salad sandwich salad sandwich ~2
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~TRUD23wv1wcTq2rzYCrgfg~Ehhhhh yani ! When you can't find authentic Turkish food it's like you have no choice but to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent, but unfortunately you can't eat anything good here . First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be but unfortunately it does not work that way , Now is the restaurant busy ? Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is .  People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec . Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :)))))  Is the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good,  Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?  Because who wants to invest in Montreal ? They rather go to Toronto Vancouver etc where they don't have to put up with tax or French bs.  Thank you for reading my review~salad , salad ~2
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~BPmxbWMie6Ium_HViV8u4A~Came all the way to NDG for some authentic Turkish kebobs. I had the mixed meat plate, which consisted of chicken, lamb and meatball kebab and some salads on the side. Let me just say, the portions are HUGE. One plate was plenty for two people. I couldn't even finish half of it and gave the rest to my boyfriend who was more than happy to devour it for himself. all in all, the kebabs are alright, not bad for turkish/middle eastern kebabs, but not quite worth coming all the way to NDG for either.    The price was reasonable, around $14 for the large plate, which can be shared generously among two people.~chicken, lamb salads ~3
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~KvSXexxSO3a2cesoir_Vjw~This place is nothing BUT express. Waited 20 minutes for two Chicken Kebab Sandwich for take out, and I was the only customer during dinner service.  The sandwich was extremely bland, with barely any seasoning, or lack thereof.  One more thing, the guy who was preparing my sandwich did not wash the lettuce I saw him chopped and he did not wash his hands after handling raw meat either.  I won't go as far as recommending McDonald's instead of this place, but Subway is definitely a wiser choice.~chicken sandwich sandwich sandwich lettuce ~1
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~mjUlssopynZq52i6SXv8Qw~My friend was raving about this, saying it's as good as Antep (as if)  I took the mixed plate, very little meat and was still hungry. Close to $20 with a can of coke. No rice, just some salad and a bulgur type of side. Bread was good, but meat felt re-heated.  It's only ok if you've had your fill of Shish-Taouk in the city and are in the mood to try something else~coke. salad ~2
7wD1o1dIxUPmquqpNHFFWw~cuoyUonvQkCBbA-bJRwsDg~Turkish style Sandwich Restaurant. Went twice, the first and the last.  If it wasn't for the amount of time you must wait until your friggin sandwich gets prepared (between 20-25 minutes!) this place may have a modicum of chance with the other dozen or so Middle Eastern sandwich places around the corner. And believe me it is not a busy restaurant. Although one can quip about their mediocre decor or lack thereof, I can only talk positive about the bread they use which is ok, not too fluffy and slightly crispy after it's grilled. Otherwise their other ingredients suck and the sandwich has no real flavour.   Oh and they change their menu prices quite often and I once got charged the older higher price when it was time to pay. Not cool!  :((~sandwich sandwich sandwich sandwich ~2
-SlPWO0rh7mOUtAWodN0lQ~HsEmefIJoZsBr0AAFcKQIw~Picture your favourite winter socks. Are you doing it? Are they woolen and heather gray with red stripes around the top? Of course they are! Old Faithful Shop carries your old faithful favourites, and completely deserves it's adorable name.   This store is a pleasure to be in. Very minimal and calming, yet filled with lots of great household brands. Blankets, coffee extras, soaps and sleek extras make up the inventory, and I dig it.~coffee ~4
-SlPWO0rh7mOUtAWodN0lQ~TP05RCB4yTadjKunxdL24g~Is this place Brand New?!  Grand Opening Sunday March 8, 2015!   Old Faithful Shop's simple storefront made me stop and want to shop!   Imports from the West Coast: Jacobsen, Stumptown, Blackbird from Portland my favorite city!     A good supply of Coffee making equipment Chemex and Hario.  OFS is originally from Vancouver.~coffee ~4
-SlPWO0rh7mOUtAWodN0lQ~MM26qDkjiQnggE7AsXFA4g~Want that expensive rope dog leash and I don't even have a dog. Want that $20 old key can opener. There are things in here I didn't know I needed and then I realize I must have Made in Canada socks. I must have a marble tray. I must have another coffee Chemex pot. I must have... Some explaining to do when I get home.   And, look at that kerning in their logo, though. It's emblematic of how much space is between each item for sale in the store. Respect that move, and respect a store that'll go for broke and carry both expensive ropes and Oregonian sea salts.~coffee ~5
8BGaeORHKZT8AJ3sUSXZcA~zQ5X-uikoGh9XLPvtmveyQ~This guy came over to my house on Saturday to trim my 2 schnauzers.  I thought the first one looked good but when I got close, I could see that the grooming was uneven.  On my 2 schnauzer...poor dog.  A small white femail schnauzer.  He took off all of her hair and you can see pink skin.  He shaved her so close that she has razor burn and rash by her vagina and her anus.  She keeps licking it and she's shaking.  I'm worried that it will get infected and I will have to take her to the vet.  Going to PetsMart to see what they recommend.  I will be welcome to send you a pic of her razor burn to show you.  jk14me@aol.com~white ~1
4CtO9NSXi9MCgYsPZBdN8w~ta7-y-WuMBMGBexdHbZroA~** 3.5 Stars **  My love for cooking and food often drives me to search out the best wares and items to create that perfect dish.  When Williams Sonoma came to Canada, I was thrilled but the price mark up kept me away from the store for the first few years.  Fast forward to today and I'm still weary of paying the Canadian retail price but the service and noted constant sales is slowly winning me over.  The store is right at the corridor leading to Holt Renfrew and right across from Tiffany's.  With it's golden accented and deep blonde wood doors, the waft of spiced apple cider pulls me in.  They have a full working kitchen inside the store and one of their cleaver ploys is having a constant baked or bubbling item going at all times.  During Thanksgiving it's their pumpkin butter bars and now it's their peppermint bark and spiced cider.    For the epicurean, this place is potentially nirvana (if it was all free).  You'll find only the best (and most expensive) pieces to adorn your kitchen and dining room.  Heavy copper pots, high end espresso machines, singular grain Japanese knives, hard to find herbs and spices, bakeware, and china fills the room in all corners.  The associates free float and are super helpful to find the perfect utensil or item of your kitchen dreams.    They have many high end brands like Le Creuset, All Clad,  WMF, and Kikuichi. It can be really daunting at first to pick up one item and see it being $300+.  The nice thing is that there are some (relatively) affordable alternatives nearby and the associates are more than happy to explain which one would be best for you.  If you're lucky, you may find one of those ridiculously high end items in their clearance section at a good 50% off. I managed to pick an All Clad saucier that way and I still love it do date.  The store is open, spacious, and well stocked.  There is never an issue with service as they are so efficient in finding you a brand new boxed item and running it through the cashier till in minutes.  Though it is a very expensive store, the quality of the items and service does make it feel special.  Now... if they stop that horrid Canadian mark up, this would be a perfect 4 star store.~apple pumpkin butter date. ~3
1PtbYPmwrPD0ouzkE8a2JQ~J0Iu0UOAHJd0sdUjicalJA~Olive oils from different parts of the world, some as far away as Australia, all processed in California. The oils are all in large metal barrels and you can ask for FREE tastings, before deciding which  oil you like/wish to purchase. There are various fleur de sels and peppercorns as well as balsamic vinegars and pricey pastas. The goods ain't cheap, but this is all supposed to be "gourmet" and  high quality, hence the high prices. The locale is well -situated, in the Jean Talon Market  area,large, airy, and well-lit. The staff is friendly and California laid back, will only "help" you if you ask . Another foodie address to remember and keep.~olive ~5
1PtbYPmwrPD0ouzkE8a2JQ~8vVMVTTH4zSFwJxikceXPg~Ah le plaisir des huiles d'olives. Si bonnes, si belles...! Quand ma mère m'a parlé d'Olio et Cie, j'ai été rapidement tentée d'y aller et maman, comme bonne maman qu'elle est, m'a traînée tout de suite avec elle pour que je l'accompagne.   Tout d'abord, quand on rentre, c'est comme un havre de paix. Puis après, il y a cette tentation d'essayer toutes les huiles d'olives qui sont en expo. J'ai pas attendu qu'on me sert, je me suis moi-même servie dans les vinaigres balsamiques blanc et j'ai goûté tout ce qui m'avait l'air appétissant. J'ai trouvé un délicieux vinaigre balsamique à la vanille et j'ai été tentée de le ramener chez moi tout de suite pour le manger avec tous mes desserts : glace au chocolat, fruits frais, petites baies....   Leurs huiles d'olives sont divines. Saviez-vous qu'une huile d'olive corsée se rapproche en terme de sensation au raifort un peu? Ça sort un peu par le nez, juste un peu et c'est très chaud, très intense comme saveur. J'ai vraiment trop aimé. L'intensité rend l'expérience délicieuse!  Seul hic : je suis une étudiante et c'est un peu pricey. Ceci dit, il est sûr que je vais y retourner me chercher mon huile parfaite pour mes salades. :)~desserts : ~4
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~MlLX9Yu_nBuXwwaCS9Yxgg~Dropped by for all you can eat (AYCE) lunch. For $12.99, it wasn't bad. Now for that price, don't order any raw fish dishes. It won't be 'jumped out of the water' fresh.  The soups were good - a bit starchy but the hot and sour tasted fine.   Thai mango salad - skip. The mango was nice but the sauce was awkward. Kind of like that teenager that hopes to be cool but can't figure out what style they are going for - grunge? Hipster? Goth? I would say "traditional" is best 4/5 times.  I would highly recommend the teriaki chicken. I found their grilled dishes to be piping hot and crisp. I also enjoyed the inari and unami - not huge pieces but they were good...  I'd go back. The service was quite attentive but you had better keep track of what you ordered. They often forgot your dishes or lost track of them. Hence why I can't comment on the dim sum, it never arrived!~thai mango salad - mango chicken. ~3
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~uH2YZGbBjnL7fh18hSTTFA~Lovely restaurant and lots of great options to choose from. The servers were great and the atmosphere was lovely. Drinks are reasonably priced, too.  The sushi was okay- not top bar but not too bad. It was atleast good enough that I want to come back and try one if their main courses!  It's always empty because people don't know yet what this place has to offer.~sushi ~4
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~a1L8PZ8RFl2KlRCoFgdFIQ~Updated: They've removed the all you can eat...not worth it now!   For all you can eat this is very good! 11.99 for lunch and it's all you can eat sushi, thai, Chinese and some Dim Sum. For the sushi I would recommend the fiery dragon which is dragon roll with a nice sauce on top. Thai pad thai and hot and spicy chicken are nice too. The mango salad and the dim sum were only ok.   It's not gourmet but for the price it's DEF worth it!~sushi, thai, sushi thai thai chicken mango salad ~1
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~YeG48J-j63W6GXzzzS1Rgw~12.99 for lunch AYCE. extra $1 for soft drinks with free refills (good deal)! The food wasn't bad, but the chicken wasn't fresh, there was a weird taste to it. Sushi rolls were surprising good. Service was bad though. Solo diners get ignored. That I can deal with since I have been to a lot of Asian restaurants in the past with no service. But this was worse because the manager was actually quite rude. And I got the impression that he is trying to control how much you order. I might stay away until service improves. TIP: SKIP the dim sum and go for the sushi instead.~chicken sushi sushi ~3
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~ScSSqnqUcErq2yL_TWZ_WA~Tried for the first time with a friend. This location has been under renovations or construction for a while, and it hasn't really picked up speed, so it's easy to pass it by. That and it's name doesn't seem that prominent, I thought Hot and Spicy was the description. Oh well.  First impressions; it looks pretty fancy inside, kinda shiny, and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order. I almost felt like I didn't belong. But they were quite friendly, I guess they should be since it was only us and one or 2 people getting take out. My friend got the mango chicken, and I ordered a lunch special of grilled teriyaki salmon.   The special was great, it came with a really good hot and sour soup, some dark organic rice and your typical kind of salad. The salmon was very good. The mango chicken was good but it wasn't a hit. And it costed about $5 more since it wasn't a special..  I think overall the regular menu is a little pricey for me compared to other things nearby. I would come back for the special if I come back, since it was quite good and better value than what else was on the menu. And the service was a-ok.  I think this place needs some more chances!~mango chicken, salmon. soup, salad. salmon mango chicken ~3
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~9Nm7PUpcpZq5JGGkacwI6Q~Just came back from the AYCE Lunch & gonna write & rate as I can still remember it:  Miso Soup (3.5 Stars) Hot & Sour Soup (3 Stars) Thai Mango Salad (3 Stars - couldn't tell if the dressing had Fish Sauce in it) Satay Beef - WOULD NOT order again, too chewy Satay Chicken (4.5 Stars - *REALLY GOOD!*) California Roll (3.5 Stars) Dynamite Roll (3.5 Stars) Spicy Salmon (4 Stars) House Fried Rice (3.5 Stars) Thai Basil Eggplant (3.5 Stars) Fried Tofu - WOULD NOT order this again.  Was under the impression this was cubes of tofu with the fried tofu skin, but it turned out to be tofu wrapped in won ton wrappers & deep fried Har Gow (3 Stars) Siu Mai (3 Stars)  PROS: - We were able to get a seat when we arrived at 1:15 pm, but the place got pretty packed shortly after.  - $1.00 Bottomless pop soooo good, not watered down at all. - The place is done up all fancy-like.  Nice atmosphere to sit in. - Service was quick & *SUPER* friendly  CONS: - No dessert on the AYCE menu.   - Dim sum items weren't that great - its like they needed more salt.  Kind of bland.  NEUTRAL/OTHER OBSERVATIONS: - Didn't have the wonton soup when I ordered it, so I went for Hot & Sour instead. - The food here is kind of like Manchu Wok/Szechuan-Szechuan type food, with the addition of Sushi though   - Even though it says on the menu they will charge $2.00 for each item not consumed, they didn't charge us, even though we had about 3 half-dishes of uneaten items left. - If sitting by the windows facing Queen St., you don't wanna be facing west cause the sun will be shining in your face.  =S  - I would go back for sure.  =)  The food could use some work though.~miso soup ( soup ( thai mango salad ( beef - chicken ( california roll ( salmon ( fried rice ( thai tofu - tofu tofu tofu wonton soup ~3

There are better choices in the neighbourhood.  They were slow taking my order, 10 minutes later another waiter brought me another menu.  They missed bringing out my appetizer. Kung Pow Chicken was ok and then it took some effort to get my bill.~chicken ~2
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~zb8qxdE_iqr5KCtSqu97Jg~Came here for dinner with my family and had a very poor experience. The restaurant was empty so we were excited to have dedicated service.   Pros (although not many):  1. Decor is modern and appears fairly clean.   Cons:  1. Very slow and incompetent service, despite being one of the only families at the restaurant. They kept getting our order wrong and bringing out duplicate dishes. An hour in to dinner we still did not receive our sushi and had to place our order again  2. "Cooked" dim sum dishes coming to the table raw  Would not come back and would not recommend.~sushi ~1
4SfADHMfFDiiXesW84-v6Q~1PZd2mQuQlCaOzG3AxWcFg~Been at this spot a few times so I wanted to give it a few takes prior to giving it a fair review.  The food is very bland!  Any request for spicy food results in them tossing in chili flakes.  At Salad King they use fresh peppers!  When I was in Thailand, they use fresh peppers.  The peppers should be infused in the meal!!!  Service?  I have only gone through take out, 3 times.  My last experience was super bad.  I had to go back and forth from my office to the restaurant since they messed up my order twice.  THREE trips to that location for 1 order is unacceptable.    The manager I met a few weeks back is super friendly!  I wish he was there to address that issue.  Best of luck to this new restaurant!  Hope they do well in the end!~salad ~1

This place felt like a tourist trap. Dinner is not all you can eat, but ala carte.  Besides the green tea, nothing was ok. Hot and sour soup was commercial and average (probably better than anything else we ate). Chicken in black bean sauce was so bland and bad (even though we asked for spicy). Fried rice was meh. Sui mai and har gow were glutinous and barely had flavour. Very sorry to have spent any money here at all. Just looks clean and neat and spacious. That's all. Walk a few extra steps to Queen Mother or even Ginger. Or Trimurti Indian food across the road. Don't get trapped here.~tea, soup chicken black bean sauce fried rice ginger. ~2

-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~LzSa9K9JD3JxlToygKvIYQ~I remember Country Kitchen when I was a young boy living in Minnesota.  The restaurants were a lot fewer back then so going out to eat was a big deal.  My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why...  If the food was as bland back then as it is now, it is completely forget-able.    I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra...)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc.  It will do in a pinch, but I have yet to be really wowed and I am pretty sure I will not be.  Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go.  The area of the restaurant and indeed the area where I live is plagued by the economy.  We are a neighborhood of the haves and the have-nots.  When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people.  But I digress...back to the Country Kitchen.  It is a bit pricey for what you get but there are lots of coupons out there including some from their own web site.  So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food.  Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food.  On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment.  So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben.  : )  Enjoy!~sandwich ~2
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~FREza9bdzk73F9moTNmK4Q~We get takeout from CK every month or so, and it's pretty solid 'American' food.  The menu has a bit of variety, but you're not likely to find anything too wild or exciting on it.  At the same time, if you are looking for 'wild and exciting' at a place called Country Kitchen, you're probably going to be disappointed no matter what.  I almost gave them 4 stars based on their seasonal breadbowl soups...try the pot roast soup, that was our favorite.~soup, ~3
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~_7TC__F2voaH4o_9Oybp9g~Southern hospitality? Yes ma'am (or Mister)  :)  The first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent.  My daughter looked at me & asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent,,,, I went with no. I'm not sure where it's from, but it's a 'honey & y'all' accent :D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure. She made her mama proud.   The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day. I love having breakfast for dinner, so that's a big selling point to me :)  The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean.   In all honesty I would have given them an A OK rating, 3 stars, but our server pushed them to a 'yay! I'm a fan', 4 star rating.  Good people make the difference!~honey & ~4
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~DcQ6X-rMsnnRNNOEczPR9g~I've been eating at this CK since they opened ... I think back in 2008. I probably go once or twice a month for breakfast, and occasionally for lunch / dinner. I can say that their management in the past has SUCKED. They've changed managers several times, and can never seem to get a good one. I have no met the current one, I just noticed that the last one I met is no longer there.  The waitresses are usually great. There have only been a couple that have been disappointing, and I haven't seen them around in quite a while.  The breakfast food is pretty standard. Pancakes, waffles, omelets, and all the usual breakfast meats.  Their burgers are decent, but I don't care for any of their other lunch items. Their all you can eat rib or fish & chips nights are a pretty good deal, but I'm not really impressed by their dinner food. However, I've never had anything that wasn't good enough for me to eat till I'm full.~pancakes, burgers chips ~4
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~i1oOi1uf7nKBYvAXRYswHA~As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had! I would much rather come here than IHOP~french fries ~4
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~PyBoxmp1i_ve8y4HFY0SHA~Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say "Surprise you can do better" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad, but nothing special. we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat,   the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.  so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships,   the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the "campy wall crap" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.  unfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes.  I was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same.~pancakes appetizers beef fries, white pancakes. ~2
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~Y7fIn6BIQdgZnSj-5WnHlw~This was a great place to stop and eat breakfast.  I enjoyed the fact that we were seated quickly and that they had the games on the TV.  It felt like I was at home eating breakfast.  Real cozy, which is something I don't feel at Denny's or Norm's.  The menu had many options and they all looked good.  I was in the mood for something with cheese and eggs, but not an omelet, so I ordered the Skillet Scramble with a side of toast... it was freaken good!  Taste was great and the portion size was plenty (I did not finish it).  I was out there in AZ hanging with friends for the weekend and glad we made a stop there for breakfast.~cheese ~4
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~ZCjZBNvyD6NqxjUH6wX2ZQ~Overpriced and boring.  There is nothing overly creative or unique about any of their menu offerings.  Very limited menu, especially for healthier or vegetarian options.  Don't be fooled by their claim to "the best pancakes in town".  They were doughy and not all that spectacular.  I would be surprised if this place was able to make it another 6 months, but according to their website, 5 new Country Kitchen franchises are due to open in the Phoenix area.  Good luck with that one!  Places like Denny's, Village Inn, and IHOP do a better job for less money and have brand recognition to boot.~pancakes ~1
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~acbHVSfioxCgLoGcNzZxDw~My wife and I have been to the Country Kitchen twice now and we have really enjoyed it. The servers we have had have been outstanding. Very attentive and friendly.   On to the food. On my first visit I had the blue cheese burger with fries. the Burger was very juicy and tender topped with a good quality blue cheese. The fries were crispy and you could actually taste potato, not salt and grease.   On our second trip my wife and I started with the loaded potato skins with a side of ranch. We didn't even have to ask for the ranch. The server brought it out because we had asked to have a side of it with our burger to dip there oh so yummy onion rings in. :) The potato skins had to be some of the best we have had. they were piled with there four cheese blend and crisp bacon. Fresh. and tasty.   My wife and I split the big BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and it did not disappoint. The brought it out already cut and on two separate plates with an equal amount of onion rings on each. The burger was juicy and the BBQ sauce did not over power the beef. The service was stellar and the food was good.   PS. you get 20% off with a movie ticket either before or after the show. So stop on in and enjoy great service and good food.~cheese burger ~4
-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg~fkgwHqj83cYR39g-6SRWHw~This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill. I think two is the limit.  I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak. I think he watches too much CSI and should stop interrogating the customers. Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order.~coffee brown steak. ~2
GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg~2PvdfdcaXLLr8N9aX0TE6A~Wow, did they ever fix First Fridays. I had almost given up due to the distances, the crowds, getting pushed off the sidewalk by goth kids with glowsticks and cloves.  Now it's so much better!  I mean you still get to say "look at that effin hipster" every five seconds, but now you are doing it from a nice, safe and blocked off Roosevelt.  Everything is accessible, no more scary walks down by vacant lots to get to the next grouping.  I got see Imperial Storm Troopers (I bet they were sweating up a storm!) 2 of the 4 Ghostbusters, the Sisters of Mercy and a guy in a pink fuzzy suit (possibly a teletubby?) who gave me a totally free hug!  Took the light rail down, had a nice dinner, walked off part of the pasta, checked out some art and had a great time people watching.   The decision to consolidate the First Fridays area was a stellar one, and I will be back for sure now - I just may wait until it cools off again.~pasta, ~5
GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg~mN55sakkOn0i7dWCwS5-Iw~What a great concept!  A few artist friends have been trying to lure me into checking out  First Friday around Roosevelt for years now.  "You will love it!", they exclaimed.  It didn't exactly grab me as a place to take a baby to...whole bunch of crazy partying artists for an excuse...just kidding.  I finally went along with my hubby and 5 year old son about 5 months ago for the first time and have gone to several since then.  We absolutely loved it!  We parked around Tammie Coe's Bakery (that's how we came to visit this joint so often) and order some coffee and dessert while we walked around.  Artlink definitely revived what was once a seedy part of downtown into something so unique to Phoenicians.  Old and dilapidated bungalows were transformed into jewelry, pottery, and sculpture enclaves.  Headlining local bands performing in front yards...so cool!  It's brilliant to take a small apartment complex in a state of disrepair into single room artist galleries.  My son was mesmerized by a couple of beautiful women with their flame throwing act while a bonfire ablazed behind them.  That's the only time he stood still.    I told my artist friends how much I enjoy First Fridays. They told me "It's not the same as it used to be.  It's so crowded now when it was once just a whole bunch of artists getting together."  I'm glad I waited...~coffee ~5
GEVK0qDkoCSF2oTaHv9nJg~t7uAM_PPBRpcFCheTmhFZg~I went to April's First Friday this year not knowing what to expect. Downtown was so much more crowded than I imagined it would be. I had no idea where to park since I wasn't sure what I even wanted to do other than eat at the food trucks which are located between 3rd and 5th street on Roosevelt. I ended up parking in the Phoenix Public Market lot. I got there around 8pm and luckily found a spot. Walking the streets (no, I'm not a hooker) was a bit overwhelming. There was a mix of people on the streets, but I will say that I felt like I stood out like a sore thumb.. I guess I'm on the preppy side. Popular trends were skinny jeans, cloves and bohemian folk. We basically just walked where there was crowds because there was something to see everywhere. There is so much going on with street performers, art/jewelry sellers, art galleries, that I don't feel like I even came close to fully experiencing First Friday. I was happy that I got to try some food truck goodies (bacon ice cream from Sweet Republic; banana rumballs, stuffed jalapenos, bombay fries w cucumber dipping sauce from Sunshine & Spice; portabella tacos from Carte Blanc). I'm looking forward to checking out First Friday again.. so four stars since it reeled me in! I now know to expect there to be a lot of people and some rowdiness, but lots of cops patrolling and monitoring the crowds.~bacon ice cream banana fries cucumber tacos ~4
2Ka-a7ayZy6fcxqdTxmyhA~PtdUS7ufw6M80mQExeye_g~This location is clean and the cashiers are nice. They offer "Rebel Rewards" and that gives you discounts on gas and other things. They also offer the ringed doughnuts 2 for a $1.  I don't usually get gas at this Rebel it is usually a stop for coffee, fountain drinks, and snacks, but the gas pumps are usually full. I see on the sign that they give a discount for paying with cash.  Rebel has one of the best Vanilla Frappucinno in town too! As far as gas stations go of course!~doughnuts coffee, ~4
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~dwwQz222EmcDSxIiEPuk-A~If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there.  Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful. There weren't any standouts among the dishes- most everything was pretty generic. My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom... somehow, we were able to time our vomiting. In retrospect, it's kinda impressive.  I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature. As others mentioned, the chef spent a lot of time checking on the dishes, but he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid.   The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss.~sushi, ~1
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~6M8_YeqymYxIPfn2O3j4rg~I've been going here steadily for the last 10 years and it's by far the best chinese buffet in the valley. They've got tons of fresh sushi and any kind of food you want. The spicy chicken and sweet shrimp are my favorites. The place has been completely overhauled as of the last  months and it's never looked better. The owners are always on site, and if you want a specific kind of roll/sashimi/nigiri  they're very happy to accomodate you.~sushi chicken shrimp ~5
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~ASFRBOHtzXP5Z3GJAuOOlA~Yea I know most buffet's are ronchy, the food is actually pretty good here. They have fresh sushi, crab legs, and plenty of shrimp. The bathroom stinks, but the food is good.~sushi, shrimp. ~3
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~_AwO47GzxalScySj-eZF1g~I have been wanting to have Americanized Chinese for a week or so. After driving up 7th St. I stopped at this place. The place had faint wet-rag sort of smell to it, but it could have been that our booth seats were wiped with a wet rag right before as the seats were still glistening with water.   The food is what it is and what you would expect, Nothing spectacular. They have the orange chicken, beef broccoli, spring rolls, and all those type of dishes, however not as assembly line and generic tasting as the Panda Express chains. One of the chicken dishes had chicken that tasted like the chicken was old or left out too long.    The bill for two of us dining including drinks(iced tea)was under $22.00 not including tip. Definitely cheap, however not worth more.   The bottom line is if you are looking for a Americanized Chinese for cheap, then you have found the place.~orange chicken ~2
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~rCb2jyM3shqeP-8nW5FRKA~Had lunch here today with Rand H and Mike C and compared to other Chinese buffets it's just okay.  Nothing was really bad (except the Lo Mein noodles that tasted like they cooked in a burnt pan) and nothing really stood out as being really good.  I guess they recently did the flooring, and I found it to be very slippery, not good when you're carrying plates of food.  They had a decent selection of the typical items found on similar buffets.  I did find most of the appetizer stuff, like crab rangoon and pot stickers were a little too greasy.  The fried and breaded shrimp was tasty and I did like their style of egg foo yung.  The staff barely spoke English and when Mike asked what something on his plate was, our waiter thought he was asking for more and brought them to him.  The service was attentive, but would have been better if they understood what we were asking for.    I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I was in the area and hungry and wanting a Chinese buffet, I'd definitely give them another chance.~lo mein crab rangoon shrimp egg ~3
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~sVPb9d_6YXbD_G2lYBNKrQ~From the vending machines in the entryway selling gun and lowrider stickers, to the white plastic menu board hung partially askew, to the cheap-ass jewelry on sale laying out on top of the cash register desk, to the toothpick wrappers and various other little pieces of garbage on the floor in the foyer, to the fish pond with a single sad (possibly dead) koi, just about everything in the place screams "We really don't give a crap". That's the first impression.  Why 2 stars, then? Why not one?  Because the food was actually not . .. that . . . bad.  Still, if you're after Chinese buffet, try the one at 15th Av and Bethany instead.~white ~2
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~M02WW1DHpao_x7PRKovcUQ~Captain's Log, Stardate 2009-09-17.    Stopped in this junction of the galaxy last night with three friends after spending all day moving my Captain's Quarters.  I was sporting my skimpy blue retro work-out shorts with white trim, as I was tired and wasn't in the mood to even change.  I garnered a few odd glances (such to be expected) but we were quickly seated.  I tend not to do buffets now, as I'm really trying to watch my weight, but this place was recommended to me by my Lieutenant.  I'll be beating him later, but I digress.    The food was pretty marginal overall.  It was definitely NOT hot enough.  Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this.  Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and then charge me $8 cubits a head for same.  Some items were better than others.  I almost think there were too many choices.  I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved.    As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades.  Not last night, not today and certainly not tomorrow.  I'd rather chase Khan with a crippled ship in a nebula before I dine here again.  Overall, C-  There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it.  "Engage long range scanners, Mr. Sulu.  We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector."  :D  --don~white sushi ~2
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~nOK_kCGsPQwaB1Mc3I1z8A~Yes, I realize I'm probably risking my health by coming here but I just can't help but like it anyway.  It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise. They even have basic sushi rolls. That's a major plus in my book! Everyone seems to go for the crab, but I don't. If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out. Hustle your butt to grab choice pieces before everyone else.  Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English. There's always a language barrier. They're really only there to clear plates away.  You shouldn't look around too much while there. The whole place is pretty divey but the food is good & replaced often enough. If decor is important to you don't come here. If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness then drop by. You'll leave stuffed & happy.~sushi ~4
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~VeJ8LhHoq0DJ_vuTSGRsfg~Went here for lunch with Rand H. and this place is big for a chinese buffet , it is in the shell of an old Sizzler. The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average.they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good..So yes i would go back even though it is not one of my favorite chinese buffet but it is a good one.~chicken oranges shrimp ~4
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~DAELzMcTAjX1RK8I9phnEw~OK - this is a Chinese buffet so I don't think 5 stars is even possible.  Their quality can waver, probably as much by time spent on the steam tables as any other reason.  Their fried shrimp, hot and sour soup are generally very good. Most everything is in the typical range. They always have poached salmon but the steam table is capable of making it uneditable but when not destroyed on the steam table, it's generally quite good.  Friend said that their sushi was decent but I this doesn't strike me as a place to eat sushi.  Evenings and weekends are priced higher but they generally have crab legs and beef ribs.  Staff is generally friendly and attentive.~shrimp, soup salmon sushi sushi. beef ribs. ~3
8Sbs3VDs3KQnawJZR-77MA~5R4c_g4G6rLD433knuGQuw~I shan't be returning.  Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought "why not Chinese?"  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.  Being greeted on the way in with a "You are on camera" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.  But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.  The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the "orange chicken" from the "sesame chicken" from the "pepper chicken" by any sense other than sight.  The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).  The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.  They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.  Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.  I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.~chicken orange chicken ~1
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~SjgayD75MU7yTWEs_cGbwg~It was hit or miss for us.   We got burgers and first off, the bread. They looked like the 8 pack burger buns you get for an outdoor cookout. They looked and tasted cheap.   I got the A1 Mushroom burger and it was pretty good, except I ordered medium well and it was pretty well done even tasted a bit of a char (not a good thing, IMO). My wife got a burger that was flavorless.  The service was great. The beer was great. Decor of the place was great. It was just the food that left a little to be desired.  It was cool to have a TV at the table, probably a great place to watch the game with the guys.~burgers burger mushroom burger burger ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~vPcoXzJbA9U77RYkPwxXbw~I had heard some bad reviews about Brewstone, especially about the service there. So I was not expecting a great time when I walked in on Wednesday night but I was pleasantly suprised. First off, I have to get this off of my chest...I was a huge fan of John Harvard's. I was a member of their Mug Club from the moment they started it, and I miss it horribly. So naturally I was very disappointed that the brewing equipment is gone. Don't let the name fool you, Brewstone Beerhouse is not a brew pub. However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*.  The service was very good. Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar. The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area, but in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter. The personal TV's in the booths will make for good Football and Hockey seasons. I enjoyed my visit and Brewstone is definitely somewhere I will be visiting again.~burger ( ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~cmu62LdCBwqKiDDHciNXPg~Nice design and sporty atmosphere surround you in this large detailed restaurant.   Food is decent. Ordered mac and cheese but got more of a penne Alfredo instead. It wasn't bad but not quite what I ordered. Oh...and I'm clear the server was high...  Good for sports and beer I'd imagine.~mac and cheese ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~raC3BDXbIDuE3HDcqjEMnw~I got the feeling that Brewstone isn't exactly sure what it wants its identity to be.  There are a large number of beers, but as far as I know, none are brewed by Brewstone.  There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge.  Booths each had their own individual TVs (along with several TVs on the walls) but there are also fireplaces and other items that didn't seem to go with the individual TVs.  The menu is equally as mixed.  There are traditional bar favorites, but then there were some "fancy" things as well.  The nacho appetizer is HUGE.  The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full.  It was tasty, but they should consider cutting the portion and the price.  Or at least having a half order option.  The corn chowder is amazing.  I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone.  The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK, but nothing remarkable.  We'll probably be back to try other dishes and possibly happy hour specials (half priced martinis), but we won't be rushing back.~corn chowder ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~EJS_zLsSBw4lEVsAqWo7LQ~This place is in transition from "Brewstone Beer Co." to the "Breakway Bar and Grill" and is under new management.   Restaurant: L shaped setup. Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an "O" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeep  Drink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor.   Food: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be.   Atmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games.   Staff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way.   Overall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before. Would have 4-5 stars if they would go back to some of the things that originally made this place the way it was.~steak, chicken, burgers, burgers. ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~WQ_FoP2u5cDLmDPtRWcBKA~The Brewstone was perfect for a casual dinner and drinks. We went on a Saturday night and there was no wait, our booth was comfy and had a tv along the wall. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a flight of three different beers. They had a large selection of beer to choose from and the food menu was great. The prices were good and the food we got was very good.~appetizers ~5
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~rMl62nP4uNoKEZ3ogqEKlg~Back a second time. Not good let me tell ya.  This time a burger. I expected better, way better. This burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block. If you know what that is. Why would they send that out to someone to eat. Disgrace in the back. Who is in charge back there. Onion soup was so-so. Blah. Called the manager and told him, they need to do something in the kitchen, because I would really hope they could be better. Why, well the environment here is outstanding, a great venue, and the beer is good enough.~burger. burger onion soup ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~g_eYcrmaoz5z1F-6MDdARQ~My wife and I dined here on a Wednesday night (2/5/14), and at first, we were very upset and told each other that we would never come back again.  We asked to speak to a Manager, and the manager Carrie was extremely friendly, customer service oriented, and helped make our visit a much better experience.  We will be back thanks to Carrie fixing the issues with our meal.  Long story short, we waited 35 minutes for our appetizer which was just cheese sticks, and then waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our dinner.  My wife ordered a burger which ended up coming out like a brick it was so overcooked.  I ordered the boneless wings with mild sauce and the wings were overcooked, and cold when I got them.  It looked like they were actually put in the microwave by the way the sauce was by the time I got them.  After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we were not happy at all.   The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it.    Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly.  Carrie also compensated us the check for the wait time and the food being messed up the first time around.  Turns out that there were 2 parties of over 30 people booked at the same exact time and the kitchen ran behind.~cheese burger burger, ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~kTjxtSEntf2iMndT0Edd7g~I had a great experience at Brewstone.  I miss John Harvards and am really glad they put a similar restaurant in that space.  The server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers.  She recommended a terrific wheat beer that I very much enjoyed.  The portions were huge and you really get what you pay for.  The food is also very good.  I just bought a gift certificate for Brewstone to have an excuse to go back.~wheat ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~Qht0D2C7efjBdTHMBZaSGA~Perhaps most the opening week jitters have been corrected.  We stopped in last night for dinner and were very impressed.  As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless. They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location.   Two bars seems odd however but both were relatively busy.   I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry. It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries but both were good, so I can't really complain for the price. Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced.  Draft beer list was certainly bigger than I expected from earlier reviews.   Having a TV inside every booth seemed excessive, but should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street.  At least none of them had volume on.  Wait staff seemed very attentive but this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate.   A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit.  We'll definitely be returning again to try the rest of the menu and catch the drink specials during a steeler game.  Glad to see something different than just another chain restaurant move in the empty spot in Penn Center.~chips fries bbq pork ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~vjbdZXowo4hUwKKOkfXBvQ~Since I work long hours, many times the criteria for a restaurant is how late it's open.  Sometimes, you get both (open and good).  Brewstone was both!.  We have driven past this place a zillion times and never gave it a second thought.  Last night, we needed a late night place so we stopped in.  First of all, it is GIGANTIC.  There are several dining rooms.   We were seated in one of the bars areas.  Honestly, if you like sports this is your place.  There were about 40 televisions just in this one space (this includes a personal TV at each table.  We ordered some late night snacks.  My fiance ordered their fish and chips special.  He loved it.  It was crisp and very fresh.  Wasn't as enthusiastic about the fries. But all in all, he was happy.  I ordered wings.  I did half Teriyaki and half Buffalo.  Maybe it was the time of day I was eating them, but the Buffalo wings were crazy hot (spicy).  I preferred the teriyaki ones better.  They were all fresh and juicy.    The service was good.  We will probably return.  Maybe for some March Madness?~chips fries. ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~cmh78s_68CQ52c8otUvKQQ~Brewstone is BEAUTIFUL.  Twinkly patio lights, huge, Sonoma-esque vibe inside...seriously, just gorgeous.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing it has going for it.  We arrived and promptly checked out the huge specials board on entry.  It was Wednesday, so patio pint night.  $3.50 craft drafts?! Sign me up.  We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio.  We asked our server to be moved to the patio.  We moved to the patio, where our new server tells us the special: half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special.  For Ladies' Night.  Whatever.  We order beers anyway and hope for the best.  We order nachos that have no meat ingredients listed in the menu (unless you opt in), and they come smothered in beef chili.  NOT cool for vegetarians.  Especially when most of the entrees here are approaching the $20 range, I don't want to be surprised with "secret ingredients."  While eating, we overhear two parties next to us request to speak to the manager.  Not a good sign.    Bill takes 45 minutes to arrive after requested.  Beers aren't on special.  We pay full price and high-tail it out of there.  Not going back!~lettuce wraps ~1
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~lu2B2v8z4axXqts8B68vhw~This place is under new management. It is no longer called the Brewstone. The food was so so and there was nothing super spectacular about it. I had a wedge salad which was OK except for the fact that the bleu cheese dressing was not bleu cheese dressing. I had mussels for dinner. They were extremely over-cooked. Everyone else had a burger and they all came out wrong or missing an ingredient.  The beer selection was decent and current.  The wait staff was great which counters for the ignorant hostesses.  The two girls were not welcoming.  They sous there and looked at us and didn't acknowledge us or the other people who came in at the same time.  They stood begins the counter which is in an odd place as you didn't know it was a host stand.~salad cheese cheese burger ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~oybedrhdMyFoOWT8yzfJVw~This is a tough place to review...  The decor... 4.5 stars.  Lots of seating options indoors and out.  Tons of TV's available for game day viewing.  The menu... 3 stars.  It's got the usual sports bar fare, but because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering.  Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??  The food... 4 stars.  Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon), but for $10 you'd think you get more than 8 wings per serving.  Both flavors tasted pretty good; though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor.  We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers.  Very flavorful and moist.  The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet.  The service... 1 star.  Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.  I only saw one table in the large dining room.  So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow.  Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food, but she kept a smile and responded politely.    The pricepoint ... 3 stars.  The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food.  $10 for a burger, etc.  In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought.  If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry, then it might have been okay.~white garlic garlic garlic nachos - burgers. burgers. burger, ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~sQL_M2D95MOsYhigKwNp6A~Food Hounds... every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor.  Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.  The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.  The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.  Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself; this is certainly not a place to be missed.  We'll be sure to pop in next time we're in town - especially for those nachos... Hmm... if I leave now...~nachos nachos. tortilla chips ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~tP-ZN9VG3UOj1rT5VicMxQ~This place looks amazing! The beer choices seem really good. The food is really not worth the price.  Our server never mentioned anything special though we said we were new too the place. We asked what was great and she said, "Well, pizza is really good, but our pizza chef isn't in yet. Everything else is decent." (1pm on a Sunday). Not a good sign at all. We should have known by how empty the place was.   So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be "overpowering"--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild, but I asked for it anyways). Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.  Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.  Beer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle. Food wasn't good. Service was, meh. In an empty restaurant, you expect servers to be accessible.  We always go twice in case it was just a fluke, but judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place.~pizza pizza burger, cheese bacon ( cheese cheese burger bacon lettuce burger-- burger. tuna salad tuna salad tuna greens. salad ~1

0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~vGVNvYIEk_M7UiNZT0W4uA~as with everyone else, the decor is very nice and very inviting.   Other than that, well, it ends there.    The beer selection is good, but no one knows anything about beer there and the waitress tried to pretend like she knew.  Waitress was rude, messed up our order, took 25 min (empty restaurant). The burgers we ordered were burnt, we ordered medium, and the soup tasted frozen out of a bag.   After we received our check, the waitress disappeared, not asking us for additional drinks etc.... We chose to walk up to the bar and order additional beers,   the bartender was mute at best.   Upon leaving, we said goodbye to both hostesses, but they were too busy texting and talking to each other and we didnt even get a thank you, have a good night, whatever.     Management NEEDS to take a deep look at how they train people.  One person, we could understand, but the whole staff was uneducated.  Its a shame, cause this place could have soo much potential and we want it to succeed.   thousands of dollars on decor and frozen food does not make a restaurant.~burgers soup ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~ytggfFuxud9xuu5OQONdvg~My husband and I tossed around ideas of where to go for dinner on a Saturday night (3/08/14) with another couple. Our friends suggested "Breakaway Bar & Grill" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by. Our friends arrived before us and put our name in for the waiting list. The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude. She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, "No. you aren't being seated. Just want to asks you a question." Well. Ok?   We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing. We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders. Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order. The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced.  I ordered a burger to be cooked "medium" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza. When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best. My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made. Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management but was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food. Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses.   Needless to say, we won't be returning due to poor attitudes & over-priced below average food.~burger sweet potato ~1
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~T2jl3thjA_5iluOY3rGNDQ~brewstone has one problem that holds them back. Their service is absolutely terrible. their food is delicious, great beer selection. but when it takes 45 minutes to get appetizers or 15 minutes for a draft beer its unacceptable. I have went here three times at different times of the week and have expierenced the same problem.~appetizers ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~2j_wIlBE2U8gthpeV53-nQ~Had dinner here with friends.  The place was not very crowded but the food and service was terrible.  I had a chicken dish that was so salty i simply could not eat it. Our server never returned to fill our drinks or ask us how the meal was.  I can not recommend this place.~chicken ~1
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~quWBJERqHLFs0Tc2QGxnwQ~Was a cool place.  The food was alright and they have a decent selection of beer.  The place is huge and has a big outside.  The only drawback with the outside is the only view you have is a sweeping expanse of parking lot.  I ordered coleslaw with my dinner and it looks to be homemade!  There were big pieces of cabage all through instead of shredded cabage like you normally see.~coleslaw ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~2vDatxM5pxL5g1ISrvG56g~I went here for a happy hour/light dinner and sat in the bar.  The booth was extremely comfortable and i love the TVs at the table.  Others have had issues with both the food and/or the service.  Luckily, everything was good for my group.  Our server was both friendly and efficient - she did explain that the restaurant is undergoing a transition to a new brand, "Breakaway Grill" and therefore the menu was a little different and the beer list wasn't up-to-date.  I asked for an IPA and she was able to rattle off a handful that they DID have on draft.  Food came out quickly and the potachos were decent but could have used a bit more cheese.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread - and it was good.  I would go back here.  Granted it wasn't extremely busy so I can't speak to how the service would have been if they had been busier.~date. cheese. bbq chicken ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~-8yLrNavEY4dR7RuAmFsgQ~I like brewstone. I live in Monroeville, and it is one of the few places that isn't a chain. The place is big, and it attracts a wide variety of people. This isn't my first choice of place to go on a Friday or a Saturday night, but it's an alternative if I don't want to drive to shadyside. Their food is good. I like the margarita pizza the best. They have a decent number of brews. I'm not crazy about their live entertainment.~pizza ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~QPnzO9PZ_yiULWnxp9IMpw~The atmosphere is warm and modern. The bathrooms are beautiful. The nachos are heaping. The draft beer selection is vast. The service is terrible. I went here on a bike night. Usually bike nights are informal sit where you want but this place was different. The hostess had to go and see if there were tables available. This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table. Which she did not need to do. She did not know the specials. Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table. No one sat at the table the whole time we were there. We moved closer to the fire. Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us but a few minutes later. She barely knew the specials. We ordered our drinks. The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg. No big deal, but it did happen. I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any. I asked a manager as well. The cards on the table said food specials. He said there were none. Then the waitress brought the check. Our beers were full price. She told me it was the beer tax. They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax. She fixed it after this was pointed out to her. On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening. He did not get my opinion and will not be getting my money again. I gave it 2 stars versus 1 because I did not try the food. If the food is bad then this place is a 1 star. The service is poor. I will not be back.~nachos ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~MI0_X6bGx9yJxDn-AlRzgA~Good atmosphere. Good decor. Great beer selection. $5 craft beer pints, typical on what you would pay for those. Waiter was knowledgable about the beer. Food was ok. We had a salad and pulled pork and it wasn't anything amazing for the price.  TVs at every booth was really cool and plenty more around to view every game~salad pulled pork ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~qAbnmxeNslEvn7M8mdIVgA~Saw this place when driving in Monroeville and stopped in, turned out it was opening week so I hope it gets better.  For a place called Brewstone, I was expecting a place that brewed their own beer.  not only do they not, but  they had one of the worst beer selections I've ever seen at a bar, although their online menu listed dozens of beers as "coming soon"   Our waitress was unfamiliar with the beer selection they did have as well. The food was not very good either, I had chipotle chicken sliders and they were bland with no hint of chipotle and the chicken was tough to the point I felt like I needed a kinfe to cut it.    The best thing I have to say about this place is that it was very clean, but it's only been open for a week.~chicken chicken ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~oLrtGpr0dPPQmNXhA8Emsg~We were very excited to have a new restaurant open in the former John Harvard's space, as it's very close to our house and we go out to eat often. The Brewstone interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, and a gorgeous stone double-sided fireplace. It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere).   I really wanted to love Brewstone. We first tried it for dinner on Sept. 19. Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic, and we were forgiving as it's a new place. Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average.   We tried Brewstone again last night, 9/24. Service was again very slow. I can understand that the kitchen gets backed up, but I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. And when my beer arrived... there was a gnat floating in it. I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar. The bartender replaced it with a "sorry" without any sincerity.   We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best. The fries are not so great either.   So... I'd give Brewstone 5 stars for ambience/decor, and perhaps 1 1/2 stars for food and service. I sure hope that it improves, I really want to like it.~tacos) pizza fries ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~cApWjl-eu1Shu5M1QpD8Hg~Decent draft selection and local brews including full pint church brew works all saints rivertowne and east end.  Excellent staff and really good burgers.  Fun sports bar atmosphere with a touch of class.  Too bad it is under new ownership.  Hopefully the new owners don't change much.  We have been here many times and always leave happy.~burgers. ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~PTjIwQP6H6QXMKMtBXwibg~To be fair, it has been several months since I visited Brewstone, so things may have changed since then (hopefully for the better).  I am not writ ting this just to be critical; I am hoping the management will read this and make some much needed changes.  Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that "format"...  Strike one:  Brewstone is not a brewpub, which is what I was expecting.  The "beer experience" is severely lacking as the "beer menu" was very confusing.  Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a "citrusy, hoppy beer," (which equates to an IPA) or a "dark, sweet beer," (a stout).  Being a minor beer snob, I found the process bewildering as I had to guess at what I was going to get.  They should just tell you it's a "Stone IPA," or "Founder's Breakfast Stout," instead of letting you "guess."  Strike two:  The service was less than stellar.  Again, this may have improved, but after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay.  Our waitress (a very young woman) seemed to really be trying, but it seemed like she wasn't trained very well.    Strike three:  The food, again wasn't great.  I got a burger and it was so-so.  My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad.  Our 2 friends weren't impressed either.  I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered..... dunno.  Overall, we were disappointed and underwhelmed.... and we really wanted to like the place.... there aren't too many places in Monroeville that I really like.  I hope the management reads these reviews and makes so much needed improvements.~burger salad. ~2
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~AVuawXh3xLDxxrApLXNupg~The atmosphere was great, good decorations, and a TV on every table let us view an unobstructed Pens game.   The food was average. The fish and chips had an average batter, but the the large pieces of cod were cooked perfectly. The fries were good as well.   The waiters all seemed nice and energetic.~chips fries ~4
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~HbAmvrc3eSyzv-WlfVq9lQ~The place just opened last week, and I came on Wed night. The interior is enormous with two separate bar areas, a large dining room separated into two spaces by a dividing wall, and an outdoor patio space. The place is full of flat screen hdtv's, and will be a magnet for football fans on weekends in the fall. They have a major high-end sound system throughout the place (which was sadly playing 70's/80's pop music accompanied by videos on some of the tv's). The a/v investment is very impressive.  I have no doubt this place will be popular. The menu is full of reasonably priced classic sports bar fare like wings, nachos, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I stayed safe and went with bbq chicken wings for app and a cheeseburger for dinner. Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.  I have a couple of things to call out: 1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap. 2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.  Don't come for the culinary experience. This place is about sports on tv, and music when no sports are on.~nachos, pizza sandwiches, burgers, bbq chicken ~3
0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ~bflobTgQaI1y0lIObH2oYw~What a wonderful place! We ate dinner here for the 1st time a few nights ago(and it happened to be bike night). The place is very clean and the décor is beautifully done with a lot of woodwork and stone...very inviting, comfortable, and pleasing to the eye. The beer selection is why I came, and it did not disappoint! Excellent! A large and varied selection that is sure to please us discriminating beer drinkers out there. As for the food...I sampled the 4 different meals that were ordered for my table and it was all excellent, well prepared, and presented well. I personally had the fish tacos, which were phenomenal! The menu was just right, as well--good selection but not so much as to overwhelming you. The service: well, let me say this: I came for the beer. But I will return because of the service. I was amazed at the level of expertise and service our waitress exhibited, along with her genuine concern for our happiness and enjoyment. She was spot on with everything. THIS is the kind of service I live for! Our server's name was Kerri(sp?), and I give her and Brewstone my highest recommendation.  Well done!~tacos, ~5
1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g~b8Db0RH1ttdnJmFcJtlxVQ~This was a pretty cool experience and great way to do something away from the strip, not to mention a unique experience in itself (wine tasting in NEVADA, of all places). Before an annual holiday trip to Vegas, I stumbled across this activity as something I could redeem my Chase credit card points for, so I went ahead and did it and I'm glad I did! My girlfriend and I like going to Vegas every year but this was just what we needed to keep it interesting.  The hour-long bus rides to and from Pahrump were comfortable and informative, with Mikko being our guide and doing an excellent job. The blind tastings on the bus were fun even if I didn't do so well! The wineries were nice and the people that worked there and gave out tours were amazing! I learned A LOT about how wine is made in general and in a place like the Nevada desert at the first winery, Pahrump Valley Winery. The folks doing the tastings were also very pleasant, especially Jack, the owner of the second winery, Sanders Family Winery -- he was hilarious, very knowledgeable and just great to listen to. He makes you feel like you're family and just having a glass of wine with a friend.  As for the wines...well, wine is a matter of taste and I'm pretty much like Thomas Haden Church's character in Sideways where I think it all tastes the same, but there was one wine (Burgundy) at Sanders Family Winery that I really enjoyed to the point I bought a bottle, not something I usually do while wine tasting (typically the tastings themselves satisfy my wine craving for months). I've always been more into wine tasting for the experience and beauty of the vineyards, and the two wineries met that requirement as well. Finally, the lunch at Symphony's was VERY good. I had the grilled chicken panini with steak fries and it hit the spot, especially after all the tasting.   It is worth mentioning that there is A LOT of wine included in this. Two lengthy tastings at two wineries (plus tasting any other wine you want after lunch at Pahrump Valley Winery) and the blind tastings on the bus was quite a bit...I won't say too much because I did, after all, sign up for wine tasting, but it came to the point by the end of the day I was sure I didn't want to drink wine again for a loooonnnnggg time. It didn't help that the second winery, Sanders Family Winery, didn't have any crackers or anything of the sort to go with the wine (I recommend you bring some), but it was only a minor scratch on an otherwise great experience I highly recommend!~chicken steak fries ~5
1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g~PnwctXotNxvdZU4wjBmR6A~Looking forward to gathering a group of friends and taking this tour again! Had such a great time! Discovered a few wines that I'd like to purchase more of. Met some great people (Alan was a great guide!) and had an awesome gourmet lunch.  (The lobster bisque soup & the Barbera wine were my favorites!) Booking the tour and meeting the shuttle bus for pick up were easy and convenient. Highly recommend!!~soup & ~5
1FkUTet5GQ5mVwNLw_Ds4g~xiYjaXwkFAU6QLqKPOoKpQ~This was a great experience from start to finish! You would think a one hour bus ride from the strip to Pahrump would be boring, but you'd be wrong! They get the wine sampling started early by doing a blind taste test on the bus, as well as keeping the guests occupied with plenty of information about the history of both Las Vegas and Pahrump. Our tour guide, Mikko, was very knowledgeable and kept things fun.  The wineries are interesting and it was cool to see that certain types of grapes can thrive here in Southern Nevada. We got to taste over 20 wines throughout the entire day, most of which were delicious! Lunch at Symphony's was also delicious -- I got the French dip sandwich and steak fries, both of which were of great quality.  Both winemakers were knowledgeable and hospitable. The second winemaker, Jack Sanders, is just a blast with his witty humor.  By the end of the day, you will most likely be a little "wined out" - 20+ samples is no joke... But if you have a free Saturday or Sunday and need an excellent date idea, or just a fun way to spend the day with a wine-loving family member, I strongly recommend Imbibe Tours!~grapes french dip sandwich steak fries, date ~5

Variety of eggs, sausages, French Toast, pancakes, fresh fruit and coffee/fruit juices. Just show up hungry and you'll enjoy the place.~sausages, french toast, pancakes, ~4
6zLxqXt4IEXbCH4d7T_6GQ~_qTfh47LezUpnVZ767fv4w~Sometime during my recent review-writing hiatus Vivek messaged me to ask if I'd been anywhere cool recently worth reviewing.  Cool. No. But exciting and worth reviewing for an individual of a certain demographic? Hell yah!   That's right.  On behalf of all the homebodies out there let me be the first to review the Corningware Corelle Revere Store in the hinterlands of Dufferin and Sheppard.   I have a nice Corningware casserole dish, you know, the nice white one with the fluted edged that you'd being to potlucks.  It was woefully underused in everyday applications because it only had a clumsy, albeit pretty, glass lid that neither sealed nor allowed for stacking.   I also have a square pyrex dish that was missing a plastic lid thanks to a mischievous puppy.     Enter the Corningware Store. Not only do they have the lids for my orphaned Corningware and Pyrex dishes, but they also have all sorts of kitchen gadgetry and essentials with an emphasis, of course, on food containers.   It would actually be an amazing place for a housewarming gift, or a very practical wedding gift, or a just-because-gift for your friend of a certain demographic.~white ~4
6zLxqXt4IEXbCH4d7T_6GQ~bL1PYGPpfmBt4Z4ZBpzJ2w~I confess I love my Corningware containers, casserole and especially my soup mug which I use so often at my work place.  The staff here are just so helpful and friendly! Asking us if we need help, telling us what's on special (50% off knives and cutting boards).  Price are quite compatible but I definitely won't be paying anything unless there is a sale :).   Great store to browse around as there are much more than just Corningware!~soup ~3
6hZHlfwknQVVAoQVQr3_ag~aJ1nr989d-7t8pBfejZpGQ~It would break my heart if I had to give Baskin & Robbins a bad review. I would if I had to but I'm glad they've never given me reason.   Gosh, I've been eating their ice cream for years (not sayin how many) and my poison of choice is pralines and cream. It's also my mother's favorite and was my grandmother's favorite..so you see what's going on here. I have deviated from the plan and tried other flavors like strawberry, salty caramel and mint chocolate chip, to name a few. What makes them stand out is their ingredients. I mean, I'm eating real ice cream. I can't speak about the cones, shakes or other specialty items because I never tried them. You come here when you mean business.   Parking sux when there's a bunch of traffic but I see some park across the street which may be a better option for some.   Employees seem nice...I mean they're scooping you ice cream. The store is clean and is a great place to cool off while enjoying your tasty treat in the summer!~ice cream caramel ice cream. ice cream. ~5
6hZHlfwknQVVAoQVQr3_ag~YZebJnw-SuVSZpNLpXzUaA~A Prime example of what franchisees are unprofessional and have nonexistent health standards.  Came in for my free birthday scoop. Showed the coupon to the cashier, a young brunette. Replied "uh, it has to be printed". Doesn't say on the coupon, nor does it state it in the store.   "Oh and also, you have to tell me first. Because it's a smaller scoop "  Actually, there are not "two sizes" of "one scoop". Just another example of cheap franchisees lowering the standards.  The icing on the cake is, I ask, "well I'm not driving back home to print this out. So are you simply going to pitch it?"  "Nope!" She says cheerfully. "I just put them back!" And that she did, do the disgust and dismay of this reviewer.  I have informed the ACHD, the health department.   I am a small business owner. When others are so deeply unprofessional, it merely drives consumers straight into the hands of corporate America.   If they are so cavalier about tossing ice cream already served back in their containers in full view of customers, there's no doubt a host of other, worse  violations they comitt behind closed doors.~cake ice cream ~1
6hZHlfwknQVVAoQVQr3_ag~1P08d67vlP35rqHs13c08w~Very convenient location on Freeport Road. Staff were very friendly, especially to our little one, and gave her a couple of little tastes of some different flavors to help her make up her mind. As with any Baskin Robbins, they have 31 great flavors at all times - happy to see they haven't ever gotten rid of the chocolate and peanut butter!~peanut butter ~4
6hZHlfwknQVVAoQVQr3_ag~cxRbtgvyKsjgdkkPGY2RIA~Great ice cream and many flavors to choose from. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. Parking is tricky when u leave because u back out into traffic on the main drag. The price of the ice cream is ridiculously high. Two scoop sundae was over $5.00 a banana split was nearly $7.00 I don't know of many locations and with those prices they may not last long. I hope they do though.~ice cream ice cream banana ~3
556i_WzeMeptcpd7ALQroQ~ANy6L3mronIx9enAfQTfIQ~Dance Fabulous is a great place to just dance, have fun, and get a bit of a workout. There is no pressure to be a good dancer, or to have any dance experience. I regularly go to the hip hop classes, and I've dropped in on a few others - break dancing, salsa, zumba. And there are still more I haven't had a chance to try yet.  The instructors are all friendly, funny, make class really enjoyable. And they often attend each other's classes, so you know they really just love dancing. And there is a really personable group of regulars that make the classes a lot of fun.~salsa, ~5
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~qQQV5eQU4YazNxTmbvAHNQ~I went to the Avro for the first (but not last!) time last week end for some late night drinks with a couple friends. I'll definitely be back.  I really loved the tiny, cozy space. And tiny it is! It's actually very surprising how roomy and big the bathroom was compared to the size of the bar.  Mill Street Organic on tap was a BIG plus for my guy friends. And delicious $3 birthday cake was a bonus for me :) I also enjoyed watching the bartender dig the cake out of the back of the fridge from behind multiple orange juice cartons. I was a bit leery at that... 'is this cake gonna be stale as an old toenail? yuck.' Nope. It was a delight. And a sparkler topped it off. In fact, when i tried to take a pic of my yummy birthday cake and the sparkler fizzled out, he gave me a whole new sparkler for my birthday photo op. Thanks!  The gin and tonics were good too.~cake cake cake cake ~4
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~rFLZRCTnqRHryz6YY6_YPA~Cozy, basic and laid back bar, great to hang out in before a show at the Opera House across the street. The only thing I would suggest is that the place was almost TOO dark. Some candles would be welcome in some of the darker nooks. Good music and friendly crowd! The brief menu included some intriguing "meat sticks" - does this mean jerky? I did not inquire.~jerky? ~4
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~ExuvW-abFEX5cXlfBZJ6og~Located right around the corner from my house, I pass by this little nook all the time and only realized it was a bar recently.  I came in here w a girlfriend for a low-key Saturday night to grab a drink, and were sitting at the bar. The very first thing that I noticed was that it was pretty much pitch black in here without the grace of a few dim lights behind the bar.   It was about 11:30pm and this cozy place was rammed!  When I say 'cozy', I mean you're actually squeezing your way in between seats and people that you can barely even see in a low ceiling little nook (I keep saying "nook" so much that I might just start referring to Avro by it haha).  The music they were playing was not bad, but seemed really loud in such a small place.  They have a few beers on tap, and a bunch of liquors as well.  There is no kitchen, so what you see is what there is... I think (I didn't quite explore, but it didnt seem like there was much to explore anyway).  They do have FIVE munchies selections, and my friend and I ordered 3 of the five.  Pickled Egg: $1 (2/5 stars) Kept in a big cookie jar behind the bar, I watched bartender fish one out for me.  It tasted like a hard boiled egg with vinegar, and I added tobasco to it.    Meat on a Stick: $1? (4/5 stars) Can't really go wrong with spicy cured sausages.  They were pretty much the thicker hot rods.  I think they were kept in the fridge since it was served cold.  Toasted Fluff: $1 (4/5 stars) This was our fave!  We watched the bar tender scoop up some marshmallow fluff with 2 teaspoons and then used a torch  to torch it.  That was it! We licked the toasted sugar off that spoon till it was clean!  One of the regulars at the bar told us we should have gotten the Campfire Shot and chased it with the fluff.  Sounds great! Maybe next time...  They also had mini packs of chips for $2 and birthday cake for $3 a slice!  Overall, this place is quite cute if you just want to come for a few drinks.  I will probably come back again on a weekday sometime and check out the atmosphere then.~egg: egg sausages. chips cake ~3
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~zSmRvR5JMbvI-gd2RGX50g~The Avro is the _perfect_ local.  Even though I'm not *that* local.  Walking in on Saturday night, The Avro smelled like vanilla sugar and Stiegl beer and joy.  So, basically: some of my favourite things.  The music was pumping, people were chatting (AND SMILING!  LET'S PUT IN A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO DO MORE OF THIS, K TORONTO?!), and we sidled up to the bar.  An orange-kissed beer was on tap.  Vodka sodas flowed easily.  We considered the food board: $3 slices of birthday cake, "meat sticks" and pickled eggs on offer.  Another plus of The Avro: outside food is welcome, so show up with your tub of hummus, slice of 'za, and bag of neon Cheetos...bienvenidos, all!    This joint is small, and chock-a-block full of delightful quirk.  Cheeky signs, Backstreet Boys album covers behind the bar, and a big jar of the 'forementioned pickled eggs.  Come here: drink one, drink all!    Yelp note: bring some chalk...you'll want to mark your time at The Avro on the chalkboard-painted bathroom walls (see my pics for visual confirmation).~cake, ~4
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~ZY7wH6ie273hq2Evw7w43A~The Avro is a pretty relaxed, comfortable place to go for a drink. We decided to try it out Friday night - getting there for around 8pm it was already pretty busy. The bar is quite small with a couch at the front, a few tiny tables that sit 2-3 people and plenty of seats going along the bar. We were able to get a seat no problem but if we'd shown up at around 9, we would have been out of luck or needed to squeeze in on the barstools.   As I said the place is much smaller then what I thought from the photos I'd seen. Don't let that deter you though! The Avro just might not be the venue to go if you have a large group. For 2 to 3, it's quite cozy and intimate with a great atmosphere. Eclectic decor throughout, and warm low level lighting.  The bartender was really cool, very attentive and aware - so saw my short self struggling to be seen behind all the people sat at the bar, and was able to get my order through quickly. The beer is cheap and good, just how I like it, and if you're feeling peckish they have birthday cake.  Apparently cheap pint nights on Thursdays if you show up in plaid and lots of events and live music regularly going on. If I lived East this would easily be my local and I plan on going back again in future when in the area.~cake. ~4
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~nmqYpPPXskzXWzaUW-Hi6A~This would be me on a daily basis.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-s2tLbqlOc&feature=youtube_gdata_player  My two vices are:  1) A dimly lit local where every nook and cranny has been planned to maximize comfort and cool.                          And  2) Birthday Cake!   The Avro wonderfully fulfills both of these. Whether lounging in the comfortably worn in chairs or standing at the bar to vociferously defend that Of Montreal album your friend hated, it's perfect! The fact that the wonderful bartender plays said Of Montreal album all the way through to get a rise out of him is just too awesome to ignore.   Well done, Avro!~cake! ~5
0zrKCCElrozCU7zb8mBDnw~wwWkWFyn4hv43PNnuNPcHQ~This isn't Ms. Lavigne's Avro, but maybe you'll find a skater boy or two (long boards only need apply).   The Avro's traditional bar and rustic trendy furniture made from trees adds a prohibition feel without the illegality.  Don't come here looking for specialty cocktails, but do visit The Avro for a full bar of traditional drinks made right.  The background music was just how I like it, hiptster-shazamable-rock--but not weird high pitched man voices over a synth.  Do you like ordering a birthday? well good, you ego-maniac. "Birthday Cake" is on the menu.  Order the cake and come out a year older, wiser and ... well ...not really, it's a cake -- not a time machine.  Avro is great.~cake" cake cake -- ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~cr6HZLw6P6nJyIMboka_Rg~Salted caramel macaron...*swoon* Their macarons were so good! We bought the early grey, espresso, creme brulee, chocolate and of course the salted caramel. They're a bit on the pricey side for a macaron but totally worth it! They were so good! I'm glad I don't live near their Yonge St location, otherwise I'd be broke and fat.  I'm not sure if they are really aiming to be a sit down place because it didn't seem like there was much in terms of a menu or drinks but who cares?? Get a macaron!~caramel caramel. ~5
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~PDASF2XnTwPRg5vZ6x_OaA~Apparently this location is where Ruelo makes all their macarons, including the ones for their Richmond Hill location.   I used a Groupon for a box of assorted macarons, and the flavours were all a bit off. It was like testing out different colored jelly beans. I didn't enjoy the Yuzu or Wasabi Grapefruit. Why can't I just have a macaron that's just plain Pistachio?   The macarons themselves were different in size and there was too much filling in proportion to the exterior shell.   Some may like Ruelo's creativity in mixing different/exotic flavours together, but I still like the basics better.~grapefruit. ~2
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~1yd-Wc_3fn5c4LLSM4tNGg~I wrote this quick review as I sat in the Patisserie itself and while walking around the neighborhood so please pardon any grammatical errors. Considering the macarons were $3.00 and $2.25, I had my expectations set quite high! Alas, I was to be greatly dismayed!   The $3.00 Ruelo tasted like a Ferro Rocher macaron...you would expect a Patisserie Chef from LCB with a Diplome de Patisserie to be a little more inventive. The hostess very sweetly mentioned that it tastes like the mass produced chocolate too. I mean if you are you going to create something that tastes like a mass produced chocolate...a. Why price it at $3.00 and b. Why make that of all your macarons your SIGNATURE macaron!!    Not sure if Chef Jacqueline Lo was trying to be adventurous with the recipe of the Salted Caramel Macaron! In addition to being hard and dry, it was also sticky... kind of almost like a Sticky Salted Caramel Toffee. If that was the taste she was going for...SPOT ON! If not, either I got a really bad batch or may I suggest the chef make some changes in the recipe.  My sister who had the Blueberry Cheesecake didn't seem impressed and told me the crust of the cake borders on overwhelming the taste of the cheesecake.   The reason I awarded Ruelo 2 stars is because my friend on facebook mentioned  that their Croissants were great and since I have tried it, I ll just have to take her word for it. On a plus side, great customer service!   If you are looking for French Patisseries in the neighborhood, La Bamboche is the closest and best bet.~caramel caramel cake ~2
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~xcCfjtqSiPfILBTD6e3L9Q~$5? For a Macaron!! That's my lunch there!  Ruelo Patisserie recently opens a second location just North of Yonge and Eglinton. I always a fan of Ruelo's macaron in the Richmond Hill's location and I am happy to see them expanding.  The Patisserie still smell like paint when I came by and they still putting in a lot of final touches before I would consider them "in business".  Black Truffle Macaron ($5) is made from real truffle shavings. I have to say I am bias as I always like macaron that has more complex flavour then just pure sweetness.... I would have to say I have a fan of the taste and concept. Since it is Ruelo grand opening, the owner was nice enough to offer this for me free to taste.  I also tried their Ruelo ($3) and Raspberry Lychee ($2.50) Macarons while sipping on an Americano ($2.50). They were all excellent...  This Ruelo Patisserie location will also has baked goods (bread) and of course pastries and cakes.  Welcome to the Neighbourhood! I wish them all the best and it will not be easy to compete with all these Patisserie in the area, this is NOT Richmond Hill!!~lychee ( pastries ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~-NktRWcGZC4d38MnTf0mZQ~After hearing mixed reviews for Ruelo, I finally decided to try it out since I was in the area and wow I wish I had spent my money elsewhere. $8.50 on three macaroons which were mediocre at best.   The girl there was not enthusiastic and did greet us but there were limited amount of macaroons left. I also walked out after looking at the selection but decided to try it since I was there. My friend and I ended up getting the Signature Ruelo, Raspberry and Cassis (Black Currant). After paying, she went to the back and we didn't even start walking out the door. We both felt she was rude and decided to eat it elsewhere. Mind you, the decor was really pretty with the purples and looked very chic.   The filling tasted bitter, each bite I expected something to stand out but it was nothing special and nothing outstanding. The only one that tasted decent was the Signature Ruelo unfortunately.  Would I come back? No thank you. I'll go spend my well earned money elsewhere.~currant) ~2
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~ntL7Xn87b9mzz3BOnd50XQ~I got three macarons, and found them to be pretty good.  However, I left my chocolate one for last (saving the best for last!), only to discover that I was given a coffee-flavoured one instead by mistake, which was disappointing.~coffee- ~3
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~nvCTO4edgEfIAoAm4ml1XQ~Afternoon tea *2 stars* Chocolate pastry dessert cake (Ruelo) *4 stars*  Went specifically for afternoon tea but it was a little disappointing.  I expected the sweets to be better considering it was a patisserie but, the best part of the 3 tiered afternoon tea set was the savoury appetizers!  Surprisingly, the macaroons offered were not the best, a little too sweet and a little on the artificial side.  Even at $15.99/person it could have been better!  The Kusmi tea was nice, not spectacular but aroma and taste were good.    Aside from the afternoon tea set, we also shared a chocolate pastry dessert,  It was a chocolate mousse dessert with vanilla creme brulee filing and crispy praline layered on top of chocolate cake .  The dessert was covered with dark chocolate ganache and gold leaf sprinkles.  It was really good, light and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness and a good balance of textures.  Buy again?  YES!  Service was on the plus side as it was friendly and we had several hot water refills. We also stayed long after we finished eating, but were still offered ice water.  I would skip the afternoon tea and stick with the desserts!  Some of the flavour combinations were also quite enticing and unique, so worth a check!~tea * cake ( tea tea appetizers! tea tea chocolate cake ~3
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~CtFzQWk8EvBQjh72tLhCJQ~I visit this location and their original one in Markham several times a year. It seems there are more unique macaron flavours available here tho.  I stopped by last weekend to see what they're offering and got real excited when I saw the last mandarin olive oil macaron in the display.  I had been waiting for this flavour ever since macaron day when Jacqueline (the owner) mentioned she will be experimenting with this flavour.  This was good, but when the only comparison I have is Pierre Hermé's mandarin olive oil, it's not quite there... it needs a bit more olive oil flavour. Still... Ruelo gets a solid 4 stars for having the best macarons in the city and using quality ingredients in their macs and cakes.~olive olive olive ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~03S-OQ-Owzl6H_pSzTnfQw~Came here courtesy groupon for the tea for two. I had read about their macarons and was looking forward to trying them here. They ask for one to reserve in advance which just alright as the other dinning companion had some dietary restrictions. Parking is quite close and reasonable in a Green P lot. We just confirmed and waited for the our stuff to arrive it consists of the following: Two scones with Devon cream and Kusmi jam (good) Mini danish (decent) Mini Atlantic smoked salmon sandwich on a scone (average) Mini shrimp salad sandwich served on a crispy crouton (average) Daily quiche (good) Macarons, crème brûlée, and banana bread (good) cappuccino (OK) Macarons actually have layered filling which is interesting. The baked good are worth a visit again. The service was kind of slow even though they were not busy when we dined.  I would say for desserts 3.5 stars.~tea smoked salmon ~3
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~tHMz0ETraE5cH3BQcI3VtA~The place is small but comfortable, good volume of music. Really liked how they had a variety of tea selection and there are actually testers which really helps you to choose the right kind of tea for you. The service is actually pleasant, smiled and greeted me upon arrival and asked me about the food after I'm finished. The food is okay, nothing too special. One if the desserts is pretty good with strawberry filling, forgot to ask for the name. The macaroons are good, had the blueberry lemon and had a blueberry filling inside of the middle layer. The overall experience is not bad, might come back again.~tea tea desserts lemon ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~2ediRxk4f_b1z3eJrZyitg~I came here three months ago when it just opened and bought 4 macaroons. Then I found out macaroons here are so pricey! $3-5 each depending on which one you get. But their texture is really nice compared to others. It's not too sweet, slight crunch on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside with a layer of delicious pastry cream and they are big in size. My favorite is fleur de sel caramel. I also got the earl grey, lavendar, and chocolate, but other people got to eat it.  I'll have to visit again soon so my review is a little more reliable :)~caramel. ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~XrdtI2Mcboa64-f6aYYA4Q~Came here earlier this week and was really excited to try something new - a little sugar never hurt anyone... So we went in and dazzled by the lovely colours and sights, my friend I ordered just two macarons - and lattes. I didn't bother trying the pastries as they didn't seem to look appealing - not bad, just not amazing for the price they were asking. I don't even think pastries in Paris were priced this high... We ordered the Rose Lychee and Pure Chocolate. After biting into them, I noticed mine had a slight freezer-burnt taste. My friend also noticed the same - after exchanging bites, it was confirmed - they were definitely directly from freezer. Maybe it was the day?  Not sure but it was a let down - simply because visually, they looked so good. We didn't finish them and won't go back :(~pastries pastries lychee ~2
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~Mhd8thqEz2QT8x9tbPAuKA~The storefront seems relatively average, nothing exciting, no fireworks going off here. I instantly regretted the three freaking blocks north I had to walk from where I was visiting to go to this place on a hot humid day. But since I was already here, displaced three whole city blocks away, I thought that I may as well check this place out. My laziness knows no bounds. The interior was arguably nicer, gives off the impression of a small quiet place, tucked away from the rest of the city.   What was I here for? Macarons of course. Ruelo Patisserie is truly inventive with their macaron flavours, they have your typical chocolate and vanilla macaron that every run-of-the-mill French bakery have, and they also have flavours like Green Tea Sesame, Yuzu and Wasabi Grapefruit (I'm seeing an Asian influence here, don't you?).    Please visit my blog to see more! Thanks a bunches ;)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/ruelo-patisserie.html~tea grapefruit ( ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~DvgVQVfnSzC_rbKsCKMMVg~Ruelo Patisserie is a little sleek and cute purple place right off Yonge st. The atmosphere in here is quiet and comfortable and the staff is very friendly.  Ruelo offers coffee/tea, baguette sandwiches for breakfast/lunch, sit in desserts, macarons, and bread. You can also order small cakes here and weddings cakes too. Prices here are steep; macarons range in price according to its flavor and can go up to $5 for one! Macaron flavors include: wasabi grapefruit, cream cheese orange, early grey etc. Small 6" cake here costs around $28.  They also have a very small list of espresso beverages and a nice variety of loose leaf Kusmi tea. I got an Americano ($2.95) and I didn't enjoy it too much- too watery and somewhat bitter. Tea here will cost you $3.75. Extra 75cents for iced or a slice of lemon. I wanted to pair my Americano with a macaron or sit in dessert but they had no desserts on the counter and only a small selection of macarons left over, no flavor which I was interested in. Also, I wanted to see their bread, but they did not have any. Prices for macarons, sandwiches, and cakes are not listed in the store which I didn't find too helpful.~sandwiches desserts, grapefruit, cream cheese ~2
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~Uu2UhwXTe9eK68bokfhMWg~Hands down, the best macarons I have ever had. I didn't expect this because the store in unassuming and was manned by a Chinese  teenage girl who didn't know much English, but the macarons are near perfect. I love the flavours, my favourite being the creme brulee and the rose-raspberry-lychee, and the macarons are just how I like it. A delicate shell with a moist, dense but still airy centre. The fillings were sweets but not to the point it is off putting.   I would definitely recommend it. I hope to try their cakes and afternoon tea sometime.~lychee, tea ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~7ZicTIJ2s3yjkTm75Pu44w~Desserts for a very special occasion, or perhaps a really extravagant tea party! The cakes and desserts here are so gorgeous and the flavours are unique.  I was first drawn here because of their lychee and raspberry macarons.  They also have a lot of other interesting options like yuzu and green tea.  It's just fun to try new spins on classics.    They also have individual serving cakes that look like small works of art.  You almost feel guilty cutting into them.  Their cakes are also one of a kind - I ordered a red bean, green tea and sesame birthday cake for my mom and it received rave reviews!  Each layer was created with such care and precision, and you were able to taste and enjoy each flavour.    My only thought is that I wish the cakes came in larger sizes.  These cakes are too special not to share.~desserts tea desserts lychee tea. tea cake ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~NNF31OZKuzK1Rf97ajjq9Q~We came here with a Groupon at around 3pm on a weekday. The service was kind and the the food came out on time. We were treated very nicely despite having a Groupon, I give the shop a bonus point for that. The tea was all right, but I've had better quality elsewhere, the boyfriend really liked his tea though. The foods were very good. I enjoys every item the were served on the tower. I especially liked the mango salsa,proscuitto and the macaroons they've included. Compared to afternoon tea at Windsor Arms, this place offered a much better selection of food/dessert items. Overall it was a very enjoyable meal.~tea tea mango salsa, tea ~4
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~cYr5ubQxB4Afy_8TEfIWwg~I attended the grand opening of this business on the weekend and was impressed by the variety and quality of the macarons. My favourite was definitely the raspberry lychee. Samples of the other goods on offer were okay, but I don't know if I would have paid the prices they ask for.  An iced latte was $3+ and the 14 oz mug was filled with about 3/4 ice! I had to knock some of the ice in the garbage so I wouldn't spill it on myself.  Overall I was very surprised by the limited number of things for sale. The cakes looked very similar and beautiful, but to be honest I didn't try any because they looked like mousse or cheesecake and I'm not a big fan. I thought they would have more cakes with fondant and other types of pastries.  If you are a macaron aficionado, this is certainly the place for you (if you're willing to pay their prices). I hope they can stay in business but with this limited offering it might be a challenge.  Note  - the tea here is amazing...and I never drink black tea otherwise!~lychee. pastries. tea tea ~3
61Llhn62hVdHy9t8c9LSuw~jKHUc-I1NnmV9IyJP2HL3Q~Their Macarons are one of the best I've had in Toronto with very unique flavours such as Green Tea Seseme and Wasabi Grapefruit!  They definitely taste ultra fresh.  I especially loved that they're not too big and not to small - the perfect size.  If you're a Macaron lover, you must visit this place.  Especially with the La Bamboche (yonge/eg location) closed, this will definitely be my new to-go place for a Macaron-fix.    I got a half a dozen packaged for a birthday gift for my friend, but I couldn't resist getting a couple for myself!  I got the Ruelo & Green Tea Seseme.  Both flavours that I haven't tried before.  The Ruelo contains milk chocolate ganache with a crispy praline center.  So yummy! I can see why this is their signagure flavour.  The Green Tea Seseme contains green tea ganache and a crispy black sesame praline center.  Very delicious as well.~tea grapefruit! tea milk tea tea ~4
7Y0OjNJZ2pmp7VdrzzB9Ng~6-z8ZqbfrehgWQ8E7jrnKA~I visited the ESCADA store on Bloor street in Toronto today and was very dissatisfied with the service we received.My friend was looking for a white pant suite and when we found the perfect item we had been looking for all day, we were shocked with the store representative who told us we were not allowed to try it on. We asked the sales representative for a size and she asked who it was for. My friend said it was for her and the sales rep looked her up and down and said "Oh" very rudely. My other friend not picking up on this said " Yes, we also saw a matching shirt we would also like to try on" and the sales lady turned to my friend and she "these clothes are for women only!". My friend turned bright red and said she would like to leave now. The sales rep then proceeded to say that there might be some jeans that might fit her. We walked right out of the store.  All of us are biologically women and were shocked to receive such horrible service from such a well known store for its quality and taste. My friend was incredibly embarrassed for being mistaken for the wrong gender and we were horrified that someone would tell someone they could not purchase the clothing they want to because they are not the "correct" gender for those items.   ESCADA, please remind your sales representatives that they should never guess the gender of a client based on appearances (not that my friend looks anything like a male) and that if looking someone up and down and giving them a look of disgust is completely unacceptable.  This incident cost your store thousands in sales today and we plan on sharing this experience with our social networks to discourage visiting this location.  May I recommend some sensitivity training followed by some customer service training since clearly both of these had been missed.~white ~1
7Y0OjNJZ2pmp7VdrzzB9Ng~B1t-U0TVjrJWLtOgV5UzOw~Escada is one of my favourite stores to shop at on Bloor street.  It is now located where Mendocino use to be and I find this location to be perfect, since its beside Sephora (another one of my favs). This store is well organized and up to date with seasonal trends which helps me go through the store with ease. Even though I consider myself a professional shopper and enjoy it very much but I dont like to stay longer than 20 minutes in a store. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a beautiful lady and I had the oppurtunity to an one on one shopping experience as she showed me the new fall/winter collection. I like the quality and style of clothing and that is why I keep coming back. I will say if your a person on a budget think twice, this is designer and prices can get ridiculous but to each their own. The only reason why I won't give this place a 5 star is because every time I shop here, this place is empty and it can get a little boring...that boutique music ain't cutting it. Any way, Im glad I don't have to cross the border when I can just go downtown now ;)~date ~4
53NomlztIy1NTFCtpIoP3A~4jFtkGv0aqoT4VaD1NoqHw~I generally love Swiss Chalet! The chicken, ribs and gravy are an quick and easy dinner solution. The service at this location was not very good. I ordered a half chicken dinner and the chicken was very, very dry. It was like they had kept it on a car engine or somewhere else that was warm  and uninviting overnight somewhere so that it could be served the next day. The experience has me turned off from eating any Swiss Chalet for a long while. In hindsight, I think I would have been better off getting breast meat and warm sides from the supermarket across the street.~swiss chicken, ribs chicken chicken swiss ~1
53NomlztIy1NTFCtpIoP3A~vche6G3KGZB4uoYGzTJZ1g~This Swiss Chalet location is only for take-out and delivery which works great for me.  I tend to stick with the chicken soup, which is amazingly hearty but once you order 3 (because for 2 ppl that like it a lot, 1 ain't enough) it comes to nearly the same price as two regular meals ($15!) so that sucks. That isn't this location's fault, though.   It's good and quick and convenient, so it's worth it when you don't want to stop by a busy restaurant.~swiss chicken soup, ~3
53NomlztIy1NTFCtpIoP3A~PkmXmKBqHIyS6vABT7aEJQ~I wanted Swiss Chalet and knew that there was one on the corner of Spadina / Bloor. Little did I know that when I walked in - it was mainly a take-out delivery spot with 3 high top chairs for quick eating. Didn't matter, I was getting take out anyway.  I'm not lying when I tell you I LOVE SWISS CHALET. It is my go-to comfort food and it is always consistent every time. It's been quite some time since I last ate it but I had no doubt that it would not disappoint. Sadly - my expectations were a whee bit high.. both on the food and the service.  There was no one at the counter when I walked in and waited several minutes before anyone showed up. I was watching the cook in the back as he continued to prepare his next order leaving for delivery. The girl was super nice and efficient but I had gotten a little impatient. The store smelled of major BO which made me want to leave as quickly as possible and the space was run down and dirty.  When I finally got home and hoped to enjoy the awesome quarter chicken dinner, I found that the white meat was rather dry, than the usual juiciness, even if it was white meat. The corn (side dish) was also dry, and over cooked - pretty sure it was microwaved. Surprisingly, the chalet sauce seemed rather salty (maybe it's just my tastebuds), but overall... a sub par dinner that I had high hopes for.  Maybe it's time to stick with dine in and dark meat........and ribs next time :)~swiss swiss chicken white white corn ( ribs ~2
4Ok7Xh7DSujMhe2uWhQdwg~nG-nxq-eaCXIhKpa-8sd8g~I imagine upon seeing this review you're asking yourself (or someone near you) incredulously whether "people still listen to radio?"  Firstly, pipe down this is my review...feel free to rebut at a later time :)  And secondly, don't be too shocked but it's true - I still listen to radio. And yes, before you ask, I have an iPod that I also listen to voraciously because apparently every moment of my life must have a soundtrack.  And while I don't remember how I stumbled upon the station a couple of years ago (though it's been on the air in Toronto for just over 30 years) what I do know is right from the get go, I was hooked.    Now rock (the focus is on classic rock but that covers more recent years then you'd think) isn't everyone's cup of musical tea but it's where my heart lies so rarely do I hear a song on the station I don't like or don't know.  To give a bit of background let me be clear that radio is my music comfort zone....I leave discovering new music for my web surfing hours 'cause that's just how I roll ;)  Aside from the fantastic music, the thing that keeps me hooked are the DJs and the various radio personalities. They all love what they do and love the music they play, that comes across loud and clear, not to mention the specialized knowledge they all seem to have spanning decades of music - which makes a nice change from the cookie cutter personalities on other Toronto stations that move from one station to another without blinking an eye.  The morning show with John Derringer, Maureen Holloway, Ryan Parker and Bill Hayes is incredibly entertaining each day and when you know how much I hate dragging my butt out of bed, you then know how good they have to be to make me laugh at 8 am.  Joanne Wilder (9 am - 2 pm) is great to listen to at work and Kim Mitchell (yes THAT Kim Mitchell) does a great afternoon show (from 2 pm - 7 pm including the rush hour drive home) and there's Andy Frost and Al Joynes too.  My personal favourite though is the DJ on from 7 to midnight during the week, Alex Hindmarch...the guy's got a casual style that is super appealing and entertaining.  Another draw for me...and I think fellow Yelpers might find the appeal in this too...is their theme and "top lists" weekends.  Each weekend of the year tends to have either a theme (this past weekend was "80s music that doesn't suck!") or a countdown (usually reserved for long weekends and feature lists like "Top 107 lead guitarists" or something similar) that is voted for by listeners.  I enjoy both but LOVE the latter...I've been known to go out of my way to make sure I'm available to hear the top 10.  So while I may be a relative newcomer to the station itself, they've got themselves a loyal listener for years to come :)~tea ~5
6zlqcZP2kKpQoE3wmJhunw~jMhjptlbW5oaEPWTz1vNeg~Richard and his team at Property Repair were a delight to deal with. Professional and genuinely friendly - which is an underestimated quality in a trade where you put your faith in the experience and know how of the contractor.    When I needed a quick and very flexible approach to a kitchen expansion Richard reacted both with speed and also understanding that we could not close the kitchen during trading hours. Richard scheduled the work in a logical sequence, suggesting aspects that could be carried out away from site and were then installed after the kitchen closed each day - with minimum impact to trading times.    The work was carried out on time and on budget and after each session the kitchen space was left in a clean and workable condition ready for the next morning.    I'll definitely be using Property Repair again this autumn for the next phase of the expansion project.    Recommended.    Chris Lynch Owner Coffee Angel Limited~coffee ~5
3vlAG8FVYRB9wEIZXFk3ag~sE7VbKBgMT9rh4PMEJoKjw~I love this place!! This is a great place  if you want to hang out with your friends and bring your babies with. It is very spacious and you can take the strollers inside! The chocolate- zucchini cupcakes are sooooooo delicious!!! I also tried the veggie sandwich with goat cheese and it was yummy!! The prices are very reasonable. The owner of the place and the lady who helps  are very friendly and it's very nice to chat with them.Sooooooo I give them 5 stars for their excellent service. I also plan to have my daughter's 1st birthday party there as she loves going there and playing with her friends there. I would highly recommend Playful Grounds.~zucchini cupcakes sandwich cheese ~5
3vlAG8FVYRB9wEIZXFk3ag~3AaKmjQX4T9p_jN-MCjsmw~I came here as part of the indie coffee passport (ICP). There have been some good finds so can't complain much. But like ICP's in the past one runs into spots which are quite bad. This place is such an example. More of an event space with a cafe on the side IMO. Just vile vile stuff here in terms of espresso drinks. Desserts are way over priced (3.50 for mini cup cake that has frosting which belongs in the garbage). I am all for supporting a good cause but this is plain ridiculous. I am sure some management type came up with the idea to turn this place into cafe for revenue generation but instead of charging regular cafe like prices I would say just have a donation box at the counter and have people pay what they feel like here. Here is the verdict Espresso: Mild Crema': Poor Milk: Frothed poorly and not latte art to speak off. This is a very poor attempt at a Cappuccino. You are better off trying a powdered drink IMO. 1 Star.~coffee desserts cake milk: ~1
3vlAG8FVYRB9wEIZXFk3ag~HSejqFFWRPLesM8YlB73vQ~2.5 Stars  Upon entrance of this place I found it to be pretty comfortable. The decor is pretty nice and unique. As I walked further into the cafe, after I ordered, I spotted a little play area for kids. This is quite an interesting thing I have never seen before.  I ordered the Latte and was not overwhelmed. In fact, it underachieved in my opinion. It was ridiculously hot first of all (I am pretty sure it's not supposed to be nearly boiled!) and secondly there was not much punch to the coffee itself. This could be as a result of the Roaster they buy from (Alternative Grounds), but it could also be the barista.  The food selection is quite disappointing as well. Everyone who walked in asked for a food menu (although I don't think a menu is necessary) and were told there was muffins and bagels...that's it. Also the baked goods were frozen and not fresh, which is not great.  The reason this place gets a 2.5 star instead of just 2 is for the creativity of thinking about children by creating a place for them to play at.  My impression is they are having a hard time with business, but I will give them credit for trying something different.  I don't think I will be back here, but it has serious potential.  That's it.~coffee ~2
3vlAG8FVYRB9wEIZXFk3ag~-OMIVY6WAyeD4fgnS5Nl1g~I didn't like it here at all.  First of all, I asked for a brewed coffee (on the menu) and the person working, who I assume was the owner told me that she just ran out and wasn't brewing another pot because she wouldn't sell it all.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  It's brewed coffee.  And also, that's not my problem.  So I ordered a soy latte instead, and it was awful.  I'm not even a coffee snob!  Trust me, this was BAD.     The "play area" is tiny and the floor was filthy.  My kid's scooting leg was black.  They need a gate.  It's not about drinking coffee and not watching your kid, it's about  general safety.  It may be better for an older toddler (like 3 or 4) but my 1 year old just kept trying to crawl into the kitchen area.  Oh, and when I asked for water, the owner rather rudely pointed out that it was "right there" and looked at me like I had 4 heads.  I won't return.~coffee ( coffee. coffee coffee ~2
3vlAG8FVYRB9wEIZXFk3ag~bG6u5RB2h4PEReLNZUJqjw~Out of the 3 baby friendly cafes in Toronto that I know of, this is my favorite. The play area is small and not fenced in and I don't mind at all. In fact, I think it's a smart idea as it's not the staff's responsibility to watch your kids while you chat and eat but the play area is there to make your life easier and your child's visit more pleasant. There is a train table with full tracks and trains, a kitchen with all the dishes and fake food your kids need to "cook" and make believe, a bookshelf packed with books and other various toys. The floor plan is open and quite roomy and the bathrooms are incredibly kid friendly with flip down child toilet seats and lots of stools. There is a kiddy menu that is very reasonably priced and tasty. The food overall is pretty good but simple since there is no full kitchen so the owners do the best they can. There is a liquor license. Oh, and the best vegan cupcakes from Sweets from the Earth that I have ever had I am not vegan. In the Summer there is a small patio and the front doors open up but are blocked by a large leather sofa so kids can't escape.  The owners are the friendliest and most open ladies I have had the pleasure of meeting and this is one of my go to places now when I want to enjoy a tea, lunch or brunch with a friend or group of friends. I actually have even just gone on my own once and my daughter had a great time playing and I got caught up on some work on my ipad while enjoying a coffee and muffin. My daughter likes the grilled cheese or pizza. She didn't even want to leave to go get ice cream! lol! That's the hard part, getting your kids to leave. I really suggest going here if you are looking for a nice relaxing cafe experience that your kids will enjoy too. This is not a kids cafe or an indoor playground. This is a good cafe that caters to adults and makes their lives a little easier by providing entertainment for the kids. This is a community cafe.  If you don't want kids running underfoot or hearing little voices do not bother going here.~cupcakes tea, coffee cheese pizza ice cream! ~4
6sPzXmcj7dCe6ciTV1bd0Q~os7yX8tHn4j6Edb7eTaNow~For years I've been the kind of skint hair chick who uses a different hairdresser each time, looking out for deals and acting as a model often in order to avail of good value options.   When the time came to get a grown up hair consultation, I turned to Medusa (based on great reviews of their colour technicans on other sites) and I've not looked back. My stylist is Kym (who is a Creative Director) and I can't recommend her highly enough. Her  colour expertise and the way she cuts and blow dries my hair is superb, she offers straight up advice and is never pushy with add ons or products. I'm going from black to a much lighter shade in stages, and feel confident with each step we take.   The environment is fresh, friendly and not overly 'hairdressy'. No-one has asked me where I'm going on holiday. I love coming here, they are flexible, friendly, professional and serve coffee, tea by the plenty.   They are very flexible with timecales, which suits me as I'm always running and busy. I've often got an appointment at short notice, and I'm confident they'll do their best to fit me in whenever I call.   The icing on the cake? Coco the mini French Bulldog who sometimes hangs out in the shop. Cute as anything!~coffee, tea cake? ~5
6sPzXmcj7dCe6ciTV1bd0Q~IUq29iLXpT90BmfinObqnQ~This place was excellent. Not only was the stylist totally cool, but worked around my OCD and cut my hair perfectly. I went from an almost shoulder length bob to a very short asymmetrical hair style. It was fantastic. The salon was clean, the coffee was good, they had a fabulous product wall... Really I couldn't be happier.~coffee ~5
-jEWdfyvYOHV4Os85OuorA~wJd2_jSzW65qo2ovfVx58Q~well everyone there is pretty nice i got gel tips from them and i do beat them up pretty bad at work and they are holding up as they should. they were reasonably priced. There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.  PROS: * inexpensive  * good color selection * nice people *television available  CONS: *Some of my tips are longer than others *When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes *whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon) *the language barrier but its no one's fault *the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*  Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).~cherry ~3
-jEWdfyvYOHV4Os85OuorA~2tBlqGzBnSXLfbVas1KgrA~Horrible. Service while there was fine, no complaints. However, after three days my entire gel manicure has turned from light pink/nude to yellow/ brown. I've read this is caused by bad product used. Won't be back!~brown. ~2
7XRbA_t8UNxMHkdslLd5Tw~TFJf4AvqmshlDffKyBuLiA~I have a confession to make my fellow yelpers...  I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good.   The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.  The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol.   But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good.   I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from.   And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare.~bbq pork ~5
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~d45yzd5AauPYl1jtXHd5DQ~I love the banh mi here. Banh Mi can be very difficult to find but here it is Very authentic and cheap. Good quality and flavor. Along with that I always order the Vietnamese iced coffee which is a delight. They make it fresh. It's good food for a great price.~coffee ~5
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~3vxGySOTrgTYrMkl6bpJLQ~I'm going to give this a 5-star for their Avocado Shake! I love, love, LOVE their avocado shake. It's best made when the owner (father looking man) makes them. His kids (well at least I think it's his kids) help out and make the shakes too, but it  just doesn't compare to how he makes them.  I'm not into trying the other shakes because they're not made with real fruits...they use powder mixes...except for the avocados.~avocado avocado ~5
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~v3eWfWAmvX_zlKa5j3wVkw~Terrible boba drinks. Everything uses powder mixes. Even Tea! I have had many boba drink from garden grove,CA to Chandler,AZ. This place isn't even close to their flavors. By the way, I ordered the Thai iced tea, it tasted like water with POWDER Thai tea mix and some milk. It tasted just that: water and powder.~tea! thai tea, thai tea milk. ~1
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~p9ZHf-pi7-JncXbzdIcJGg~I've gotten boba drinks here before, but today was my first day getting a sandwich.  I spent last weekend chowing down on bánh mì in Cali (a shop on every corner) but I hadn't gotten my fix. This did the job :) I got a chicken sandwich and it's stuffed full of veggies! Yummmm. The chicken isn't too bad either.~sandwich. chicken sandwich ~4

7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~rmCEwe68NghttZy8g6X0Zg~We got problems at "Our house." Tactless and  Nickle & Dime you...leaves me bothered and broke  I must admit, I am a little excited to write this review. I had to wait and let myself cool down.  My sister just came back from Cali and while there tried boba tea. I was shocked she has never tried...nevertheless we were on the search for boba tea.  Being from Portland, OR and loving FatStraw on Hawthorn for its boba tea I had somewhat predisposed standards of the the root based little novelty . Little did I know Our House was not operating on the same level...  I had the Strawberry.. Both of my little sisters had Taro.. We all had boba in them   Sister 1 did not like the little boba and wanted to exchanged it for a different drink. My lil sister...barely 11 walked up to the counter and politely asked only to get rejected, she walked back sad, knowing she either dump the drink or power through the drink. I then walked up to the employee and discussed a few business ethics and standards that AZ and USA operate at a normal basis.  With his broken english he refused any refund or exchange transaction....I thought to myself...all this for what... for his poorly made product? Pick and choose your battles.  Sister 2 did not lik the AZ based boba tea store...she wished she was still in Cali. Don't we all.  Me: It cost me just under $4.25 for one drink w/ boba, tack on an additional $.50cents for the fact that I used a debt card!..So i payed 4.75ish for a drink made with powder and NO customer service..~tea. tea. tea taro.. tea ~1
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~G1ZCMhW7Yu4ub13Tn7gagw~I've come here a few times and must of the time it's just a bite under a 3 star. I'm not into the powder mixed drinks. I feel that the drinks come out too sweet and watery.  If I had to base this on the Avocado drink...oh man...I'd add more stars. The avocado drink is from fresh fruit and I was very pleased to see that. It's my favorite flavor thus far and it's probably cuz it's not a powder mix...plus it really does taste like avocado. It's not too sweet...it retains it's true flavor. I'm definitely coming back for this drink...no doubt!~avocado avocado avocado. ~2
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~xpm6bTdziZdJa0eANM8w6w~Waited at the counter for a few good minutes before I was finally acknowledged, (the man was pacing back and forth so I'm positive he knew I was there. Anyway, decided to stop by just because I was already inside grocery shopping. Ordered the avocado boba and again, waited and waited. The whole ordeal was about 20 minutes. Finally got my drink and definitely tasted like some cheap a** artificial stuff. You could tell that they didn't use real avocado. What a waste of money. I feel bad for the people trying boba for the first time at this joint. Please try bomboba! It's in the same plaza by subway.~avocado avocado. ~1
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~BAMcMmN3aCt9Vilu4e3bjA~This is the other restaurant in Lee Lee. I don't know if it's Korean, Vietnamese, or what. They have sushi, banh mi, boba tea, and a cooler case full of kim-chee. It's more of a casual, grab and go type establishment than Hope Kee.  I can't say anything about the quality of their food. But I did grab a thai iced boba tea. YES - two awesome things combined in one drink! Not only that, it was really good.   The lady who made it was so proud of the quality of their boba teas, she insisted that I take a sip before I even left her counter. Then I sucked down the rest before I even got to the end of the block. It was so worth the belly ache.~sushi, tea, thai tea. ~3
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~9aDeyUQAAqCYrr09iyGCkw~This time was not that good. Took forever. Sandwich was very bland not as tasty as I remembered. Maybe different cook :(~sandwich ~2
7mSGmBkDYokjahDSm2aW0A~qGOEpTuRMkP91VPyXQAthQ~I have been in several times. Three times for sushi and three times for the vietnamese sandwiches. I see some lower rating. I rate on service, quality of food, value, how do they make me feel. I have always been treated very well. I am by no way an expert on sushi or vietnamese sandwiches, boba drinks. This is the only place I have ever had a baba drink. All I know is I have always  gotten good service and the food was good. Their boba drinks or the ones I have tired are very drinkable. I don't usually get one because I find them too sweet. If I eat chocolate I like a 99% bar. They have limited seating I think about 4 tables with three chairs at each table. They are set up for the people that are on the go. Order a sandwich, sushi, drink eat it there  or take it with you. The sandwiches are inexpensive, less expensive than eating at one of the fast food places.  I have been there about six times now and will be going back.~sushi sandwiches. sushi sandwiches, sandwich, sushi, sandwiches ~3
52qDpzzMSH3hnQL4oCSQtA~Ha2BeNOCj8Jiu33pBQVMGQ~Communication with customers is an area of opportunity for this USP. Most people do not know standard shipping processes and cost.   They said they could print a pre-paid label from an email. AFTER PRINTING the woman told me it would be 3$. (3$ to print a single black and white piece of paper with a prepaid label on it.)  If I was informed of the cost before printing I would have printed at home.They waived the charge, I was grateful.~white ~2
0g0LbDsPabCHbQN8Za7YpQ~wprpFjJAeWSJNG74hjPybw~This is a really small pub at the top of  Dublin Street, opposite the Stand Comedy Club. It's useful to know about if you are about to see a show at the comedy club, or have just had a busy day shopping at the nearby Harvey Nicols shop. Otherwise, there are better pubs to visit. They have 2 tvs showing sky, but the setting of the pub has a barrier in the middle so only those sitting or standing directly by the tvs can watch them. So this makes the small pub even smaller. When there was a bookies next door a lot of punters would come in and watch the horse racing at the weekends. The bookies has now closed so the pub is usually very quiet. It does have room for 4 tables outside, so if you are lucky to be there on a sunny day, grab one of those. Their food menu is better than you might think. I've had chicken and bacon wrap with fries a couple of times and it's tasty and generous portions. Not much atmosphere there though, so there are better options usually.~chicken bacon fries ~3
0g0LbDsPabCHbQN8Za7YpQ~QRLJ-aJbXdcaDVBUPt7kvg~Not really a remarkable put in any way, it's one of these ones where you never think to go even if it is 3 minutes from your flat. It's a bit, meh when thinking of places to spend your evening..  However, when you get in it seems to be so friendly and pleasant that it's like a Derren Brown mind trick and you want to stay there forever and ever. A warm interior, fairy lights and it's proximity to the centre of town make it a strange treat now and again.~brown ~3
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~nDbJ9iuk1k-P0lFev3hqqw~Super experience , note they now serve alcohol !!    Love the decor and friendly vibe .  Had a super nice guy take my order and recommend great stuff , I ate a pesto bowl and a sandwich with tumeric bread.   Both great.  Also super cheap drinks .  Vanilla Smoothie to finish me off which alcohol was added to as well at my request.  Prices great and food better than some more famous vegan restaurants in the city I've tried .  Highly recommend as a vegan  !! :)~sandwich smoothie ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~-2wgAIauSSnVoO7vXXNREQ~So much deliciousness...luckily we have time!   Vegan places are popping up big time in Montreal, and Propulsion is one not to miss! The sandwiches are out of this world! My favourite is the purple taro sandwich and I chose to have the fig bread, the homemade vegan mayo is incredible and their rice bowls are delicious too!  The ambience is relaxed, the staff is very friendly, they are licensed and I'm told that they make food until pretty late at night, so double win for vegan midnight snacks!  I look forward to coming back to check out the smoothies, the chili and well pretty much everything!~sandwiches taro sandwich fig smoothies, ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~8gkcNGK-F21I_e7BElUqyw~Being a vegan tourist is not easy, as you probably know,  so I was really happy to find this place.  And it was excellent!  The staff were incredibly helpful and sweet.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The iced tea was amazing.  A wonderful compliment to poutine for lunch!    I had the fennel sauce and my partner had the mole. Both were incredibly savoury and the vegetables were perfect.  Each flavor was so distinct and complimented the others nicely.   The zucchini cake with avocado icing was a delicious dessert.    I only wish I could eat here all the time!~tea fennel zucchini cake avocado ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~F9czhkKeJPOetJPAtV9Hgw~Amazing little vegetarian restaurant with delicious, simple food and a really inviting concept. My wife enjoyed the fennel/pumpkin bowl while I indulged in the mole bowl. We split a vanilla smoothie, and ended the meal with the most delicious sweet potato cake topped with maple frosting, and sliced kiwi and mango. To top it off, the owners both front and centre and really really nice guys. We will definitely be back!~smoothie, sweet potato ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~3tjUy_JXTYHyY1JchY8uxA~At this airplane-themed vegan resto you have a choice of either bowls, sandwiches or salads (seasonal, but who really craves a cold salad in -30 weather anyhoo...). My dining companion and I went for bowls - she chose the brown rice with Mexican Mole sauce, marinated tempeh and asparagus/beets. Mine was a quinoa with pumpkin-fennel-cashew purée and grilled zucchini and steamed cauliflower. Both had nice little mache, sprouts and a drizzle of balsamic - a beautiful and well-rounded dish. My only critique would be that the purée wasn't hot (or even warm) and neither were the veggies and the quinoa was only slightly warm. Consistent temperature (either hot or cold) would have been preferable as it was an odd mix. I'll just be sure to request that next time as regardless everything was delicious and clean-the-plate worthy.   The service was very warm and the selection of drinks both alcoholic and non was nice - kombucha, tisanes, coffees, smoothies etc. No room for desert but they had coconut-banana and coconut-mango ice and other sundries that were tempting.   Halfway through our meal we had a lovely surprise where one of the staff started playing the piano...instrumental music - mostly covers ranging from Daft Punk to Bjork to the Mamas and the Papas. A nice touch. Will most definitely return.~sandwiches salads ( salad brown tempeh quinoa pumpkin- fennel- zucchini cauliflower. quinoa smoothies coconut- banana coconut- mango ~4
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~aqERrLMMAbhsvZNt6gf2xw~Every once in awhile I have a meal at a restaurant that exceeds all my expectations, and it happened recently in of all places, Montreal, Canada.  In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads. I hope that people check this place out because it truly is a hidden gem and I hope that I will have the pleasure of many return visits when I travel to Montreal.~french fries ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~anga_jwz3CH5MocXBAfIdw~After a week of being in Montreal and not eating vegan my husband and I were thrilled to discover this place while walking on St. Catherine St. in the Village, a block away from the Beaudry Metro stop.  We had the rice and mole with broccoli and a smoothie.  So happy to have something healthy.  Met the owner and his mother who were delightful.  It just opened a month ago and I hope it is a success.~broccoli smoothie. ~4
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~AWXne_e4MGfd8I6fw-MfKA~After eating at several amazing vegan restaurants in Montreal we didn't think there was anymore room to be impressed but our lunch at Propulsion was amazing!!   We started with a vanilla smoothie and enjoyed every drop! It was very refreshing! My husband ordered the mole maple with brown rice and veg and loved it. I had the pumpkin on barley found it to be very satisfying and tasty. I'm glad I added the extra tempeh. The smokey flavour really worked with the rest of the dish. We finished off our meal by sharing a piece of sweet potato cake topped with maple sauce and fresh fruit. It was mind blowingly delicious! These guys haven't been open for long but have created something great! I do hope they do well so we have a chance to go back on our next visit.~smoothie brown pumpkin barley tempeh. sweet potato ~4
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~aT3tGTWPHM02UOKSkz0MOQ~This small sandwich shop is well located and food is O.K. The sandwich that I had was fine. Nothing memorable, but decent. Many items were not ready when I went there for lunch. Hopefully next time when I visit I would have the chance to try more items from the menu.~sandwich sandwich ~3
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~SaR9ToVUvyiFdy_wVw1H3w~Went there for a late night lite meal.Great meal, entertaining staff who were exceptionally friendly. Fresh ingredients, good smoothies. Delicious pesto! Perfect for light vegetarian fare.~smoothies. ~5
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~ejbGWhqcBWe6BF5h60uvtg~La déco vaut vraiment le détour ! Même si dans l'assiette et le service, la présentation fait un peu plus cheap : on est assurément dans une cantine.  On regrette simplement que les savoureux sandwiches ne permettent pas d'apprécier davantage les produits (mungo mango par exemple). Pour les desserts, le gâteau avec glaçage à l'érable est un régal !  Le prix modéré et la terrasse bien placée sur la rue Ste-Catherine en font néanmoins une très bonne adresse pour les végétaliens et autres omnivores moins fortunés, de passage à Montréal, sans en attendre autant que La Panthère Verte (3 adresses en ville...) ou Crudessence (...mais c'est une autre histoire !).~sandwiches mango desserts, ~3
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~C-uhElq5tzNov6rkDTxmjQ~Qu'on ne se laisse pas avoir par le mot "Cantine", ici on est bien loin des patates frites grasses et des hot dogs relish moutarde salade de chou. Le concept est intéressant; On propose un menu interactif (et extrêmement abordable, les prix n'allant pas plus haut que 15$ pour un plat) où l'on peut créer à l'aide d'une liste d'ingrédients originaux son sandwich, sa salade, son bol-santé et même son dessert! Et qu'on ne s'imagine pas un comptoir à la Subway; tout est préparé à partir d'aliments frais et bio dans la cuisine pour ensuite vous être livré dans un bol genre "petit cul-de-poule" ou "gamelle à chien", dépendamment de vos références de vie. Ça fait pas de très belles présentations, mais ça fait parti du thème j'imagine. Un clin d'oeil au chutney de poivre rouge, j'en aurais acheté un pot à ramener chez moi si j'avais pu. Mais Propulsion, c'est plus que de la nourriture, le gars avait une idée encore plus poussée derrière tout ça. Voulant donner un aspect théâtral au souper de ses clients, on peut donc jouir de la présence d'un pianiste qui se donne en spectacle les vendredis et samedi durant toute l'heure du souper. Ça, en plus du décors style rétro sous le thème de l'aviation (Le bar est en fait une réplique d'aile d'avion!), ça vient créer une ambiance vraiment agréable et qui sors de l'ordinaire. Par contre, je cherche encore le rapport avec la nourriture végétalienne et les avions... Et soulignons la serveuse qui fut d'une rapidité exemplaire, je veux dire, pour un souper d'ouverture et un restaurant à presque pleine capacité, j'ai vraiment été impressionnée par son travail.   En tant que nouveau restaurant végétalien (ça pousse cette année à Montréal non?), ils ont réussi à se démarquer grace à leur concept original. Est-ce que ça va être assez pour les faire survivre à la forte compétition qui commence à s'établir dans le milieu? Je leur souhaite! Mais ce qui est sur c'est qu'ils valent le détour, autant pour un lunch on the go, un souper entre amis ou un healthy craving à 4h du matin! (Un resto végétalien ouvert jusqu'à 5am les vendredis et samedis? Yé!)~hot dogs sandwich, ~4
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~dmLKeI4vAn3Uyw8AiZx5dw~On a trip to Montreal, most people will recommend that you check out the city's culinary scene in some way, shape or form. That's no simple task when you're a nut-allergic vegan dating someone who's gluten free and lactose intolerant.  So the fact that this place was a five minute walk from our hostel off Ste-Catherine was a godsend. Do not be alarmed by the pilot-dressed manikin in the window (which is kinda creepy) or the questionable stability of the upcycled plane wings as tables (which are still extremely rad). The food and service at this place were really exemplary.  I can't remember the last time I felt so physically healthy and still deeply satisfied after leaving a restaurant.   The miso plate I got was excellent and the complimentary smoothies that we received the first time around were so good that we went back to have them as meal on their own before our return journey to the states. The owner was really friendly and he even switched out my complimentary smoothie for another after he learned about my nut allergy.   Food was delicious and I stress that even if you don't have a restricted diet, if you just want to feel good and energized after a meal while still enjoying a culinary experience, this place is worth checking out.~miso smoothies smoothie ~4
7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw~d77W2fPGPU3ry9aqWkU4YQ~Such a relaxing, calm place with delicious, healthy food. The people who work there are friendly, too. You don't need to be a vegan or vegetarian to enjoy it. I loved the quinoa bowls and also the mango mung bean sandwich. I went here a few times during my vacation in Montreal because it's one of the few healthy options in this area.~quinoa mango sandwich. ~5
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~PI3YRfJ6MIiN3zHPkrfD3Q~I used to work in this area and would have LOVED to hang at this place, but only visited for the first time last night post-Elite event. The staff was so friendly and accommodating and we were a large group! Local 4 just had a nice, relaxed vibe, 10 good taps (including Pear Cider YUM!) and the few bites of food I tried (thanks Christine and Dennis) were very tasty. I would definitely go back. I bet the front patio gets crowded in the summer, but I'll chance it.~pear ~5
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~KTtrTRl8kcimbOPGKNYDPg~Everything at Local 4 was good, but not great! The burger was good and I had a Blanche de Chambly which is a good beer, at a good price, served by a good server... you get the point. Nothing really stood out!  I would be happy to go back, but wouldn't out of my way to do so.~burger ~3
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~ApanqASx2xsCnrdICVjVOg~Went here today (Friday evening) to use a coupon my friend bought on www.groupon.com. Needless to say we got a really good deal :)  Place was pretty nice. Food good, service GREAT and nice decor. Overall I would say it's nothing that will blow your mind but it's still better than average! They have a nice patio out front too.  We tried the butternut squash cakes for an appetizer, and split 2 mains - a sundried tomato with pesto pizza and the Local 4 falafel.  The falafel was delish, the butternut squash cakes too. Pizza was mediocre.   Note that the food is slightly more expensive than posted on the online menu - they need to get that updated but it seems to be about 10% higher now.  Our server was absolutely great, made food recommendations and was attentive and funny too.  I'd go back for drinks for sure, wouldn't go out of my way to return for the food, but if you happen to be there - the food is good.~butternut tomato pizza butternut pizza ~4
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~R8h8C-xjacWe42a1fJxLXg~cozy place right off of Yonge street. Not enough staff but sufficed for when I was there. Great steak and their Long Islands were probably one of the best I've ever had. I'll be going back again for sure~steak ~3
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~gSf8WXM6xcaRrubtddN07A~Let's be clear: this place is horrible.  I'll cut to the chase, because its unforgivable. We ordered a couple apps and a couple cocktails. As I was eating a sweet potato won-ton, I bit into a large chunk of dirty plastic that had obviously come from piece of machinery used to prepare these over-fried pieces of tasteless, greasy cardboard (on a side note, it was served with some sort of "spicy Thai" sauce, which is really a scoop from some giant vat of mass produced combination of soy sauce, fake ginger, and MSG).   When I told the server with a shocked face, he seemed so indifferent and complacent that it was almost some sort of a normal occurrence to him. "Oh, okay," as he took the plate away without any question. I asked for the bill immediately, and when he returned with it later, he told me he had removed the offending item so that we wouldn't be charged.  Listen... I just chomped down on a piece of machinery and it hurt. Don't think you're being some generous prince by knocking the thing off the bill. I gave him less money than the total -- basically enough to cover the drinks -- and told him that's all he was getting. Again, no reaction.  Here's where I tell you that the menu sucks; the crab cakes taste like they came from MM Meatshop; the stale olives in the martini tasted like aluminium. The only saving grace was the readily available boxes of Trivial Pursuit cards, which quickly lost their novelty.  This is what concerns me most: we came here because people on Yelp said it was decent. Trust us, and just walk a few doors down to Volo instead. They're pricks, but at least they have great beer.~sweet potato ~1
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~0RoMrVo95H_Uh3dyLAkftw~Not to be confused with Four Loko,  Local 4 is a cozy little resto pub that is an adorable little refuge away from the sketch and stank of the Yonge street strip, and funny enough right next to Kawaii Spa, wink-wink ;) Incidentaly according to their website Local 4 does happen to serve absinthe martinis, alcoholic debauchery notwithstanding I am here for a simple evening of dining with some lovely Yelp ladies.  I arrive late to meet with lovely ladies Chris P and Elaine K as they are conveniently seated at the very first table which is seperated from the entrance by a large glass pane. The  atmosphere is intimate and laid back as they had a little fireplace going completely decked out in tinsel and Christmas regalia.    The menu is a concise offering of delectable comfort foods.  I order the Butternut squash cakes to share which is 3 pieces, Panko Breaded with Corn and Red Peppers, served with sour Cream spiked with scotch bonnet peppers. The cakes are delightfully crisp and savoury and nicely complimented by the tangy vinagrette marinated cucumber strings.  The ladies order their respective meals and I order the Green salad with poppy seed dressing topped with grilled chicken and I have to declare it is the best salad I have had in a long time as the warm chicken along with the fresh greens and flavourful poppy seed dressing is a medley of deliciousness happening in my mouth.  The meal was actually pretty reasonably priced as the total for 1app a big salad and two entrees came to about $56!  Kudos and thanks to the lovely Chris P for choosing such a great cozy spot for a lazy rainy Monday dinner get-together. I highly recommend Local 4 for that perfect little place to escape for a pint, some good food and good conversation.~butternut corn sour cream cucumber salad chicken salad chicken greens salad ~4
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~Dp9qH9UrxFMRbBQiSEmxYA~I came in here to use my groupon as well and one big thing after ordering quesadillas and falafel (which should normally are not items that take long to prep) was the time the food took to actually come to our table, and we were one of 2 tables that were occupied. For having to be somewhere after dinner, the chunk of time the overall experience of dining here took really took away from the fact that the food was really good.   However slow speed is not the only reason local 4 receives 3 stars, the overall atmosphere in here is not really my thing, with plain tables and chairs and nothing spectacular done. It's a simple bar, friendly staff and I know if I lived around the area, local 4 would be my go to place for drinks and good food. But since I don't, while the beer selection is OK and the food is great, I doubt I will come here often. It is definitely worth repeat visits though. The menu is a little on the pricey side as well, but at least the food is good.  The falafel was possibly the best I've had and the chicken quesadilla is also great. You add free board games in to the mix and this is a place that everyone definitely needs to visit for a not too fancy exprience.   But lower prices and faster service is a definite must for a better experience.~quesadillas chicken ~3
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~JXdAz1CUYPfMpldCKAZhJQ~Another restaurant that doesn't know what it is. You can be a quaint, low key, comfort food joint, but that means low prices and leave words like "Frites" for the pro's. You serve fries.   18 dollar meals in a greasy spoon diner, with low lighting.   Groupon saved me $$$ but i wouldn't come back.~fries. ~2
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~iLUjnweK7S28tNFVdwAwIA~Local 4 is a delightful little pub just off the beaten path.  They serve top-notch pub fare alongside some quality beers (but needs to be more seasonal, lagers and pale ales just don't satisfy in the dead of winter and they were out of the oatmeal stout. nb: Guinness in a can doesn't count as stout, or a beer for that matter) and just happened to fit my craving for comfort food on a really cold night perfectly.  I had a wonderful meal starting with their delicious butternut squash crab cakes, which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli that had no scotch bonnet in it.  While it was a puzzling omission, it was a lovely starter. For my supremely comfortable entree, I had the beef bourguignon, which was a hearty stew of button mushrooms, thick-cut carrots, cippolini onions and tender chunks of beef with what the chef likes to call "pear mashed potatoes".  This blew me away when it was served, and I thought it was unique, clever and bloody delicious. They take a heaping mound of mashed and shape it like a giant pear, and then quickly deep fry it, and top it with a whole clove as the stem. I had to smile and marvel at its elegant construction before I hungrily devoured my plate. I splurged on some sticky toffee pudding for dessert as the meal was so perfectly hitting all of my gastrogenous zones, and it did not disappoint. It was a large piece and while they were a bit light on the caramel sauce, my waistline didn't need any more abuse on this particular occasion. Everything was perfect, and it was just what I needed on a windy and oh-so-cold night.   The atmosphere and decor are wonderful, it feels really comfortable and homey in there. Also, the music deserves some kudos, they were playing some bad-ass underground hip hop when we got there which transitioned to the entire Led Zeppelin's Early Days album.  Service was fantastic, however, we were one of 2 tables when we arrived, so I would expect fairly undivided attention.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable and ensured that I will certainly consider Local 4 again in the future.  The prices are reasonable given the high quality of the food, and if my only complaint is a lack of beer menu, that's a forgivable sin and a common gripe of mine.  Check out the Local 4 next time you need a great pub and plant some pears for your heirs!~butternut beef mushrooms, beef pear potatoes" pear, caramel ~4
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~3g6poNP1D3lxTbNv4_72aA~Like most places I go to, I've only ever had drinks here. The place is a nice little spot on a side road near Wellesley. The tiny patio is great in the summer. If you go, you have to order the Absintini! All of the food on the menu seemed like it was very well-priced. $15 average for a main dish. Good low-key hang out place and great date spot.~date ~4
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~HXWA4q4g0G8-H67KTkEw8Q~I went to Local 4 last night with my boyfriend and could not have been more disappointed. First of all, it was August and it had rained, so we opted to sit inside. The a/c wasn't turned on, so it was hot and muggy despite the ceiling fans. They proceeded to turn on the a/c which couldn't possibly have been working because we were still sweating.   We ordered the sweet potato fries ($8) and the artichoke dip ($9) as appetizers. First of all, for the price of the appetizers, we were expecting A LOT more than a small plate of fries and a ramekin of dip. The "crostini" that came with the dip was inedible...literally. They were burnt and rock hard that they were impossible to bite into. I asked for some pita bread instead which was softer, but had been "grilled" which gave it a burnt taste - likely the result of a grill that is not cleaned very often. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and were served with a watery chipotle mayo (great flavour, but thin consistency.)  For entrees I ordered the falafel which is touted on the menu as being the "best in the city" and for $13, I had pretty high expectations. Let me just say that for $5.99 I could've had TWO falafels, double the size, just down the street. and i'm sure they would've been much better tasting.   My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I liked the fries, but he said the sandwich was only okay.  Overall, the food barely deserves even one star. It's over-priced and borderline inedible. The atmosphere is lacking...not much to it, but not in a new-age minimalist way. I would describe it as drab. I WILL say that the service was friendly and I also have to mention that I did like the plates they use (straight out of the '70's).~sweet potato ~1
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~CGkUK87501c33LSB36XjOQ~Your friendly neighborhood pub!  Pubs with boardgames are awesome.  This place is super laid back and the wait staff are quite friendly.  The decor is casual and they have a nice selection of beers.  I like lighter fruitier beers, so options such as pear cider and apricot wheat beer are great.  For an average looking pub, I was surprised by their menu.  Butternut squash cakes, sweet potato wontons... not your usual pub fare.  I wanted to order the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad, but the special sounded too delicious.  It was a jerk chicken sandwich with avocado salsa with an arugula salad with strawberries, almonds, and poppy seed dressing.    The chicken was tasty... not sure if it was really jerk chicken...but I'm from Scarborough, so I'm a bit picky when it comes to jerk chicken.  (Brup brup). The salsa had large fresh chunks of avocado.  The flourless chocolate cake had a wonderful smooth texture.  It wasn't too heavy and moist.  The slice was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was still quite good.  I would come back here for a casual meal and a pint.~pear apricot wheat butternut sweet potato ~3
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~iO0y2qUx0QWz99dX-BIdHA~Hi there. I'm writing to complain about a situation today on the patio. I was the first to be seated close to 3pm and ordered a delicious braised lamb shank. As my plate arrived, another patron on the patio lit up a cigar. When I mentioned his smoking, he simply moved to another table. Nothing was said or done by the staff in order to alleviate my concerns. My otherwise lovely meal was spoiled by cigar smoke. I nearly threw up from it. To compound things, his friend arrived and both of them were smoking cigars. I know it's not a fully covered patio, but there is something called common sense, that when you're serving food, diners shouldn't have to worry about retching from heavy smoke.~lamb ~1
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~0WmjjVXoa9jc35RHJbgl9Q~My partner and I were in the area, and we're not huge fans of the snarky service at Volo, but wanted to sit at a patio, so we ventured down Dundonald a bit to Local 4.   I had a mcauslan apricot ale, which is always delicious on tap and my partner had mill st. lemon tea ale, which we had never tried before and was really refreshing.   the food took awhile, although we were not too concerned as it was a beautiful afternoon. however, when it arrived the server explained that our meals had taken longer because the batter on my chicken fingers hadn't turned out quite the way the cook had wanted and she re-made them. it was definitely worth the wait! i've never had chicken fingers with such a crunchy, melt-in-your-mouth batter. my partner had the pulled pork, which he claimed was the best he's ever tasted (apart from his own, of course).   the atmosphere is very relaxing and the service is friendly! check it out!~apricot lemon tea chicken fingers chicken fingers pulled pork ~4
DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg~d_v2L_5900Ze6Tj76ndhGw~I think the place is a 2, but it gets bonus points for cozyness and a great place to hold a private party and/or have drinks. (re: Elite party was great!)  As a restaurants, I wouldn't recommend it.  We used a $40 Groupon today, but still had to pay $30 (for 2 people) in addition!   The food is quite expensive ($14-18) a plate, but mainly comfort food, nothing spectacular.  We got the butternut squash crab cakes ($9), it has 3 and comes with a house made mayo. It was very good, mostly due to the panko crust.  For the main, I got the 4 cheese mac and cheese and was disappointed.  the 4 cheese included - shaved parm on top, some dried melted cheese on top, and a creamy cheesy sauce.  I wasn't impressed. ($14) It was also a penne, and I hate the generic penne.  My friends got the chicken pot pie, and the meatloaf sandwich.   They have a great beer and drink selection.  As for ciders, they only Strongbow.   They do have boardgames, but they were not well maintained, peices missing, crusty.   The service was good, and they did come by frequently. I was disappointed when I asked about the different things on the menu he couldn't give much description. But they were very attentive.  Overall - drinks, and apps. Not much more.~butternut cheese mac and cheese ~3
AAxn6jh7zzMk99TMyWgGkQ~ixW7JqFMpccphwymfMIB9A~Mmmm--me likey!    I found this on Yelp and was glad to find a BBQ place so close to my daughter's apartment I'm visiting.  I was the designated child care for my new step-granddaughter this afternoon so I said, "Hey, let's go out to lunch!"  We headed for Andrew's 2nd location on Southern near Dobson.  First impression--specious, clean, bright, cheerful.    The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs (she only ate two, though she liked them, just eats like a bird), huge pile of excellent fries, and drink of choice (chocolate milk). The mini corn dogs were fixed really well, deep fried like little fritters, crunchy and crisp.  I got a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun with one side (cole slaw) also for $5.  The pork was tender and non-greasy, had wonderful mild flavor, and the BBQ sauce, which you pump as much as you want out of a big jug, had great flavor.  There was a spicier version available if you preferred. Cole slaw was very good--I forgot to ask if it was homemade by them but it tasted like it could be.  The girl behind the counter was very cheerful and didn't rush me in choosing.  She said she usually works at the Guadalupe location but I'm glad she was here today.    As we sat and ate a leisurely  lunch I looked around and started noticing all the rock and roll posters and even album covers that seemed to be from the 70's and 80's, maybe a couple of 60's.   That added kind of a unique touch to the place.  If I lived in this area, I would definitely be frequenting this place!~corn fries, milk) corn pulled pork ~4
AAxn6jh7zzMk99TMyWgGkQ~DxVQhm7-L6Qz1M5q8l1pFQ~I went here today for lunch, with my 3 kids.  The kids meal prices were steep I thought at 5 bucks, but like the yelper below me stated, you get plenty of food, and I actually only bought two kids meals for my 3 kids, and they didn't even finish them, they were so full.  The kids thought it was great, I got the bbq slider and chicken strips for the kiddos.  I didn't go for bbq, I was going to, but then I noticed that they had a bacon wrapped deep fried dog with coleslaw on the menu.  I love coleslaw, and have never tried a dog made like that, so I had to give it a try.  The bread was nothing to hooo hawww about, but dog was fantastic, and the coleslaw is great!  What a good combo!  I will go back to order there family meal, which sounds like a great deal!  It would be better if they had more sides, but on the other hand, when a place only has a few things to choose from, those few things are usually great!  I also noticed on the menu were fried pickles, not my cup of tea, but I know they are popular in the midwest, and they also had deep fried cheese curds!  I thought the decor was great, very relaxing, yes it was a little bit "head shopish" but, it's not over bearing, and I thought it was unique.  I don't go to eat somewhere for the decor anyway, I go for the good food!~chicken bacon coleslaw coleslaw, coleslaw fried pickles ~5
AAxn6jh7zzMk99TMyWgGkQ~jCz5_BCoTQ99bIOXxDHmVQ~OMG! A new BBQ place in my hood!  hoot!    Ok, so I was driving around running errands today, and wanted to do something different.  As I was driving down Southern, I saw that this place just opened this week!  I guess they have one other location in Tempe, and this is their new place.    Anyways, aside from being family owned, its actually pretty good food.  I got the BBQ brisket sandwich on a bun and it was really really good.  I will probably return in the future for more.   BUT, theres a few things that I noticed while I was here.  Please see below:  Ok, first the menu is mediocure. I mean, theres the usual to choose from...BBQ brisket, chicken and pork.  Prices are fair and they state that they have lunch specials every day including Saturday and Sunday.  But, the sides sucked! I ended up not getting anything on the side.   All they had was redskin potato salad and NO mased potatos.  Also, they had 2 kinds of beans and coleslaw...and that was it.  I was kinda dissapointed.  No mashed potatos?  No corn?  ugh!  none!    Ok, and I admit, Im not Martha Stewart (I know you thought I was, but I'm clearing the air on this once and for all that I'm not) but the place looks like it was decorated by a pothead!  Full fledged pothead! Its like cheba hut meets BBQ in this joint!  (no pun intended!)  WTF gives?  I've never been to a BBQ place and seen a life sized Ozzy Ozborne poster hanging on the wall! Its beyond strange!  OMG!  I just couldn't get past the really odd decor! I mean, it was so weird that I actually deducted a star because it was so out of sorts.  Even though the food here was great, and I will be returning, it was oddly decorated.~sandwich chicken pork. potato salad ~3
AAxn6jh7zzMk99TMyWgGkQ~4Y4W1vR8Eb-MtzSGBhFZhQ~I recently underwent a BBQ metamorphosis. I hated it for as long as I can remember, mainly because I don't like to eat things that make my hands dirty. (As if you don't have your own hang-ups. Sheesh.) Then I discovered ribs.  I recently visited Andrews on my tour of local BBQ eateries. The food is ok but not outstanding, but I'm not impressed with the value.  A full rack of ribs is $20, which is only a dollar less than at Famous Dave's and comes with only one side and a stale white bread dinner roll. The flavor of the meat was good though it was too charred for my liking, as if they hadn't been selling enough to keep them from overcooking (no surprise). But if I'm going to pay Famous Dave's prices, I want a plate and no styrofoam.  The sides weren't memorable, but the building certainly was. It looks like an Arby's that two pre-teens repainted with a couple of cans of barn red, black, and teal paint. Someone obviously put no effort into trying to make this location clean, comfortable, or appealing, so I get why it was empty at 7pm on a Friday night. If Andrew wants to survive in this not-so-great location, he's going to have to up his game.~ribs. ribs white ~2
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~Em8YYnT82Xu7RA_swLoGOw~Had fish and chips for the first time here. Food was delicious but it didn't WOW me like everyone said it would. Good experience though :)~chips ~4
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~51o20XfFup8a9s8PXGceVw~I'm no fish and chip expert but I had the halibut and it was good! The fries were excellent. Not a huge difference in taste between the $8 haddock and the $12 halibut but to each his own. I didn't like the mushy peas but I've never had mushy peas before so maybe I just don't like mushy peas. Friendly staff but I've got to say, the only thing Scottish in the Tartan is the bagpipes on the wall.~fries peas peas peas. ~3
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~Fs22wLOjIroszAV1wWSKJw~Love this place, had been going for a few years when I was living there.  Every time I'm in Oakville will pay this place a visit. The owners are very friendly too.  The Halibut and Chips are the best! The fish is usually fried (yummy!!) in tempura batter and is very fresh.   I've tried all the other chippies (UK slang: Fish & Chip Shop's). This is the best Oakville has!~chips tempura ~4
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~d_Q3RZ7qYXcQ_bmH_fzGyQ~Totally unexpected, the fish and chips was fried well and moist.  The decor was a bit dated and fact it was run by Chinese people threw me off a bit but the food totally made up for it~chips ~5
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~CAUTkT8LQDYQktALCv1aPA~I stumbled upon this place while I was in Oakville. Upon entering the decor is quite dated but that doesn't speak for the quality of the food.  I ordered the Halibut and Chips and I was very satisfied with the taste and quantity of the meal; probably safe to say it has been the best fish and chips I've had to date. They do have other offerings such as scallops, shrimps, and homemade Chicken fingers (which I plan to try next). Service is also quite good; pretty much at par with other fish and chips places I've been to. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great fish place to eat at in Oakville.  I paid $15.05 for my meal, but there is a sign saying prices will be going up.~chips chips date. shrimps, chicken fingers ( chips ~5
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~ZLfYoD2sstIy81cABjQhZg~The staff were super-friendly (and accommodating as I kept changing my order as I saw more and more items on the menu that I wanted). They have the standard fish and chips (haddock, halibut, etc.), and then some other items, such as spring rolls (vegetarian). The fish and chips were generous portions, but I just wish it wasn't so oily and greasy. I have a compromised sense of smell/taste, so it might not be this way for everyone, but it felt like there was a film on the inside of my mouth when I was finished. Still, that's standard with fish and chips, so I wouldn't hold it against this restaurant.~chips ( chips chips, ~4
FSTnet5qh_Tmxu1GtTk3LA~oqHiKdkAKA0RwhFH1MRvCw~Delicious Scottish Fare. Excellent fish and chips, some of the best I've ever had. Like another reviewer, I didn't taste or see much difference between the Haddock (about $8.00) and the Halibut (about $12.00) - I'll get the Haddock from now on because it's much cheaper, and it's pretty much the same portion. You receive 2 packets of tarter sauce, and can purchase more for $.5 each, and if you love tarter sauce like me, you'll need it.   The chips are delicious, and it's all a generous portion. It only took about 10 minutes for them to get our order to us, which was to go. You can sit in, and the space is warm and comfortable, and they make it very evident that this is supposed to be a Scottish establishment.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for excellent Scottish fare. They even sell fish fingers! Now all they need is the custard to go with them.~chips, chips ~4
1OX9AggXkC9tlijv0zgcog~ine_aIs8FNDkAUHp-r7dtg~Purchased this package as a part of a bachelorette party. I'd say the best thing about this package is the convenience of having activities planned and scheduled for a large group as everyone can purchase their package online and pay on their own. It's much easier than having to book each individual activity on your own.   We started off our day with the Pole Dancing Class, followed by Thunder Down Under, then went clubbing at Light afterwards.   Pole Dancing Class - We had a lot of fun with this class. The location is at a Pole Fitness Studio so the room was nice. However, we were unaware that the class was very very booked and each girl had to share a pole with 1 other person. In the end, the instructor was a good sport and taught the class in a way that allowed each person to practice moves 2 times. It may not have been communicated that the class was shared, but in the end we had fun and I liked my gift bag. The T-shirt and panties were very very comfy and I event wore them the next day.   Thunder Down Under - At $30 a ticket, this was a pretty good deal. For the TDU tickets, we picked them up after the Pole Dance class at Excalibur. I thought we got a really good deal for the tickets since we were front and center, so our bachelorette got a lot of attention. Seats at the show are very very cramped, but this doesn't factor into my rating since it's something Night School 4 Girls can't control. Just a tip to be aware of :)   Nightclub Passes - While picking up the tickets for TDU we tried to get the nightclub passes at the same time but we told to come back right before the TDU show to get them. So before the show we went and got our passes which were in enveloped. We got a  - wristband for Marquee & Tao  - A VIP pass for The Bank  - A VIP pass for 1OAK - A VIP pass for Chateau at Paris  - A VIP pass for Light at Mandalay Bay - A VIP pass for LAX at Luxor  - a few other things like show passes and and vouchers for drinks at other places  We opted to go to Light since it's close to Excalibur. When we got to Light around 10:30. We showed our passes to one of the people who was managing the line and that person told us to wait in the regular GA line since they didn't recognize the pass.   I took the pass to show it to a promoter who was helping people in. He didn't recognize it either, and neither did anyone at the front entrance of the club. One of the staff told me they didn't recognize the pass and that it wasn't valid at all. At this point everyone in our group was feeling dismayed since it was a bachelorette party and we were surprised to find out that the "VIP" on the card didn't really mean anything.   We stood in line for awhile and I decided to text the promoter listed on the sheet of paper that was included in our envelope and listed as the contact for Light. There was no response, so I figured that the passes were basically useless and we would just have to get in on our own. We eventually found a promoter who pushed us to the front of the line and got us in. We then tried using the passes for the 2 free drinks they were listed for but no one in the club recognized them.   Seeing as we were invoiced for $33 each for all of the passes on our bill we really questioned the validity of the passes. In the end, I would just opt out of this line item and save yourself the stress and find a good promoter.~sport ~2
1OX9AggXkC9tlijv0zgcog~A3-KyS6PjpjT-UYHYMVTpw~There were SO many people shoved into the room that we barely had any room to move around.  We also had to go in 3 groups for using the pole, so we only learned 3 or 4 pole moves.  The gift bags were fun, but the shirts were one size fits all and we had girls in our group from small to XL, so not everyone ended up with a shirt that fit.  Also, the boas seemed like they bought a regular length boa and cut it in half, I've never seen such a short boa before.  There were some funny moments throughout the class and the instructor was nice and also entertaining, but I didn't learn much and my friends and I were left somewhat dissatisfied.  I bought some night club passes and specified the date as a Sunday because we could only go Sunday or Monday.  When we got the night club passes, they did not match what they say we would get on the website. There were only 2 options for Sunday.   I called one of the clubs that NS4Gs website said we would get a free drink from and the club said no, we would not get a free drink and if we wanted to use the passes (to get in), we should show up no later than 10:30.  Also, there were no monday options.   I emailed them about it and they responded once, when I replied back, they never replied back to me.  So, basically the night club passes were a complete waste of money for us because we didn't get to use them at all and their website is kind of misleading because they don't list any day/time restrictions (I didn't see any at least).  I guess I should have called ahead and confirmed that what the website says is correct and that there were options for the days that we wanted to use them.  Only real positive was that we got front row seating for the Thunder show - which was hilarious and a lot of fun.    I personally would not do this again.~date ~1
7jQxs8gGX7tJjYj8eoBkfA~rTE_5f6epHB-hb9TMPO4XA~As far as an Urban park goes, I will give this place 4 stars. They have a splash pad for kids, and there are lots of benches to sit on. If you live in CityPlace, this is a great place to relax in the spring, summer, and fall. Bring your favourite beverage, sit down and listen to your apple or android device. Great place to people and dog watch!~apple ~4
3Z3EMzYlOdKtdxQOvwMtPQ~iNw7HTCLD5dXLbnLvWAXcg~This is the most ridiculous outfit of 'workers' I've ever encountered. They're on my roof as I type and though debris from the roof is now falling onto my carpet and furniture I'm informed that they CAN'T stop. I've actually called the police after begging them to stop until we can find a solution to the problem I left an emergency message for the roofing company owner, Craig Hollingsworth who arrived at my home within 15 minutes claiming that this amount of residue INSIDE the home is normal and will vacuum right up. Off of a white sofa? Off of beige carpet?  I'm NOT the only one who has complaints about this company here in this community regarding the shabby work being done and damages accompanying it. I recommend that you use ANY other company for roofing than this one. Again, it's Hollingsworth Roofers - (704) 567-2107. Next stop, the Better Business Bureau.~white ~1
3EjcQBo6wGAGBBcCfM5_WQ~F35LjG2YN9mpJS2eVhydqg~Solid 3.5.   Guy behind Invoice counter actually knew of what we spoke of today. Smack my buns with butter and call it a day.   Then get this: This dude even knew where to pick the item up from the Yard. I believe he's Adam. He didn't give himself enough credit to know what we were looking for has escaped at least 10 ten on six occasions and no one in the yard ever knows where they are.   The drawback of all Menards: each floor plan is distinctively different and the variables of fun will be inevitable (this is a farce people please hear my sarcasm). I would think retail knows (or at least WalMart gets it and I hate that place) all floor plans should mimic each other to the point of sad blatant replication, duplication that Stepford Wives will never hold a candle to the floorplan. Not because I'm a slow American too lazy to read. Not because their staff doesn't know what I'm looking for. These things can happen at any retail location once folks are conditioned. BUT BECAUSE TIME IS MONEY AND YOU DELIVER GOODS TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE TO JUGGLE TIME, MONEY AND CUSTOMER DEMANDS TO BUILD THE PERFECT PLACE.   This location is a solid 3.75.  Service at the Invoice Counter: Impressive because others missed the mark but it is what it should be so 4.

CR1sV3ICjh5J15kOeVLJCg~IgO_FoSYRFuYhKp8fPO2WQ~This place is a dive. Which is great if you're in the mood for a dive.  The staff is very friendly, but they're slow. The food is pretty gross, to be honest. Do not go there to eat. If you do, stick to something simple like fries.  Do NOT drink Draught beer there. It's usually flat and not tasty at all. Stick to bottles.  The TVs there suck, don't bother going to watch sports.  The only thing good about this place is the patio. It's right in the annex, has a decent size, and is close to parking and subway.~fries. ~1
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~8e5MtCqa4IC-75yJaRlpUQ~Lovely restaurant--great food and wonderful service.  We brought our two kids aged 5 and 7, and I wouldn't recommend that if your kids are picky eaters.  Ours are, and total meltdown was only averted by the wonderful attentions of the handsome waiter who brought my 5 year old daughter unadorned cheese curds.  The children were graciously welcomed and treated extremely well, but unless yours are adventurous eaters, you'll need to feed them elsewhere.~cheese ~3
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~KBFmFlU8LcRiy3CjSkZ2nA~They had these amazing appetizers, very unique, there was one in particular that stood out -- it had a hint of licorice. ...  I think it was cheese mixed with something else and licorice. I have no idea, but it was so good.  I attended a private event here, and they served random appetizers. They weren't normal ones either, they were creative with their ingredients. I haven't eaten their main courses, I wonder if they'd be any good...  The atmosphere was okay, the music wasn't memorably hip shaking...~appetizers, cheese appetizers. ~3
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~mr0H_WISS8p9q0l3SoRg3A~Décidemment, le Vieux-Montréal n'est plus ce qu'il était, et c'est tant mieux. A des mille des anciennes trappes a touriste, on sent un renouveau en restauration qui respecte les clients et ou l'on rejette les cartes hors de prix de qualité douteuse.  Grange Vin et Bouffe, fait partie de ces établissements. J'ai eut le plaisir de goûter leur tartare ainsi que le Mac&Cheese et c'était très bien. La belle carte de vin avec un beau choix aux verres (quoique restreint) rehausse définitivement l'expérience. Finalement les desserts sont de véritables douceurs pour le palais (le pot de crême au caramel salé.... mmm...) Le service est discret mais efficace.~desserts caramel ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~DDnk16Qy2mEsaHOfUl3iLw~Honestly with the wide variety of restaurant that Montreal has to offer, your hard earned cash will be better spent elsewhere. I had a risotto that had the same texture as rice, and a mac and cheese that was lacking some richness. Yes the place is cool and the concept is trendy...but the quality and innovation of the food is just not there. Sorry not sorry.~risotto mac and cheese ~2
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~kN1VLhUJhwTIzbcH_Iot3Q~A great place for drinks and creative food after work!  Atmosphere: A very urban take on western, barn-like chic. Comfortable without being too trendy. Bathrooms (located up stairs) were gorgeous (I'm picky like that)...unisex, individual stalls/rooms with a shared marble sink.  Food: We initially went just to have drinks after work, but after checking out the menu of tapas, cheese, oysters, etc...we had to try a couple things. So we ordered 3 tapas dishes to share...smoked salmon chopped and mixed with pecans, mini bison burgers, and ceviche. All were to die for but the salmon in particular was amazing.  Service: It wasn't very busy when we first got there but got really crowded later.  The service didn't change...our waiter was attentive, super helpful (provided recommendations when asked, translated when I needed it, suggested wine to go with out order, etc). Really friendly...and when I wandered trying to find the bathroom (there were no signs), one of the chefs saw me (they make everything out in the open in the mid-back of the restaurant) and pointed out were to go...really nice guy!  Would definitely head back here!~cheese, smoked salmon ~5
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~aQD2qauQiiUPk9DaqkiB3Q~A very unique place, here's the run down on its Atmosphere, Service, & Food  Atmosphere: Grange is a very unique tapas dig - even by montreal standards.  Located in the uber-chic Old Port area, Garange is part French (france) local store / market and part Quebec mess hall.  the Cluttered decor is surprisingly seamless and very comfortable.  Service:  Very professional.  The staff knows that they operate in an expensive area - and thus go the extra mile to be that little bit more professional than the average place.  This however does not interfere with their seemingly genuine helpfulness.  Food: Tapas is the name of the game. For brunch the offers cheeses, meats, as well as freshly cooked breads and home made jams make the meal diverse, and for dinner Kraft Cheese al la Garange is an interesting order.  Chic, stylish, very "Sex in the City"~cheeses, breads cheese ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~Zy_fiL3rWIUXbl4NM7Exiw~Il y a un moment que j'y suis allée, mais pour moi c'est un endroit parfait pour un 5 à 7. Pourquoi?   Premièrement pour l'ambiance et le style de l'endroit. C'est un endroit sans prétention avec un décor robuste.   Deuxièmement, pour le type de nourriture au menu. Évidemment, il est possible de manger des plats principaux, mais le plus agréables est de se partager des planchettes d'entrées ou de finger food.  Puis, les vins sont biens.  Bémol? On ne va pas là pour le service... Plaisant, mais un peu bête.... Mais entre amis avec un verre et un bon grilled cheese à la main, on passe par dessus.   En général, j'avais bien aimé.~cheese ~3
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~G83xn2o2j0LgESWrgdpB9g~Came here late with a group of 6 - atmosphere was certainly unique - sleek but rugged, and the servers dressed in black and white plaid.  I like the way that Emma B describes it ("urban take on barn-like chic").  We were given the late-night menu, which of course was in French.  I've found most places in Montreal have English menus if you ask for them, so I asked if they had English menus.  Our server was not super pleasant - he gave us a rather gruff "no" and then walked away.  When he came back 10 minutes later to take our order, he offered to translate the menu for us, but it would've been nicer if he'd done that in the first place.  One of my friends spoke a fair amount of French and tried to order in French, and the waiter refused to answer him in French - it was kind of awkward.    Food was pretty good - we got the olive and nut app, I got the Bison burger which was small but tasty, my friend got Green Bean Poutine and his cheesecurds were out of control good.  The Tuna Tartar tasted like smoked salmon - straight delicious.  Portions were small, but in general people were happy with the food they ordered.  So yah - food was pretty decent, but with a very hot-and-cold waiter I could take or leave this place.  Also, there was a spider in my wine glass, so I'd check your glassware closely before letting them pour!~white olive burger tuna smoked salmon ~3
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~KifzGeEmwlcsNOiX6ALdOA~Je n'avais jamais entendu parler de cet endroit auparavant et je n'ai pas été déçu! Mes baby back ribs étaient succulents, le potage très bien réussi, l'ambiance était cool, le service très attentionné (notre plat principal accusait du retard, on nous a offert un excellent gravlax de saumon pour compenser). Les prix sont raisonnables du moins pour le lunch (entre 15 et 20$). La carte des vins est adéquate même si le choix au verre est restreint.  Vraiment, j'y retournerai.~ribs ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~Oe0FTzqp2jPGgb32NdL9vw~We ran across this place, located outside the craziness of Old Montreal. The waiter translated the entire menu for us, complete with commentary on what each dish is comprised of. The wine list is great. And most of our dishes tasted amazing. We really liked the beet carpacchio (who knew?) and ceviche salad. The bbq duck was okay, not great. But overall, great service, nice atmosphere (trying towards Western/"barn-like"), relaxed, and small, tapas-like plates. One of our best dining experiences in Montreal.~beet ceviche salad. ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~WdmVjicj90ptIp7vxIV4dg~Belle ambiance de 'chalet' dans ce petit resto de la rue MCGill.  Bien situé a la limite du quartier des affaires et du Vieux-Port, Grange devient un endroit facile a adopter si vous voulez passer une soirée sur les quais après le travail. Le menu est simple et concis, (tartares, salades copieuses, burgers) mais contient des choix variés pour tous les palais. Les prix sont moyens-chers (25$ une assiette). Ils ont une bonne sélection de vins également.  Le service est plus qu'amical, quoi qu'un peu lent. Nous avons bien aimé notre expérience et serons probablement de retour !~burgers) ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~nDwmLUcRFfhmxkrOdJrxFQ~We had a reservation at 7pm. When we arrived, our table was not available - the group before us "took longer than expected" - so we had to wait at the bar. We got our table around 7:30pm, but it took another 30 minutes for the waiter to take our order. The quality of the food was ok: the do-ré-mi appetizer was very good, but the salmon tartar was very salty. The ribs were good (could have more vegetables on the side), but there was way too much salt and clove in the meat pie. You don't need that much salt when the flavours are good to begin with.  But the worst part was that at 10pm (remember, they took our order at 8pm), slightly after we paid, the waiter asked if we thought of leaving soon because another group was waiting for our table ! Of course, he waited after we paid his 15% tip to ask us to leave. We were finished and would probably had left 5 minutes later, but it's the first time anyone at the table has every been asked to clear the table at a restaurant.  A near-400$ bill for a table of four, took an hour before our order was taken, salty food, and being asked to leave the table 15 minutes after dessert is served... There are too many good restaurants in the area (graziella, local, l'appart, helena, ...) to go back to this grange !  To the owner: booking three services on the same table for a night without enough staff to allow for a quick service, no hostess and no manager on a saturday night might be you're idea of a profitable restaurant, but count me out.  Visited October 2012~salmon ribs pie. ~2
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~RCk3gRx1jTaFcnreEDltrQ~What I like about walking around a new place is finding places to eat. The prices is are high, but the server was really attentive, always coming by to make sure that we were taken care of. There's a large area in the back, ideal for a big group. Had the crab chowder, it was thick and good, the mac and cheese was alright. It wasn't crowded, because the weather sucked and people tend to stay in indoors. I forgot what I got which had some crumbled popcorn which was good.~chowder, mac and cheese ~4
1cRvhC7shC6UneMqRYm4yg~YK3e6IHic7GcjXNd04cBEQ~I & my sis had a meal of a glass of wine each and a good variety of appetizers. In a word Yum! The food was impeccable - delicious. On the pricey side, nothing I'd do often but a great outing, especially for an earlier evening. It fills up and the service diminishes as the clock ticks away. Luckily, we had an early meal.  Just a note: everyone uses the word tapas to describe small plates (usually savory) eatz - to me tapas connotes Spanish or at least Latin in flavor.~appetizers. ~4
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~oAjJMmhDwy5mI0vkTDvwrQ~Acquolina Ristorante confused me.  I enjoyed my experience, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out if my food was supposed to be a high-end or a low-end meal.  A down-to-earth, friendly server invited us into the restaurant while we were loitering at the door, looking at the menu.  "C'mon in and give us a try," she said, "We make all our food fresh to order and have something for everyone."  It was a hard invitation to resist, although we did note that the restaurant was mostly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  So maybe not for everyone?  She quickly brought fresh bread, sun-dried italian olives and olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the table.  Nice opening.  We're starting to wonder why more people aren't populating this lovely place.  The menu is pretty standard with pizzas, pastas and mains.  The soup of the day is a cold gazpacho.  I brazenly ignore the fact that it's a spanish dish and order it, along with a pizza.  My husband orders a squash agnolatti with a tomato basil sauce.  I thought that was an odd combo (I'm more of a brown butter and sage person with squash-filled pasta myself), but it sounded good.  The gazpacho arrives quickly and it is delicious - bright and creamy tasting (maybe some olive oil inside?).    But the mains were strangely put together.  My pizza had a perfectly chewy thin crust, but the toppings looked and tasted bland (except for the very good olives).  It oddly had very little flavour and the cheese was cheap tasting and heavy.  It was like Pizza Pizza meets Pizza Libretto.  Weird.  The pasta dish had the same problem.  The sauce was delicious.  Very rich and flavourful - like you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  But the pasta itself was overcooked and the filling had the density of the spackle we are using to patch the walls of our new house.  No flavour at all and leaden.  What's going on here?  My guess?  The chef has a split personality and only one of them can cook.  Vegetarian score: 7/10.  Choices typical of any italian restaurant.~olive soup gazpacho. pizza tomato brown butter pasta gazpacho olive pizza cheese pizza pizza pizza pasta pasta ~3
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~df0ztC85Sc0QlnWBKIVFfA~Came here for the first time for Winterlicious.    I ordered their spinach salad, cannelloni, and cheesecake.  The food was delicious, but the presentation was unattractiveand the portions were on the small side.  I left still feeling hungry.  I wouldn't come back to this restaurant because I was completely turned off by the service.  Almost as soon as we were seated, the waiter bustled by and said "I'm going to take your order now because we're going to be very busy later".  This rush was confusing, as we were the first people seated at the restaurant that night and the rest of the tables were entirely empty.~spinach salad, ~3
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~zazkE0r4Vg-Z6_hi2F8L6g~terrible summerlicious menu - cheap bland food that they obviously pass off for the summerlicious menu for a cash grab - overly greasy fish with no flavor, potatoes baked with no salt or anything else on them, pasta with bland tomato sauce, packaged ice cream put on a plate (I say this because I saw them just take it out of plastic wrap and put it on the plate)  just spent $100 on the worst meal.~pasta tomato ice cream ~1
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~QMxis4mX9QN_AxuVAQ-RzA~In a neighbourhood filled with good Italian restaurants, why would Acquolina, whose food I've always considered quite good, never gain popularity?  The same reason I've encountered  there in the past- the poor service.  Specifically the 69 year-old head waiter whose snarky arrogant attitude and indifference has no place in an overcrowded restaurant market, like Toronto's.  Although my wife & son both enjoyed their most recent meals, I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials of the night: Lobster & scallop pasta.  For a mere $27, I received a meager overcooked lobster tail and a single(!) scallop over an otherwise tasty pasty with cherry tomato & fresh basil.    I would have shared my dissapointment with my pompous waiter, but once the plates were on our table, we were completely ignored by him, two foodrunners and the manager/owner (sho has always been hlpful & friendly in the past).  In the end, I asked for my cheque...twice.  The tip I left reflected my feelings, but being in the industry myself, I declined leaving nothing at all, despite my urges.  In the future, my money will be spent at restaurants like Ferro and Marcello's, who've figured it out, great food + great service = great experience.  In summary, Acquolina: Good food + Lousy service = we will not be returning~pasta. cherry tomato & ~2
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~mcFScREtbibgBEDEntSRPw~Visited Acquolina last night for Summerlicious and was very happy with the meal and service.   Acquolina's menus offers a great variety of Italian fare - so much variety that there is definitely something to please everyone.   Carpaccio and mussels appetizers were quickly brought to our table and very fresh. For our main we enjoyed Agnolotti with spinach and ricotta in a cream sauce along with Penne Salsiccia with sausage and a tomato wine sauce. The serving sizes were more than enough to fill us up. Great Italian wine selection (Chianti!) and tasty desserts topped off our meal. The service was friendly, unrushed and attentive.   The restaurant has just had a complete reservation - neat, clean lines with an elegant interior design.   Overall a great value for the dollar; tasty food, nice sized servings and good service.~appetizers agnolotti spinach salsiccia sausage tomato desserts ~4
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~F1yfJ16lBxaX3tE7BIZO9A~I'd heard good things but found our first meal here a little disappointing.  The arugula salad was nice, but the mussels were just on this side of salable and served in a tomato sauce that was a little overwhelming.  The pasta was better, but the lamb shank was disappointing with nowhere near the flavor you'd expect. The wines-by-the-glass selection was excellent, as was the attentive service - with a little more work on the food, this could be exceptional, but not there yet.  We will go again to give it another try, but there are better places on the St Clair strip.~arugula salad tomato pasta lamb ~2
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~_25LKIoZ0m3hyE4cktcegA~We ate here a few weeks ago and it was overall pleasant. There were only two other people dining when we arrived. We were fearful that this was a reflection on the food but this was not the case.   The gazpacho was absolutely delicious! I'm usually skeptical of cold soups but this was a hit!   Linguine Trifolate was cooked in a garlic, white wine with mushroom and chicken. I refused to share any of my pasta due to how amazing it was. The only complaint I had was with the chicken. It was a bit dry.   The fish of the day was a sea bass. It wasn't the greatest sea bass I've had but the person who ordered it didn't seem to mind.   I'm not sure if I'd visit again only because I love to try new resturants. However, if I did I'm sure I'd be ordering the same thing.~gazpacho garlic, white mushroom chicken. pasta chicken. ~3
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~Jh7-tupc_kqJUO5K2pHPZw~My friend and I tried this restaurant out during Winterlicious and we enjoyed it well enough. My recommendation is if you're in the area and in the mood for Italian, yes, give it a try. I can't say I'd visit again given the endless restaurants in the city I still long to visit but I'm still happy I gave it a try.  My friend chose the carpaccio to start, then trout, and tiramisu for dessert. I opted for the mussels, pizza, and chocolate mousse cake.  Likes: -Oil and vinegar brought with bread -Mussels were amazing! -Pizza was delicious; definitely give it a try! -Service was very pleasant; I especially appreciated the knowledge of the wine from the main lady working that evening  -Ambience is pleasant, but nothing fancy or exciting  Dislikes: Quality of bread - Boring, bland, old bun. I expected something with my texture and definitely fresher Carpaccio was flavourless - would never order this again Coffee was offered after our desserts were served (Personal pet peeve of mine; I like my coffee there when my dessert arrives. Who wants to stare at their dessert while they wait for their coffee to be served?)  FYI - The do not take debit.~pizza cake. coffee desserts coffee coffee ~3
61GK4EGXBd4uha_2unicNw~GTAMjo3lf1va2RcVBRGhDg~Loved Acquolina when it was on Mt. Pleasant Road before but now moved to St. Clair Avenue West. It has great unpretentious Italian Food. Lots of choice in the menu, great salads, pastas and entrees. YUM!!!   We are big eaters and the plates were almost too much...sadly though not too too much!   Try the Tiramisu!   I do hate what the City has done to St. Clair Avenue West street-scape but that is not Acquolina's fault. Check it out!~salads, ~4
CHm0hyY81CWDutaYCztFSg~48bvuseiMn5rL6y5aSzrfA~After having such a miserable experience, I feel socially obligated to post this review no later than 30 minutes after eating at Ocarnivores so that others do not suffer the same fate as myself.  In no particular order, let's count some ways that make this place the worst attempt to copy Chipotle ever:  1.) They were out of pico de gallo; 2.) They were out of lettuce; 3.) The food server picked the salsa and sour cream bottles out of a container with melted ice and the water from the bottle dripped all in the burritos and rice bowl as the items were poured; 4.) The food server continually touched the tortilla to her filthy shirt as she made the burrito; 5.) The food tasted stale and the salsa was not good; 6.) The bowl was almost the same price as Chipotle yet it was half the size; 7.) There weren't any other customers and the servers stared at me while I ate; and 8.) They didn't have any type of sign for visibility.  A $9 "meal for two" Groupon brought me here.  The pictures were grossly misrepresented on Groupon.  Without a doubt, save your time and money and avoid this place like the plague.  Some businesses truly deserve to fail and this is one of them.~lettuce; salsa sour cream burritos burrito; salsa ~1
CHm0hyY81CWDutaYCztFSg~VERcyKVcBZF2oLIihIjG1A~I am unsure if one star is low enough. We asked if they were ever referred to as the fake chipotle.  The girl was very smug and replied, the difference is we make all our own food.  Hmmm, ok, well let's give you a try.  We wanted a chicken burrito and a chicken salad.   The girl was slowly making quesadillas one at a time, and said our order would be a while. When our order arrived, the salad was tiny and all thrown together. The burrito was supposed to have guacamole, and had a tiny bit in one end. Beans were undercooked and tasteless.  Rice was bland and resembled minute rice from a box. Chicken had no identifiable flavor at all. We were not impressed with the food, atmosphere, ie wwf smack down really loud, or the food.  There were only a handful of people there, and the quality of the food is probably why.  We won't be going back.  A real chipotle is always close by.~chicken burrito ~1
CHm0hyY81CWDutaYCztFSg~lDdLwN9UAsUFgWoTpGW75g~I feel really bad writing this review - but I have to. Ok, here it goes. They have no liquor license, but their menu on the wall shows prices for beer, etc. They also do not currently serve 1/2 of the food menu on the wall but it's in bold, large letters. I don't know why they don't cover it if they're not serving it.   First of all, the first time we went they were out of guacamole, lettuce and cilantro. The staff was super friendly so I decided to give them another shot today.   Today they were out of straws and medium sauce. *sigh*The salsa was good but the beans were really hard and my tortilla was burnt. I had to pay $2 extra for guacamole and there wasn't hardly any in there.   The portion for the burrito was HUGE but the beans were hard so it wasn't super enjoyable.   I don't think I'll be going back and to be honest, there isn't much food traffic going in there. I don't see it being open for too long.~lettuce cilantro. salsa burrito ~1
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~n3YiB7Mk-QYorzmV_Sl93g~I really like this place. Nice clean pool hall. Good quality tables. Nice micro -brew beer selection on tap and good nachos. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff.~nachos. ~4
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~GHqcnAQx_eheX29tzG3zCQ~This place is Ranchy.   My friends and I went here to celebrate my departure and we were told great things about this place.   When  we first walked it, it was quiet and full of people in there 30s. We didn't mind since we all are in our 20s. We found a few places to sit near a pool table since we wanted to play. We waited for a server to come but she looked too busy chatting with the older people beside us to even pay attention so we went to the bar ourselves and ordered. The gentleman bartender was a total ass. He gave us snoody looks and didn't treat us like his other customers. He gave us so much spazz and attitude because we ordered a whole bunch of drinks that he had to make.   Anyways, we went back to our sitting area and thought it would be good to play a game of pool. I went up to him and asked for the supplies needed. He gave it to me and said to return it on the hour. Whatever, we did that and we payed. We decided to play for another hour. When I went to ask for the white ball, he told me he couldn't give it to me because there were people waiting to use the table.   I noticed that there were 3 other empty tables but I figured the customers had prefered this table. I didn't mind. My friends and I waited for two hours sipping drinks and talking. NOO ONE SHOWED UP and the 3 other tables were still empty!  I went back to ask him if we could play and he told me no. That we had already used it for the night.  So I asked if we could relocate and use another table. He seemed to get angry by my asking so I dropped it and we left.   DURING THAT WHOLE TIME, THE FEMALE WAITER WAS STILL TALKING IT UP WITH THE OLDER PEOPLE BESIDE US. SHE DIDN'T PAY MIND TO ANYONE THAT WALKED INTO THE PLACE.  THIS PLACE SUCKS!~white ~2
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~_wda8zbVkBJB7dKaT_-fqA~To be completely honest, it bugs me that I don't go here more often, as I always have a dandy time.  The Charlotte Room is tucked away in a side street, Charlotte Street oddly enough, that allows it to have a nice secluded patio away from the majority of traffic.  You enter either from the patio side, or in the winter, through what appears to be an apartment or office building-style lobby area.  The first time you enter it sort of takes you aback.  Once you're in the Charlotte, you're faced with the main reason many go there.  Pool tables.  Several tables wait to be played all in good repair.  The bar at the back is full service and the menu is small and focussed, relying on pub-food faves.  TVs are available to watch sports on in the comfort of comfortable furniture.  It sort of feels like a gentleman's club (not that kind of gentleman's club, thank you, remove your mind from the gutter) for the non-executive type.  There is a side room that is also available for performers of many kinds.  Typically it's open to the likes of poetry readings and the like, but once a month, the Charlotte opens its doors to free stand-up comedy one Saturday out of the month.  I've been lucky enough to be on a few of the shows, and the crowds are always great.  The great response, the food (the nachos, by the way, are a delight), the pool, the room, I should go more than just for the shows.  If you feel like going, call me and I'll get my coat.~nachos, ~5
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~Kann5dteQ1BvdqhQk96dpQ~super hidden bar/pool lounge in the middle of downtown and just right behind MEC.  there are tons of pool tables (haven't checked the prices) and a mini patio up front.  the bar at the back is ok. beer is priced at $6-8 a pint. food wise - not too much choice for vegetarians. and none for vegans. well unless you consider salad to be food. I think they had 1 or 2 salads on the menu.   GAdventures office is right next door so you might bump into employees of that company at the bar at any time of the day... and night=) ahahaha~salad salads ~3
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~tlitwJfeAVO7XINx3ZG5Ig~I was only here for a short while at the tail end of my friend's surprise birthday.  They had booked a pool table and a small corner for a drop in birthday party.   When I was there, we had a dedicated server, who was super friendly and seemed to be really on top of things. I know they were busy with a large party of rowdy Second City alums, but seemed like she still was able to make it us every so often, even though our drinks sometime disappeared.   They have couches, and small tables. You can play board games, pool and we had brought our own cake and snacks and they seemed really cool with it.   It's steps from King and Adelaide, so take a walk of the strip here instead!~cake ~3
0WBMEfqXQnEOAIkV-uCW6w~8OhMVo2sXm_eKPKahmUEZg~The Charlotte Room is a surprisingly big pool hall near King West. It's on a particularly unassuming road, and would be very easy to miss if you were in the area. They had a reasonable selection of beers when I was there, featuring a lot of stuff from local brewer Mill St. I thought their appetizers were good, but it's probably not a place to come for dinner. It's probably a good place for work events and the like, and I suspect a lot of their business comes from the near by offices. I can't think of too many places to play pool downtown, let alone places that aren't sketchy. So this is definitely a place for that.~appetizers ~4
5MPMTU0AZY0LuAT3Zt4TkA~aBpSDMlYSMy0lIWSMk3zxQ~So I'm like to my friend Claire; "You want a ride home?" Halfway down on Front Street at Spadina, suddenly she has a change of heart, RSVPs to a party, and after a painful impromptu massage, I found myself at BCBG Max Azria shopping for her outfit for her function.  I love it when things work out.   Apparently, Claire is a regular customer, which meant the Italian/Korean sales girl dedicated an exhaustive amount of time tending to the both of us.  I say the both of us because I was very much involved in the dress selection process...since I'm like amazing and have impossible taste.   This location is very well stocked; at the front of the floor are where all of the ugly casual outfits are which appear to be melting off of the rack.  When you dwell deeper into the store the whole atmosphere changes, and although these are not the prettiest dresses in the world, I felt comfortable with what I was surrounded by.   Long gowns, cocktail dresses, body napkins and mad fashion experiments.  I didn't think I saw a single outfit here costing over $500.  Although, In my opinion that's a steep price to pay for the mediocre stitching, and non-precious materials.  However, there was something any girl would be able to squeeze into, so I definitely saw how this store can be a life saver for a girl on the go.    Nicole--the sales girl--remained very patient while maintaining her pearly whites while Claire rifled through every potential dress in the store.  I sat on the lounge in the changing area, and felt like somehow I wasn't supposed to be here.  Each change room was curtained off, but this was still technically a female change area.  But hey, nobody said anything, so I enjoyed myself while approving and disapproving each dress Claire tried on.  I really appreciated how spacious the changing area was, and how sectioned off it felt from the sales floor.    After what must have been forty minutes, I finally grabbed a sequence dress off of the racks, shoved it into Claire's arms and watched as she fell in love with herself in it.  $440+ later (with an 8% discount) I was shaking Nicole's hands and we got the hell out of there and marched off to Yorkville for some much-needed sushi.   Claire was very impressed by my affinity with women's fashion, and I was very happy with how much she trusted in my advice.    I never expect for such attentive service from a non-couturier.~sushi. ~4

3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~YPhP8Cf36cgTvl1xo0bXdA~Well, Chuck on St. Clair has gone under - it sported a "closed for renovation" sign for a week or so, but that's been replaced by a couple of inexpertly-lettered "for lease" signs.  I'm afraid the writing was on the wall from the day it opened.   1)  There is some stiff damn competition in this neighbourhood.  If you're looking for a place where two people can get a delicious, unpretentious meal for under $50, you've got Churrasco of St. Clair, Stockyards, Mezzetta, and Vannis - and that's all within 50 meters of the corner of St. Clair & Christie.  If you're willing to go another block or two, you've got great Mexican and good Indian, too.    2)  You're selling burgers across the street from Stockyards.  Yes, Chuck had better seating and a liquor license, but the food wasn't as good and there wasn't much of a price difference.    3)  The ambiance was all wrong for this neighbourhood.  Did I call it "nouveau abbatoir" in my earlier review?  I should have.  If I'm looking for a haven after a long day at work, I don't want  bare bulbs and an interior that looks like it was designed for easy hosing off.  It's a shame - the staff were always really nice, and the burgers weren't bad.  I hate to see a place go under in my area, but the mix was just wrong.  I dropped by for takeout poutine on election night; the place was dead silent, and I was a bit uncomfortable as I waited for my junk food.  The stench of death was on the place already.  I got home, and the portion was huge and piping hot - but the gravy was bland, and I pitched a good chunk of it out.  Better luck next time, Chuck owners.~burgers burgers ~2
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~wak4Mn3NpNzQ2YfbEKHRBw~I heard this place had great burgers so figured I'd give it a try. Turns out it wasn't worth wasting my money on which is really too bad because the restaurant is really nice looking and could be great, they just need to learn how to make a really good burger and maybe bring the price down a little as well.~burgers burger ~2
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~tW7oz_1s5w-HxPuc02UVrQ~Burgers are good. Fries are great.  Try the bacon and cheese it is really delicious.  This place just needs a good manager and some atmosphere.  Floor is sticky. Music is hard to hear, they need a sound system. Take the stickers off the windows and door.  I think this place will close because it is never busy.  I am hoping they get the energy up and draw a bigger crowd, because the food is a great addition to the neighbourhood.~burgers fries bacon cheese ~3
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~pSrP3Vn446tKTWodatw0xA~thought of trying that place and it looked cool from the outside.  in short, wasn't too impressed.  the burger was good and the fries as well. service was nice, however the atmosphere was not right and it was too pricy.  the place looked really dirty and unfinished. paid for 2 burgers with sides and 2 cokes $40.....  it has potential (look, menu), but it seems it is not being runned well~burger fries burgers ~2
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~9rxUeP7XnQ7flw6FXJOSqw~Meant to go to Smokehouse on St. Clair, but the place was jam packed so ventured across the street to Chuck and Co instead.  Looked like a nice place, but oddly, completely empty.  That's always a worry, but we went anyway.  Apparently, they won a prize for best burger in Toronto Life, so must be okay.  Noticed that they fry burgers on a griddle instead of char broiling though.  Odd for a real burger place.  Isn't frying a burger a bit like boiling toast?  So we ordered.  I had the award winning Montreal Burger which featured smoked meat.  We also had a Juicy Lucy which has mozzarella inside it and a portobello mushroom burger.  We ordered some fries which arrived first, like a  starter, which was odd.  They were good, but fries are meant to go with a burger.  That's basic burger stuff to me.  The burgers arrived after we finished the fries completely.  The portobello burger had two small and limp mushrooms rather than a nice big one, so that was disappointing.  They were pretty greasy too.  My Montreal burger was okay, but as it was fried, not a great flavour to me.  The buns were kind of heavy, so I didn't like them too much either.  The Juicy Lucy was missing the cheese completely, so back it went.  It arrived a bit later and it had the cheese but also a kind of funny smell and taste.  It seemed to us like the meat might be too old.  I didn't like it at all and the others didn't have this taste or smell, so that was worrying.  So, I guess I know why it was completely empty when we arrived and when we left.  Service was charming and friendly, but that's kind of small potatoes.  These were not good burgers.~burger burgers burger burger burger mozzarella mushroom burger. fries fries burger. burger burgers fries burger mushrooms burger cheese cheese potatoes. burgers. ~1
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~KXffqXeJQOuLDKXi2PAejg~I really wish I had liked this place as it is in my hood, but wow was it ever disappointing. First the bun. Huge, doughy and overwhelming. Then the burger - bland and too small for the bun. Then the toppings. Slathered with so much mustard you couldn't taste anything else. I had the bacon cheeseburger (so much bun you couldn't taste the bacon, cheese or burger). I followed that up with the Montreal burger which supposedly had smoked meat which you couldn't taste because of the bun and the mustard. Will never return as there so many good burger joints in this town (Gourmet Burger Co. The Burger Shack, Five Guys, etc.). Was very surprised that NOW magazine gave it a decent review in their 50 Best Burgers feature recently.~burger - bacon bacon, cheese burger) burger burger burger burger burgers ~1
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~Fy9DxJ4KBB902EZgbng8CQ~After being yelled at by a server at The Stockyards for asking how long the wait would be, we went across the street to a little, unassuming burger shoppe Chuck and Co. Though it looked like a auto garage on the inside, the service was prompt and friendly and the brunch menu was big AND included their trademark burgers.   The wait for the food was reasonable and, even though, strangely, my burger did not come with fries, it was a tasty hunk of ground chuck meat on an amazing caibatta bun.  A nice burger joint with big, thick cut pieces of bacon everyone can enjoy!~burger burgers. burger fries, burger bacon ~3
3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ~brepOAHJJ46d5C8r6QXBbQ~Experience similar to Trish Q's. Went for brunch and first thought was  "Why is this floor so sticky?"  There was maybe one or two other tables in there - the space is new, nice, and professionally designed. Lots of black and wood and hanging light-bulbs.  The prices looked reasonable (~10$ or so) and food was OK.  My hard-fried egg was greasy and hardly fried. Sort of YUCKY.  The banana pancakes were quite good. They were served with peanut butter and jam on the side - I'm not sure why.  Thick cut bacon was an excellent side. VERY good bacon. Almost like beef jerky.  Fries were tiny shoe-string, tepid, and dry. Not great.  The electronic payment machine was down, but they told us at the end of the meal so I had to walk to a convenience store and get charged 3$ to take out cash. Didn't like that so much.  Service was a little weak, also.  I would go back for a burger and beer- if they wash that floor.~egg banana pancakes peanut butter ~2
1t7wb97YxgMP3zAWkv2wiw~uSAMWhNhQF7-SDOsEo2sxg~Dangerous place, full of gangs, pimps and prostitutes, I recovered my stolen car from this motel, my car was stolen from me in Las Vegas the day after halloween, the thieves were staying at this motel, it was a pimp and his hoe who were staying in room 36 above the front office. the place was swarming with pimps, prostitutes, and gang bangers and druggies, I am looking to sue this place for harboring the criminals who stole my car. I double dog dare the management to respond to this review, mine was the 2016 white Dodge Charger. see you in court.~white ~1
A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~APptVtgWfvQ_wckN7mhkTw~Offers a wide variety of bubble tea flavours, although I admittedly order some strawberry/banana variant almost every time so I'm not well qualified to speak to how good all their flavours are, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoy their strawberry banana offering and that service was good, prices seemed reasonable and they offer both late hours and a convenient location.~tea banana ~4
A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~8v1nY-gfS42o-ck9XB27PA~Came here because I desperately had to use the bathroom ... so I paid $7 (I think) for a subpar fresh fruit mango bubble tea.  It wasn't delicious.  I have had better.  And it was over-priced.  The bathroom was really gross too ... not E-Tea's fault since I think they share the bathroom with the other tenants in the building.  But, it is one of those washrooms you see in movies - narrow hallway, dark, dingy, yucky, and although this washroom didn't have a single hanging light bulb with a string to turn on and off, one would have fit perfectly in this washroom.  Anyway, still on the hunt for a yummy fresh fruit bubble tea :)~mango tea. tea tea :) ~2
A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~c2p1TUfSUOcv6oLBZwoYwA~- ALOT of flavours - I ordered avocado but it wasn't that good - I generally prefer liquid mixes but they used powders so it tasted less real to me - open late. Til 2am. Great for late night cravings. - space to sit around and hang out - taste was generally ok..but my boyfriend loved his strawberry banana though.~avocado banana ~3
A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~NtdNqxJ3sc3CoEyYzFNJdg~E- Tea has two sections- the bubble tea takeout counter and in the back they have a little restaurant. My review is based on my bubble tea experience.  E-Tea is somewhat small but has a large counter where they serve different types of bubble teas, iced-coffees, Italian soda's etc. My intention was to buy some bubble tea supplies for home but the guy working there did not have any. Instead, he directed me to Asian markets around the area where I could find some; I thought that was really nice and helpful.  After looking over the gigantic beverage menu, I decided upon a mango bubble tea. The bubble teas here are made out of powder and come in one standard sized cup. I paid around $3.77 for a cup which was about 14oz. The drink was refreshing and the tapioca was cooked perfectly. However, the mango flavor did not taste too much like mango which was disappointing. I also find the price to be much for a drink like that.  Not a big fan of the bubble tea here, but I'm willing to give them another chance just because the guy working here was really kind and helpful.~tea tea tea tea tea mango tea. mango mango tea ~2
A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~PnMFmoIuiVHLyY_jPJm6KQ~Decent quality and open late. I got the passionfruit bubble tea.   PROS -cheap -open late -friendly service  CONS -tiny ass bubbles -flavours arent all that impressive~tea. ~3

A49jCMzZXswmSAZqZUAi8Q~lR1VZgqUV1HQGWQRYrQceg~Stopped by for the variety of flavors they offer. Ended up getting a Honey Aloe Vera hot tea which was delicious and not too sweet. It came from a jar of green "stuff" that looked like the consistency of crushed up Aloe Vera. Now that's what I'm talking about. They even threw in some tapioca for free so I could try it.   I haven't tried the food but I'd recommend stopping by for any kind of drink you could want.~honey tea ~4
F_grYTnIPE1_Wwlfvt0J4Q~l1x5EvNMTyNn8_Mcdl6a3w~This is one of nicest, well-run subways I've been too. It was spotless has a great feel inside. Carmen made my meatball sub today. Probably the freshest meatballs I've ever gotten. Then I noticed here instantly restocking what had been used. This restaurant is fortunate to have hired a polite, hard-working like Carmen.     Thank you for the pleasant lunch!~meatballs ~5
F_grYTnIPE1_Wwlfvt0J4Q~HZPXCWY0Apm689Bp5I808w~The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.~sandwiches greens avocado... sandwiches ~2
F_grYTnIPE1_Wwlfvt0J4Q~NxRdnqPzOoFYyHzD_jzLbg~NOW serving breakfast @subwayfreshbuzz made YOUR way!!! CHEAP + good-not your typical Fast-Food!! I love the whole wheat muffins and being able to load it up anyway you want depending on what mood you are in.~wheat ~3
F_grYTnIPE1_Wwlfvt0J4Q~HJ34bvDxtQsz4IieHX2IfQ~Expectations aren't too high for a 24 hour Subway within a casino, but perhaps if the employees weren't male and facing the screens of the sports book, service would be more attentive.  Visited this weekend while a major game was playing, wanting to grab a pizza- Subway pizza is delicious, try one if you haven't already.  Employee was polite but incredibly slow. Between carrying on a conversation with his coworker and staring at the game screen, the guy barely had the capacity left to focus on making my order. It was simple, too.  Received it finally, hot and delicious. Only complaint is that veggies were not chopped up prior to adding to the pizza- other locations have cut them into smaller pieces, as for the salads, before baking, but not here. Giant pieces of pepper and onion tore up the cheese as I ate my individual pieces.~pizza salads, onion cheese ~2
BsI3XTHD4ZlFZz0uJcjtwA~3RUAb5F9M_5u-1Cjrxk3Sg~This event was fun but crazy with how many people attended. The class registration queues seemed unorganised and long, and we weren't told when we came that we had to book for the classes which was frustrating to say the least! The classes we went to were informative and fun, especially the one by Iggy from Iggs restaurant. Although he was great, the event staff weren't very friendly and were not organised about or receptive to giving out samples of these top chefs' work. They did let us sample the great seafood dish from Iggs but with the chef from Hotel Missoni they let some people sample the pumpkin rissoto (understandable that they were concerned about allowing samples for the fish) but then took the rissoto dish away and tisked those of us still waiting for samples. I wasn't very impressed by the staff.   Considering this was a paid event, most of the stalls in the main event exhibition hall were a bit stingy in selling food and not giving very many samples, which was a bit sad. They also didn't have that good deals in selling their things. The Edinburgh Gin was apparently reduced down to £17 for a mid-sized bottle, but a quick google search shows that is the same price that Royal Mile Whiskies sells it for. Oh well.   Overall the event was ok but you needed to brace yourself for crowds and long queues!~pumpkin ~3
BsI3XTHD4ZlFZz0uJcjtwA~_5J9Pj3A_IzIRsR2SX-f-Q~We've been to Foodies Festivals before, but this was the first we'd been to at the EICC. Unfortunately, we went on Saturday, and it was beyond crowded and verging on dangerous. They should have allowed much more space between stands to reduce the crush, making grazing more pleasurable, and rendering it safe for pushchairs and wheelchairs.   While there was little knew in terms of exhibitors, the quality was high and the samples good. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, was doing a roaring trade throughout the day, with some excellent produce; I recommend their sausages with Scotch Bonnet peppers. Unfortunately, the crowds they generated added to the crush.   A good time, then, but disappointingly badly organised.~sausage sausages ~2
BsI3XTHD4ZlFZz0uJcjtwA~3VQiV1N1GiXAKMlSTBqJRg~Well I really enjoyed the Foodies Festival. We got there about 11.30 and it wasnt too busy, thankfully we decided not to go on the Saturday as I had heard it was mega busy and unorganised, however we went Sunday It was busy but not anything we couldnt cope with.  We managed to get around all the stalls and sample all the yummy produce on show!  We scoffed a Malteiser cake - that my boyfriend could only describe as 'epic' from Mimi's Bakery..it lasted 5 seconds! Nom nom nom  We tasted Gin, Whiskey, Prosecco, Ginger Beer, German Beer........ Nice...Ohhh and we had a coconut and Rum in a coconut and when we had finished he cut the coconut open so we could eat the inside - tasty!. I ate Salmon, sausages, Salami, yummy chocolate and hot chocolate from The fabulous Chocolate Tree. Then we wandered over to the Yelp stall to speak to lovely Katie , she was doing a right grand job and was smiling away :) I bought some Hot and Spicy pepper Caviar and we ate that later with some nice bread and Balsamic Vinegar ! Oh the life :) We didnt stay for any of the Masterclasses as the queues were getting larger at that point and the goodie bag we got had two butter biscuits and 2 pieces of shortbread between the two of us, which i thought wasnt much given all the produce on show.   Luckily we got our tickets via Itison for £13 for 2, and it was definatley worth it, maybe not full price, but it really was a treat and a good way of spending a few hours :) I just wish id bought more!~cake - ginger coconut coconut coconut salmon, sausages, salami, butter ~4
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~mtNxP7mmPwz4XoaeoH5Bpg~Sweetlix has the advantage of being the only frozen yogurt place downtown, but frankly I'd be willing to travel to any of the other Razzy Fresh locations instead if I really needed some fro-yo.   The atmosphere inside is sort of like a 12 year old girl's bedroom, but less cozy. There also aren't any chairs inside, making eating your yogurt there slightly awkward. But the biggest problem is that this place just isn't all that good. There are only a few flavors, and since they sell their yogurt by size and not by ounce, getting toppings can be a bit tricky. They'll fill your medium cup and then there won't be room for the strawberries and brownie bites that you want on top. When we went most of our toppings ended up on the counter. Very disappointing. Plus it was just a little bit too pricy for what they give you.  Overall, avoid if possible. Go get some soft-serve instead.~frozen yogurt ~2
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~o-bajzgUSwRYz3mzNKAR3g~A friend and I dropped by Sweetlix on one of those heat-index-of-120F days, because waiting for the AAA guy in the Smithfield-Liberty garage was about to kill both of us. We figured we could cool off with some frozen yogurt (I refuse to call it "froyo") and sit around in the AC for a while.  I wasn't sure which flavor I wanted when I went in; I asked about the tangy one and the girl described it with some assistance from the other person behind the counter, but never offered a sample. I ended up with the Snickerdoodle, which was good but tasted essentially like eggnog (i.e. nutmeg, not cinnamon). I am, in general, not a fan of stuff either in or on my frozen dairy products, so it was unadorned. The texture was great, and the taste was amazing, too -- just not really quite as labeled. If I were going to put toppings on this flavor, I'd go with raspberries, honey and cinnamon sugar. That'd be pretty tasty.  Sadly, the atmosphere is pretty lacking. The AC was barely running, so my frozen treat was melting fast while I was standing at a table to eat. They could really do with some chairs in there. The girls at the counter were more interested in chatting about whether the one should go on a date with that guy with the tattoos than paying attention to us.  Given the ambiance/lack thereof, I'd say it seems a little overpriced. The yogurt was good, but not THAT good. I haven't tried Razzy Fresh but I'd go there first before returning to Sweetlix.~frozen yogurt ( eggnog ( honey date ~3
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~2ROl_3Ralt1YURsRpF5DKQ~Hooray! Hooray! Sweetlix is open!  Brrrr....on a 38 degree day I was one of the first through the door, you KNOW you were missed!  Not only did I have company, we picked some up for others in the office, too.   We were tempted to opening day by Sweetlix's announcement of SIX flavors each day. Wow....decisions, decisions....in the end I just had to go with the original tart. So sweet and lemony....fat-free and only 90 calories of pure,  decadent, smooth and creamy yumminess. My walking partner and I often plan our lunchtime walks to hit Sweetlix at the end for a sweet reward.  Next time I think it will be the pomegranate-raspberry, or will you have chocolate in the rotation of flavors?  Maybe original tart with kiwi and coconut...or maybe.....  Welcome back!!!!!~pomegranate- coconut... ~4
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~AMPe3FkVLzu_k8HiEEDcUg~I'm usually not a big fan of the "tart frozen yogurt" craze that's sweeped the larger cities and now apparently Pittsburgh.  But for some reason, Sweetlix's yogurt are tasty to me - mabye b/c it's not as tart as some of the frozen yogurt I've had at other places (in other cities).  I enjoy the selection of toppings, but usually keep it simple to graham cracker crumbs and a bit of honey.    Defintely check this place out and while your at it stop in at get some savory (or sweet if you want a double dose) Pittsburgh Popcorn Company popcorn.~frozen yogurt" frozen yogurt honey. popcorn popcorn. ~4
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~FK4ul6bGg2pvw2H7E1CEAA~Don't waste your time going here. They only had 3 machines (so 6 flavors) and 1 was broken! The other machines are perhaps broken, too, because all of the ice cream was melting as it was coming out. The toppings were sad...not many choices, and they looked like they were days old. Also, the facility needs to be cleaned including the workers dirty hands and fingernails!~ice cream ~2
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~73mnRjdtvjcciRFLPO9g7Q~Definitely improving overall in quality and presentation.  I tried their Bacon Maple Doughnut froyo ... wow.  Not bad at all!!~bacon doughnut ~3
3TRpWYsF04VLf5y2lk5b4w~yO0iywMZdOkYLxynksaEOQ~Ohhhhhh Razzy Fresh you've met your match!!    Maybe it's because I can't actually stand in front of the machines like I do at Razzy Fresh and decide against the fattening Cake Batter yogurt.  Four choices written on a dry erase board.    The only one my eyes went to was NY Cheesecake.  Of course!  It's like picking the most expensive thing on the menu....except this time it's the worst for you.    But gosh darnit, it was GOOOOOD!  I'm hooked!  Pile on the brownie bits and sprinkles and I'm in.  That's how I roll, healthy yogurt turned bad but oh so good!~cake ~4

Come by during the summer and you lift find their Son, Duncan, delivering refreshing lemonade to sun beaten warriors of the concrete jungle!  And did I mention that Adriene Oftedahl Sanders is a Moon Valley Rockets Alum? So you have a local hometown family making it happen!  We stopped by to grab a sandwich and say "Hi!"

19RFEJnuHCo03LsHzKiJcg~giDa41luag5KghFvFf68Dw~This place is great and Chef Tom and his wife are very welcoming! It's a quaint little shop that reminds me of a cigar store back home in NY and also has an East Coast deli feel. I haven't had the sandwiches because I'm a vegetarian but my hubby has and he loves them! I am, however, one who loves baked goods, and this place doesn't disappoint! They have a dessert called the doughfin (lemon poppy muffin with a donut consistency inside) that's to die for, and just the other day, they introduced us to their regular and chocolate chip homemade coconut macaroons which were melt in your mouth delicious! This place is a must when visiting the Phoenix area!~sandwiches lemon coconut ~5

Tom and his staff are very friendly. They have comfortable seating as well. They also offer some deli sandwiches as well. I am looking forward to trying those at a later date. The shop is very clean as well.  5 stars for sure !~coffee cookies. sandwiches date. ~5

19RFEJnuHCo03LsHzKiJcg~-689sXcpB0BoNiWe9Fz0Uw~They are never open. Their website states open daily . Monday-Friday: 7.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.  I've tried to go in several times for a cup of coffee and its like 9-10 am and they are still not open. The owner closes whenever he wants with no notice. He needs to change the information on his website if this continues. They also have a weak selection of items, just a few sandwiches and they never actually have any baked goods... weird considering it is a bakery!! It takes these people half an hour to make one sandwich! definitely not suitable for someone who is on a quick lunch break, you will spend your entire lunch waiting on your food to be prepared. I tried to give this place a chance but they just have poor customer service.~coffee sandwiches sandwich! ~1
3GZ4bsAp15Cn75ZaiLZNOw~kxY1deP5HIvXgOaFPluv7w~wir waren richtig kaputt gestern abend, als wir von unserer möbelhäuser-abklapper-tour zurück in heimatliche gefilde waren. noch kochen? dazu war ich eindeutig zu fertig, also entschieden wir uns essen zu gehen. da fiel uns wieder ein, daß wir den asiaten in der bahnhofstr. testen wollten. der laden sah so einladend und untypisch asiatisch von außen aus, daß uns dieser gleich wieder einfiel. wir fuhren also gezielt dorthin. wir parkten an der straße, gibt ja genug plätze. die plätze hinterm haus sind nämlich nicht für gäste, die scheinen alle privat zu sein. wir studierten die außen ausgehängte karte und empfanden die preise als absolut korrekt. wir staunten als wir den ersten blick durch die glastüre wagten, das soll ein asiate sein? wir öffneten die türe und staunten noch mehr. die wände in lila und flieder gestrichen, tische und stühle in dunklem holz und die stühle entweder in mokka- oder cremeweißleder bezogen. liebevolle aber dezente details wie orchideen und stilvolle asiatische figuren ergänzten das zurückhaltend moderne ambiente. in die küche kann man durch eine glasscheibe schauen, und den köchen beim wokschwenken zusehen. wir wurden von einer sehr freundlichen dame begrüßt, die uns den hinweis gab, es wäre kein tisch mehr frei. jedoch rückte sie ein bißchen näher und flüsterte, daß die damen hinter uns bereits bezahlt hätten und kurz vor dem gehen seien. wir bedankten uns mit einem zwinker und warteten dezent draußen im eingangsbereich. irgendwann nach 5 minuten kam die nette bedienung wieder und brachte uns pflaumenwein, um die wartezeit zu versüßen. sehr nett. und weitere fünf minuten später war den tisch auch schon frei. ich bestellte hummerkrabben mit scharfen thai soße, gemüse und reis. mein schatz hatte das selbe nur mit ente. das essen war im nullkommanix da, es war sehr lecker und ausreichend. so gern ich nachtisch bestellt hätte, es hätte mich platzen lassen. zwischendurch kam die nette bedienung und fragte ob alles in ordnung sei und lächlte freundlich in ihrer zu der wandfarbe abgestimmtes outfit in lila und flieder. wir bezahlten für essen und 2 großen apfelschorle 28 euro und bekam glatt noch einen pflaumenwein zum abschied. ich empfand den abend im mang so spontan und ungeplant er war, extrem gut, aufmerksam und überrasschend. selten daß ich mich so wohl und betüttelt gefühlt hab wie hier und daß obwohl wir auf eine tisch warten mußten. ich gebe einen punkt für essen und trinken, einen fürs ambiente, einen für aufmerksamkeit und willkommensgefühl, einen für die supernette bedienung und einen für preisleistung. rundumzufrieden also. karte habe ich mir geben lassen, ab sofort wird reserviert.~thai ~5
3GZ4bsAp15Cn75ZaiLZNOw~m4wkMbHamju1TbMcdebfiw~Ich bin das Risiko eingegangen und habe meine Lieblingsmahlzeit vom Thailänder mit einer ähnlichen Zusammenstellung bei diesem Restaurant probiert.  Meine Bestellung:  Rote Curry Soße mit Rind, Gemüsekombination des Hauses und Reis als Beilage.   Kostenfaktor: 13,50 € - ein hoher preis für den ersten Eindruck der Menge des Gerichts. Jedoch ist der Preis bei meinem lieblings Thai fast der gleiche.  Nach dem Essen kann ich sagen, dass ich normal bis gut gesättigt war. Also ist die Menge ausreichend. Positiv überrascht war ich vom Chilli, den ich mir extra dazu bestellt hatte. Gute Schärfe ohne Beigeschmack wie z.B. beim Sambal Olek oder ähnliche scharfe Soßen, die man bei Asiaten aus dem Spender bekommt.  An sich war das Essen gut, jedoch kommt die Soße und somit das ganze Gericht nicht ganz an die fünf Sterne vom "Thai Garden" in Schorndorf (20 min. von Waiblingen).  Als Variante ganz gut aber nicht das Beste für schleckige Feinschmecker der Asiatischen Küche.  p.s.: Schick eingerichtetes Restaurant.~thai thai ~3

The roma tomatoes weren't as clean and red-looking like back home.  These had some brown spots.  Everything was in stock.  I had no issues of looking for something and it wasn't there.  There wasn't a lot of Chobani flip choices but that's okay at the time because I only needed a few  Feeling indifferent about the rice pudding I purchased last night (4/10) and it says best eaten by 4/12.

The wraps are really decent and there is a variety of choices.  It's difficult to choose a favourite.   Booster bakes are worth a try..    Mostly here for the smoothies of course..  I will either choose 'Bananas a-whey' or 'Pomegranate punch'.  Limited to salads and grains..  Maybe it differs from locations?   Some people say it's not worth the money to pay that much for a smoothie but I beg to differ.    Service for this location is relatively fast and consistent.  I would have never discovered Booster Juice if it weren't for this location at work.~wraps smoothies pomegranate salads smoothie ~5

-Yev39gkAEJ-l4XX9gpbdw~3L98pKh42PbVjLPcuTtV6w~Booster Juice near F57-61 terminal 1 is a really good deal. I didn't realize that their juice is so filling so I ordered a combo with steak panini. I thought the panini will not be a tasty choice but it turns out to be the opposite! It's fairly good warm panini given the limited choice in the airport. Love it!

7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~25ggBH5ghfErlNCA-tjGrQ~My favorite carribean Restuarant in Phoenix. Ms Martha always holds it down with the food. Pricey but definitely worth it with the generous portions. Patty & coco bread are a nice start if you're unsure of what to get. Jerk wings and ribs are to die for!! I'm here like once a week and I've yet to be disappointed!~patty & ribs ~5
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~pLJsgn_NxWAGHvuxNhXYKQ~So delighted to find a Caribbean grocery store and kitchen in the West valley. I came across an ad for this place a few days ago at my hairdresser and went to try it today. I was like a kid going up and down the aisles, putting hard to find items like salt fish, sorrel, kola champagne, jerk seasoning, plantain chips and ovaltine biscuits into my basket. It was such a treat to find Caribbean groceries that I had to order online before I knew of Caribbean Market Place. It is a small store but take your time going through...I was surpised at the selection.  After chatting with the lady who rang me up, I learned that the Caribbean Market Place grocery store has been there for 6 years, but they recently opened the kitchen which is adjacent. There are a couple of tables inside and outside, but we opted for an order to go. A generous plate of curry chicken, rice and peas and plantains was $10, oxtail stew with the same sides was $13. VERY good meal! My curry chicken was enough for lunch and dinner...my Dad enjoyed his oxtail with plantains.  We will definitely be back!~plantain chips chicken, peas chicken ~5
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~wNszW2oNgxzun9_JBTqlDg~I went in on a Saturday afternoon for the first time and as soon as I walked in the door there was a line. I took that as a good sign because the food must be real good if people are willing to wait. I ended up waiting more than 15 - 20 minutes by the time my order was taken; which was okay because I wasn't in a rush. I was just happy to finally get my hands on some Jamaican food again being that it's so scarce out here. I ordered a plate of oxtails, rice and peas with plantains. First thing that surprised me was the price, $15 for the plate and a bottled drink was $2.25. But, I didn't worry about that since I was hungry and looking forward to eating some real food. Well, by the time I sat down to eat it was a bit underwhelming. Being that I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY I have had many plates of Jamaican food in my lifetime and this one just didn't quite cut it for me. The portion size was good, but it just wasn't as tasty as the previous reviews made it out to seem. It's possible that this was just an off day so I may go back and try one of their other dishes.~peas ~3
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~txtaEZvmNU4FFO1WUyZAAA~Lo and behold, all this time I've been spelling Caribbean wrong.  No wonder I can never find it!  It's 1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  Okay -   If you find yourself straying westward one afternoon, stop for lunch at the Caribbean Marketplace on 44th Av & W Northern.  The restaurant is expanding to include more dining space.  I am rooting for it's success.  With expansion, I'm hoping to see more organization and a better use of the displays.   Overall friendly atmosphere; nice ambiance in the restaurant with music to keep rhythm to.  I'm fond of the tall wood tables and chairs.  They add class to the cheap looking tile floor.  The grill outside was hot, but empty so I presume they only grill upon order.   The grocery store is small with a few packed aisles.  I saw a bit of everything.  If you need something - ask.  Numerous folks came through to pick up one or two things or just out of curiosity, so this spot is pulling in a good crowd.   Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, I was happy to have a tall serving of homemade sorrel.  Oh yes, yes, that takes me back....Prepared to wait for the snapper (made to order) I also enjoyed a veggie patty of corn, carrots, and cabbage.  It was the classic veggie patty that I remembered from my other life.    What I wasn't happy about was the lack of green vegetation on the menu.  Oxtails, chicken, goat, patties (beef, chicken, veggie), coco bread, plantains (way too oily!), rices & peas, pasta salad, and potato salad were readily available.  Where were the greens, callaloo, okra?  Nonetheless, my order of snapper was beautifully prepared with bell peppers and onions.  Yummy.  The cook allowed the veggies to flavor the dish and did not rely on a heavy hand of salt.  I will def come to the Caribbean (1 R, 2 B's) Marketplace again and I do recommend that you stop by too.    Call ahead 623-930-5258 to see what else the cook can prepare.~patty corn, cabbage. patty chicken, beef, chicken, peas, pasta salad ~4

Let me know start, the place is located in a small strip mall and wasn't hard to find with my GPS.  The sign outside was large enough to see from far.   Parking is more than generous.  The outside of the establishment is clean.    As you enter, I was greeted by the friendly employees.  On the left is the grocery side and on the right is the restaurant side with some tables and chairs for eating.  On this particular visit, we found everything we were looking for that couldn't be found at any local grocery store, Walmart, or Target.  We picked up curry and saffron powder, cooking butter, a soft drink called 'Solo', poulourie mix, and a jar of mango chutney all produced in our homeland - Trinidad and all reasonably priced may I add!  While we were there, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat so I ordered the regular curry goat which comes with 2 sides so I chose the rice and beans along with the fried plantains which was very tasty and served hot!  Thankfully the curry goat wasn't too spicy.  The regular is $`13 and was enough for two or maybe if you leave any leftovers, it can go for dinner tonight but I consumed it all. One of the food items we came for was roti but they were out but will be retuning in a couple days for it....it's a must have!  We were really pleased to have found this place through the internet and Yelp and seeing as they carry many of the products that are so hard to find in our local neighborhood markets and groceries, we will definitely be returning, not just for that roti, but for many other grocery items!~butter, mango ~5
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~bJTZNht3CCBqn4NukgMlBg~Regular customers in the market section for grocery items since this store first opened for business. We  decided to feed our faces, we ordered the curry goat, stewed chicken and oxtail. The food was finger licking good. "Di food irie mon"~chicken ~5
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~CBDEYSA_WJsQKrgpVsdH6w~Brown stew chicken was MWAH! Wanted to kiss the cook, but that would be innapropriate ;)  I went late at night so I wasn't expecting the food to be fresh but it was flavorful, the sauce was rich and the sides were sweet in contrast to the fire of the spices.  Nice array of west indian spices and seasonings in the store as well.  Will be back!~brown chicken ~5
7s8ripk5sBM4psK_Za5GyQ~2-dcbnuDP7u1Q2rx6TW4Ng~I love the food here. I live 30 mi away but I try to go every week. Authentic food made fresh. You can eat in or get in to go. Jerk chicken, jerk ribs, curry goat, oxtails, patties (beef, chicken and veggie) and much more. Their prices are reasonable.~chicken, ribs, beef, chicken ~5
9cYuHvnoPhm1UpLvHvoWWw~AeRrneS6UOovzVSp5yO0sw~It is open on sunday.  It has stuff in it.  The fruitcups were good.  I got a premade "Italian" sandwich.  Which I regreted buying almost as soon as I walked out the store.  I dobnt know what else to say about this place.~sandwich. ~2
9cYuHvnoPhm1UpLvHvoWWw~sdXuvEiaUJ_0PsfGzFrlrQ~Attached to the Doubletree hotel.  They have the items you would expect: popcorn, ice cream, frozen meals, sandwiches, coffee, bottled or fountain soda, milk, ice tea, energy drinks.  They also have a decent variety of packaged snacks.  Staff is very friendly.    Prices are average convenient store prices.  They don't take AXP cards.  You can get hot dogs but I wouldn't trust them.~popcorn, ice cream, sandwiches, coffee, milk, tea, hot dogs ~3
9cYuHvnoPhm1UpLvHvoWWw~MRLfv1wJzAU1YiG9PT82ug~6-11.     That's what this should be called because on weekdays those are the hours it's open.    This is a super convenient place if you're staying at the DoubleTree and they have a ton of food, snacks, drinks available to satisfy nearly every urge.  It seemed like this one guy was working every time I went in and he was very cool, friendly and professional.  The place is pretty clean, although there is always cheese residue on the nachos machine, which just sort of looks gross.  I can't bump this up to four stars because they do not have seltzer or club soda.  I need my fizzy water and it drives me nuts I can't get it at convenience stores outside of NYC.  But overall, this place is good.  Thanks for letting me give you the 411 on this 7-11.~cheese nachos ~3
9cYuHvnoPhm1UpLvHvoWWw~4BoqV6UF3zr0XhJF-kraBQ~The store itself was fine- had things I needed but this if this were a review for 7Elevens overall- they really, really, REALLY, suck.  Please. Please, do something about your coffee. Please. It tastes like mud water.~coffee. ~2
EdzXOtgk-XKiNgfFrfCYLg~lVE8SxyCW51852gzkvZopQ~It wasn't my first Nia class.  In fact, I'd done a lot of Nia with great teachers, and even took my white belt training (which at the time, was the teacher training) for Nia.  Nia is amazing, and each teacher brings their own energy to the practice.  In fact, if you have tried Nia and didn't love it, I recommend trying another teacher or more.  It's more about the right fit for you than it is about "good" and "bad" teachers.  So, Jenn Hicks.  She's amazing.  She's not shy about sharing her personal story online and the struggles that lead her to Nia.  She has a passion for mental health and celebrating the bodies we have.  Jenn understands and loves it when you take care of yourself, so there is no pressure to keep up or do anything that doesn't feel right.    If I need to slow a move down, or take a break, I know that Jenn respects and encourages that.  I feel like she creates a safe place where I can show up, as I am, and dance from there.  All of me is welcome here.  You can be gentle.  That said, if I wanted to pump things up and really work it, there is no one better than Jenn Hicks.  That girl has more energy than anyone I know.  She has a blast while she teaches and her enthusiasm is contagious.   If you want a great workout that rocks your cardio while being kind to your body, this is the class.  If I could describe her classes in two words, sexy and sweaty come to mind.  The kind of sexy that is barefoot and strong.  I often laugh out loud in her classes as well.  And I love the music she chooses.  It's all over the place, but always fun.  Jenn is super playful but don't be fooled -- that woman is a powerhouse of wisdom.  You'll be in good hands, and likely leave loving your body a little more.~white ~5
CVS4vhkO9oUH0oQ6iJucaw~Yy1dVI1sn8l2cBsECxJMAQ~Wenn ich in Weilimdorf und Umgebung unterwegs bin, ist der Baran Kebap einfach Pflicht! Superschneller Service (eingespieltes Team) und ein echt Super Döner und Yufka zu normalen Preisen. Pizza habe ich jetzt dort noch keine versucht, was ich aber bestimmt mal bei einem meinen nächsten Abstecher nachholen werde. Also ich kann diese Dönerbude (ist eingentlich falsch, da es überhaupt nichts mit einer Bude zu tun hat) nur empfehlen! Lecker Lecker!~pizza ~5
CVS4vhkO9oUH0oQ6iJucaw~lmoOgaEGGyU1iqa9Av9q1w~Hier liegen 2 Dönergaststätten nebeneinander. Aber nur die Baran Kebap Gaststätte ist stets sehr gut besucht. Die Portionen sind immer riesig und super frisch. Es gibt hier einfach kein altes Fleisch. Auch der Salat, die Tomaten etc. immer super lecker. Wenn man mal keinen Hunger auf Döner hat, bekommt man hier auch eine klasse Pizza. Der Pizza-Lieferdienst hat bei uns schon lange ausgedient.  Die Bedienung ist immer nett und freundlich. Leider sind häufiger mal die Plätze im Nichtraucher-Bereich komplett belegt, so dass man auf den Raucherbereich ausweichen muss. Aber dafür können die Inhaber ja auch nichts, dass sie so gut besucht sind. Für die Qualität spricht auch, dass die Polizei regelmässig in dem Laden ist, nicht zur Kontrolle oder so, sondern um Großbestellungen abzuholen. Alles in allem, es ist der einzige Ort wo ich jetzt noch Döner esse.~pizza pizza ~5
BH30SUqfbOlhGpncCsONKg~bdUh5kN6_giLkwiT-hfTMw~Vegan food is a beast that is hard to tame, as variety is sometimes missing or taste finds itself lacking. As a meat eater myself, it took some convincing by my wife to try O'Bol, which is a 100% vegan restaurant with no animal products whatsoever.  After tasting their Californian salad however, I was truly impressed! The blend of vegetables with "simulated" chicken strips that tasted so much better than some real meat strips, topped with a peanut sauce that marries itself so well to the Asian flavours... It was a piece of heaven!  I've returned only once since then as it's out of my regular way and tucked in the Bonaventure Plaza's food court, but just writing this review right now makes me crave for more.   If you're a vegan that has trouble eating out with those damned meat lovers because they hate your food, this place will change their mind.~salad chicken ~5
BH30SUqfbOlhGpncCsONKg~NLQnEAOKhaXUWCUV4FyxOg~I just read the last review about O'Bol and then snuck out of the office and headed over there, looking for a healthy-ish meal. I'm not vegan, but I've always been a sucker for simulated meats. You can imagine how shocked I was when I got there and saw things like ROAST CHICKEN LEG and MEATBALLS on the menu. Talk about doing a complete 180 on your original concept.  But since I went all the way over there, and nothing else in that food court appealed to me, and I'm not even vegan and therefore have no dietary restrictions, I decided that I was going to eat O'Bol anyway.  I went with the french chicken (I think that's what it was called), which was basically a chicken stew with peas and squash, served in a bowl over rice and roasted potatoes. I also had a squash soup. The verdict? It was pretty good for a food court kiosque, and even though it wasn't what I was expecting, I wasn't really disappointed. It's kind of nice to eat something relatively healthy in a food court (and I mean that in comparison to all the other very greasy and oily things you might be forced to eat in this kind of setting).  It's probably about as homey as you can get in a food court.  Anyway, I think I've gone past the legal limit of the amount of times you can repeat the term "food court" in one review, so I'll stop here. But if you're near Bonaventure, and the idea of deciding which mediocre lunch option will leave you the least depressed, do head on over to O'Bol.~chicken meatballs chicken ( chicken peas potatoes. soup. ~3
BH30SUqfbOlhGpncCsONKg~nf42cIyoLFpazDtsyIGSCQ~Not all food courts are build the same. Like this one. Independent fronts like Obol serve up heaping plates. While they do have vegetarian options, the two lunch options that were suggested to me were both beef.   I opted for "The tex mex:" chili on rice. Make no mistake, it ain't pretty. Think cafeteria gruel heaped on a paper plate. But all looks aside, it packs some taste!  Would I seek it out or crave it? Nah, but if I were in the area, say, for a beer festival, I'd definitely pad my stomach with this!~beef. ~4
3r2e67holZG6QjiWnKxqjg~m2_z0wCtSTTPFK1xmIkk9A~This teensy place is located on a forlorn part of the strip; you know, that stretch bridging New Vegas and Old Vegas that is adorned only by low-lying cheap T-shirt and souvenir warehouses...the part that reminds  you that you are in the bone dry desert.  As my friends and I (all of still us hungover at 4 p.m.) walked under the daze of the mid-afternoon sun, coffee seemed like a necessity and SexxPresso seemed like just the quirky (and indeed only) thing we needed.  Tittering, we perused a small wall of shabby nylon lingerie, patent leather (a.k.a. cheap vinyl) bondage gear, and glow-in-the-dark dildos before walking up to the counter, where a scruffy, middle-aged, not unobese guy in a yellowed white tee (or was it a wifebeater) greeted us.   Bemoaning the state of the economy and the prudence of Vegas tourists nowadays, he took our orders. Behind him, a hipless bottle blonde who looked like she was 12 years old (this is not to imply that the employees at this business are not of age; she just looked that way for sure) fumbled her way around the machinery, ultimately producing our steaming cups with downcast eyes and a flourish of limp synthetic lace.  I forget the name of what I ordered, but I guarantee you that the title was unironically smutty. Back in the daylight, I took an awkward and slightly guilty gulp of cherry-infused mocha. There was nothing wrong with the temperature or the quality of it, but for some reason, I kept thinking about flavored lube and worrying that it was the secret ingredient. Right then, my cocky male coffee connoisseur friend, the only one who could have potentially enjoyed this whole scene, aptly expressed everyone's feelings - "BLAAAAAGH! You CAN'T mix SEX with COFFEE, man...now all I feel like is that I'm drinking that 12-year-old girl's ASSSSS...tasting her ASSSSSS...."  We walked the rest of the way in depressed silence and got our blood flowing with the Stratosphere rides instead. I want to wish this severely undervisited place luck, but unfortunately, a coffee-cum-sex-shop is not neither a turnon nor a picker-upper, especially not on the dead part of the Vegas strip.~coffee white cherry- coffee coffee, coffee- ~2
3r2e67holZG6QjiWnKxqjg~uMfl7c59pri8svAN5njnYA~With a name like Sexxpresso I was expecting the Hooter's version of coffee.  I got the Hooter's part but the coffee was horrible.  Espresso was somewhere between burnt and rancid.  Blech.  It'll take more than Hooter's to get me back.  I don't care what the schtick is, you've got to have decent coffee.  Blech.  Blech.  Blah.  Yadda.  Yadda.  Yadda.~coffee. coffee coffee. ~1
3r2e67holZG6QjiWnKxqjg~_bGdMu-Xd8gtHXfG1h-ubg~Possibly one of the most unusual places i've been to.  My tuxedo rental place was "close" to here so we stopped by a couple times for coffee.  The baristas are in bikinis...so yeah it's a bikini coffee shop. The girls were very nice and complimentary.  I'd say a step above Rock of Love material.  If you can make me good coffee you could wear 3 parkas for all it's worth.  But alas, the coffee was mediocre.  My friend ordered the Erotic Pleasure, which was white chocolate mocha, and he seemed to enjoy it...but my coffee was bland.  And once i purchased it, she forgot to make it.  I paid for it, then watched her forget to pour it out for me.  I was in disbelief.   The size of your coffee is either B or DD.  It took me a minute to understand that.  I swear I stopped by b/c i heard they had good coffee!~coffee. coffee coffee coffee white coffee coffee coffee! ~2
3r2e67holZG6QjiWnKxqjg~bj6HJ6Zq1JfY0SQFdcJW8A~OK, first of all:  THEY MOVED.  No longer located on Flamingo, they are now located right on the Strip.  Secondly, the store was populated (the one time I was there) by two ditzy blondes who -- when you add them together -- MAY have had a two-digit IQ, and a brunette who was either smart enough not to open her mouth or dumb enough not to know she was supposed to talk to customers.  Oh, yeah, and there was a old(er) guy with salt-and-pepper hair (and a beard to match) who actually had to make the drinks, because the scantily-clad girls (one in a bustier and garter belt, one in a baby doll, and one in a bra and panties -- don't they know steamed milk can be HOT???) didn't know how to make a straight espresso, let alone something as complicated as a latte!  (OK, I answered my own question:  no, they DIDN'T realize steamed milk was hot -- they never touch the equipment!)  Two stars because the espresso was indeed better than Starbuck's.  Minus one star because there is no one there with enough intelligence to count out correct change without having someone help them.  Add one star because the girls were cute, in a really creepy, Humbert Humbert-and-Lolita, "only in Vegas" sort of way.    And I swear I really DID go for the coffee . . . it was recommended on the yelp! Vegas talk page!~milk milk coffee . ~2
CvWSPgrEMDwLMJOrD3WLVQ~Wo9N1_jXzxgzBEFyFI8fzg~Mmmm! Yummmmmy! My friend and I were going to hit an a la cart but then found this AYCE gem on college! Delicious is the word to describe everything that came out of the kitchen and from the sushi bar. Great service and very friendly! I know it's a little thing but the miso came out nice and hot, not warm like most places. Nothin like a hot served soup on a cool evening. I highly recommend Magic Sushi!~sushi miso soup sushi! ~5
CvWSPgrEMDwLMJOrD3WLVQ~kW1q2-SViLzbUy4E3lBOiA~Sashimi Island is a much better AYCE option. Sushi bon is probably similar but much nicer staff and ambiance.   Comparable with Sushi D which isn't saying much.~sushi sushi ~2
CvWSPgrEMDwLMJOrD3WLVQ~Q2Z66B5cOacPVb-0wOCNNA~I went here tonight with a group of 9 people and they were very accommodating. Food came out quick, was fresh and delicious. The beef tataki was awesome. We must of had at least 30 pieces. Mango rolls, green dragon and short ribs were perfect. Considering they just opened they are better than many others in the area.~beef mango ribs ~5
CvWSPgrEMDwLMJOrD3WLVQ~aho4lTtBxPVGkajlZ07DTA~I got takeout from Magic Sushi from the first time over the weekend. The food was fine and they had the standard sushi restaurant vegetarian options.  However, I could not imagine going here for a sit-down meal, especially during the day. The place barely gets any sunlight (weirdly, they've blocked off one window with a folding screen) and the interior is dark and depressing. They've made it worse by decorating with lots of black.~sushi sushi ~3
CvWSPgrEMDwLMJOrD3WLVQ~-qQ9K51P6Bk9LsElQ9nWDA~this place gets 2 stars for the mere fact that i didn't get food poisoning. i got a lunch special and it was pretty underwhelming. see the salad pictured above. it felt like an insult and a joke. the rest was, uh, just OK. point is that there is 4 other sushi restaurants on the block that do the same or better and i suggest you try one of those first.  also the place looks like some reject set from Blade Runner~salad sushi ~2

5CvVtsSkgyXI4dh0LVIltw~bUJICYPJyNiDx98p-Lw60g~A bit nicer than most places on Queen's West, and also a bit more expensive.  You can offset that cost by sticking with the pizzas, which are all $15 and a decent size for two people.    They have an extensive cocktail list organized by liquor and then separated into Sweet/Sour/Savory/Bitter with a few drinks in each category.    I got the Dirty Gin, which was quite good, although I would have skipped it had I known it was going to be $13.  Too much for a cocktail.  My girl and I had the Golden Pizza, which was so amazing we got the Pork Belly w/ arugula pizza to go.  Both were fantastic.  Also had the root veggie "fries," which are really more fresh root veggie chips, but amazing all the same.  The place is quiet pleasant, and they were very friendly and accomodating, checking if we wanted the door closed, saying we could sit anywhere we wanted, and turning down the music when we asked (it was just a touch too loud).  Overall, highly recommended.  Only warning is the high price of cocktails. The $11 glass of Malbec/Syrah was much more satisfying.~pizza pork arugula pizza fries, chips, ~4
5CvVtsSkgyXI4dh0LVIltw~jO2RAdG99Cu_odeOHQV6mw~We came to lucid for a friends birthday. We were interested in seeing the cocktail menu and having some dinner. The place was empty (9pm on a Friday night) which contributed to the chilly uncomfortable atmosphere.  When we went to order, they had "sold out" of half their menu items... Which had limited choice to begin with and we were only told of this after we ordered. My steak came out cold, the sides were boring and the "amazing tartare" was less than impressive.  The cocktails were OK, I def wouldn't go back for them. If you want true delicious and interesting cocktails made by a true chef and delivered by staff who know the menu inside and out, I recommend you go to Toronto's true cocktail lounge Barchef (which interesting enough is right across the street). I give this place a 2/5 for the service, atmosphere, food and drinks. Overall, not impressed in the slightest.~steak ~2
5CvVtsSkgyXI4dh0LVIltw~DsdaM9MtJnAJv00XT8PVnw~I really wanted to like this place more And as much as I would really like to say that it was OK, which it technically was... I have experienced  better, so let's give this 2.75 rounded down.  Maybe it was the atmosphere, quiet on a week night, no great atmosphere or lively vibe, felt like there were more servers watching than serving with patrons coming in and out from time to time. There is actually a larger dining room at the end of a narrow corridor, which was.... empty.  Drinks start at $13, and they are tasty, well crafted, with much time and effort. They do not list the prices on the menu and I'm guessing the fancier ones do come at an even steeper cost. but I'm not good with names, so I wouldn't even know which ones are for the high rollers.  Their menu comes in a few categories, starting with "bite size" snacks, which 2/3 were sold out at the time. There are salads flatbreads and a few mains to add to it, and specials rhymed off by the waitor. The special was a fish (can't remember what), with apple and horseradish puree and root veg. Sounded enticing enough as the flavours seemed bold and interesting. When it came out, I must have misinterpretted that the horshradish came separately but it must have been mixed in with the apple puree, which really tasted like applesauce, no horse radish evident. The root vegetables were bright and beautiful, but it had no flavour to it. The fish was small sear, and for the same price, I had two fillets at Gusto 101. I thought it was a little too salty, and overcooked. Overall, not impressed with the price or quality.  My friends who got the carbonara with light cream sauce thought it was okay, but the portions looked a little small. The vegetarian flat bread, at first looked like sausage, but in fact wasn't and tasted nothing like I thought - much too salty than preferred.   It is always because of good company that I will stay at a sub-par restaurant for 3 hours. I wouldn't mind coming for a late night drink if other places were packed, but I felt this environment was a little too stuffy for me.  YAY to girls night :)~salads apple horseradish apple radish carbonara sausage, ~2
4s-eHLQcoMqAgfzbiQsKIw~Nu3FkGRBXKwnmX17LYvsiQ~The pizza is not as bad as some people make it sound. yes its sweet and not a traditional pizza crust, but when its hot its tasty. Its not a traditional Italian pizza, but then most of the pizza you find in Cleveland is not authentic by any stretch of the imagination. Since most Clevelanders adore Pizza Hut and Papa John's chains, I can't understand why Rascal House supposedly serves such garbage? but on a more serious note, the place is not very clean. the mens room smells like a medley of bodily fluids and the tables can be greasy. I've never gotten sick from here, unlike some other pizza places in the city.~pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza ~3
4s-eHLQcoMqAgfzbiQsKIw~V3MgVW4ymEeW77DVtbmeaw~I had always passed by Rascal house near CSU and never tried it because it looked like a typical college pizza place.   Finally, I had a chance to eat their take out pizza and turns out it is a typical college student favorite cheap pizza place with lots of coupons!   That doesn't mean it is a bad place or the food is not great. A place like this is caters to college students who have no time to cook between their hangovers and dinner dates! I have ate at places like this in my college days and suffice to say that was never about the pizza but who you shared it with!~pizza pizza pizza pizza ~3

I genuinely like their white pizza, which we've ordered a couple times for lunch in the past two weeks. Each time the pizza tasted different. One more garlicy than the other, but still delicioso. The delivery time was pretty decent, especially since we ordered during the major lunch rush.~pizza white pizza pizza ~3

4s-eHLQcoMqAgfzbiQsKIw~c3vYwO5OVFVhoUV3zZbnJA~After searching for a pizza place around downtown Cleveland on Memorial day weekend, Rascal's was the only place open. I was leary after reading all of the negetive reviews, but to my surprise the food was good.   The crust on our pizza was crunchy and the garlic bread portion was larger than expected.  The delivery time was quicker than expected as well.   A good mid level pizza, I would rate it as a step above Dominoe's, Pizza Hut and the like. So if the kids want pizza this is a good choice!~pizza pizza garlic pizza pizza pizza ~3

4s-eHLQcoMqAgfzbiQsKIw~PNo5OEqwDuqW7Ro2mw_usw~What on earth was I thinking?   I know Rascal House pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings.  It was one of three places to eat on Euclid whilst I was taking my Bar Review at CSU (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars).  The other two were an Arby's and a scary greasy spoon.  So I ended up having at Rascal House more times than I care to count.  Imagine having to study for the most important test of your life AND having to eat bad pizza along with it.  The horror.  The horror.  I've had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches.  It has not improved.  So, here I am, back at CSU to take a few classes.  What to have for lunch.  I'm pretty sick of Subway.  Nothing at the school food service looks good today.  What to get?  A salad.  How hard can a salad be?  Surely Rascal House has a simple, tasty salad.  Most  pizza places do.  Swamp water.  That's what it tasted like.  The lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (I worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad.  I know how that works.)  The carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler.  The turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg.  Sad.  THEN, I had to eat it whilst listening to really bad, really loud 1980s top 40.   No Cure, no Depeche Mode.  1980s Hambone music.  I'm going out to find an insulated lunch bag.~pizza pizza salad. salad salad. pizza lettuce lettuce carrot cheese egg. ~1

Two topping pizza the other night was just this side of criminal. I would have happily returned to ask for money back but-for being hand cuffed to my kohler for several hours immediately following consumption. If you're desperate, maybe. If your stoned, absolutely. If you value your digestive system, no way no how.~pizza ~1
EMzpWGROM3-IPvcwfSEQPQ~TMp_m8JDmsLL6Q0XQAW8KA~Tasty pizza and friendly staff! My fiancé and I ordered two pizzas (napoletana and capriccio), one salad (rocket with pear and cheese), and one dessert (vanilla ice cream with coffee dressing). The pizzas were delicious; crispy and aromatic, thanks to the firewood, the slices are thin and savoury (a bit wet though, so you may want to fold your slices). The salad was also remarkable with fresh ingredients and lovely vinegar dressing. I love the dessert too! The coffee was of high quality and the vanilla ice cream was made from vanilla pods. I'm keen to go back again!~pizza salad ( pear cheese) ice cream coffee salad coffee ice cream ~5
EMzpWGROM3-IPvcwfSEQPQ~GFq7uSzGfSBB8nsXleC5Dg~We went today with the idea of sharing a pizza between 2, as a snack. Unfortunately the waitress told us that we couldn't share a pizza: 1 pizza per person, it's their policy. So we left. It was 5pm, the place was half empty, so we weren't occupying a space that could have been taken by another paying customer. The policy is completely illogical within the above circumstances, and for sure that's the wrong way to attract customers to a new place. I won't go back!~pizza pizza pizza ~1
EMzpWGROM3-IPvcwfSEQPQ~x3j8Rz41xbKJTdcDHLFGxw~It's a little bit hard to review pizza restaurants; if you are aiming a bit higher than Dominos and Pizza Hut and use an actual woodfire oven it's pretty hard to screw it up but it's also pretty hard to stand out.   Wildmanwood is as good as any of the pizza's I've had in the capital. I'm giving it the full 5 stars because I really liked it and I hope it does well.  I love the branding and the feel of the place. It feels modern, a bit hipster and especially in the midst of festival season it had a bit of a buzz. A lot of other pizza places go for a more rustic homely Italian feel, so I quite liked the contrast here.  It's not a huge venue and it's made up of long large tables - you will be sitting next to other dining companions. It's an informal and fun place, I'd come with some friends but it might not be ideal if you are planning an intimate romantic dinner.   The menu has a lot of good variety. A lot of other places have a lot of very similar sounding pizzas, whereas they was a good mix of tomato-based and white pizzas here with a variety of interesting toppings. I had 'The Donald' - with tallegio, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, sausage. I enjoyed it a lot and I definitely wanted to come back to try some of the other options. Washed it all down with one of my favourite beers, a Beavertown IPA. Pizzas were all around about the £10 mark.  It's reasonably priced, it's hip, it's fun, and the pizza is great. I will definitely be back.~pizza pizza pizza pizza tomato- white cherry broccoli, sausage. pizza ~5
EMzpWGROM3-IPvcwfSEQPQ~RVQlYxdS8fXSxElc8yWgUg~Enjoyed a great dinner here with a large group the other night. Always a good sign when 8 pizzas are completely devoured by the end of the meal!  Wildmanwood offers a nice range of Neapolitan-esque pizza in modern, open dining space. They also have both vegan and vegetarian friendly menu options. I recommend the pizza that comes with grilled courgette, pepper and goats cheese. I was excited to hear about the prosecco on tap, but I thought the price was a little high for the size of the glass. I opted for the Tempranillo instead which was lovely. For the quality of the pizza, I think the prices are fair, and the service was friendly and attentive. I think it's a great location, being so close to the university, and I hope the new restaurant does well!~pizza pizza cheese. pizza ~4
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~egN-7YtD9vAfOsSqdsGwlQ~I almost got sick on all of the chocolate coffee beans in this place, they are so good.  I sat outside and had a great conversation about the direction music is taking in this day in age.  If you don't follow a formula it seems that you can't get a record contract, even in the indie scene.  As you can tell, I thoroughly enjoyed the crowd here.    Inside there is a bar opposite the coffee line with Creative Loafing and other local newspapers to read, as well as chocolate coffee beans in little quarter machines.  Don't mix these with a strong cup of coffee or you will be jumping off the walls.~coffee coffee coffee coffee ~3
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~1rvre2ib6ahlx9JMXMakzA~I wrote a book at Coffeeworks, or at least a good chunk of one. It's a great place to hang out and work. I usually hang out here on Saturdays before a standing 6:00 date, so I know the place well.  Sometimes, there are lots of angsty, purple-haired teens hanging around the place, and occasionally there have been old farty-types arguing loudly about politics...but other than the sometimes unpleasant noise, it tends to be a pretty laid-back shop.   Their smoothies are delicious, and the coffee is good. I agree with Garrett G that the chocolate coffee beans are indeed delicious and sickening. The music is just loud enough to hear, but not so loud that you can't think.  They have a decent selection of things to eat. It's not a place for lunch or anything, but they have the standard coffee-shop style foods you'd expect...biscotti (Try the grasshopper mint!) and muffins and scones and other pastries.~date, smoothies coffee coffee coffee- pastries. ~4
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~T1ZI-H9KV9A-9pKfZei2JA~We LOVE CoffeeWorks - they roast their own beans at a warehouse in Matthews and have a terrific selection of different roasts.  They also have a frequent buyers club so you can get a free lb of coffee after making x number of purchases.   Most of the people who work here are pretty educated about the various roasts and most are very helpful.  2011 Update -- Sadly, this is now closed. I understand they are still roasting coffeebeans at their warehouse in Matthews. I have heard that the Ben & Jerry's in the Arbo is selling CoffeeWorks coffee.~coffee coffee. ~4
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~d3nYIMDDtSbdRfIXpxxPPQ~We popped into CoffeeWorks on a dreary, overcast day and were greeted by a friendly woman behind the counter.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had flavored coffee!   Other than my favorite coffee chain (Barnie's Coffee, which is slowly closing each and every store), nobody seems to offer flavored coffee.  Unless you go to a convenience store attached to a gas station (what's up with that anyway?).  Starbucks and Caribou only offer different coffees like dark or light roast.  Nothing else.  I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day.  I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag.  The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too.  My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups.  Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees!); we'll be back!~coffee! coffee coffee, coffee. coffee coffee coffee ~4
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~3-XTiQXGZ5lZd4Tahl72RQ~Really good coffee--get it in a mug to drink there. Small enough to listen to other people's conversations, if you like that sort of thing. Lovely aroma.   Decent atmosphere. Bit drafty on a cold day (door would kind of blow open, if I recall correctly), so I usually kept my jacket on when I went.  Lots of people meeting friends or working on laptops. Wifi available.   Here's my tiny beef with them:  I went there as someone freshly moved into the city, after a grueling four-day trip through the snow over Christmas break with 4 kids, 3 pets, and 2 vehicles.   I really would have loved a friendly face who remembered me and made me feel like the frequent customer I was for a week or two. I mean, I was there on almost a daily basis, since our moving truck (with my coffee maker hidden WAY in the back under EVERYTHING) had not arrived.    They just weren't feeling chatty, I guess.   Still, the coffee was great.  Parking sometimes hard to find nearby.   So, go have some wonderful coffee in a warm mug. Bring a friend. :-)~coffee-- beef coffee coffee coffee ~3
F1tOtPzcsQk8PqNOatVsCg~O6WevGqmzfBRbfqf0TDzrQ~Small area.  Drab atmosphere.  Very dark inside.  Hard place to have a private conversation.  The coffee is great though. So get the coffee and go elsewhere.~coffee coffee ~4

9uc0douRsVpb4J0ET4ti5g~pkrKvZfb-v0gmqaaQBQloQ~The Potterrow shop can be found within the University of Edinburgh's Potterrow building.  It is essentially for the use of the students, and comes with all of the student essentials - stationery, food and drink, newspapers and magazines, as well as a large range of university-branded gifts.  Some of the best things about this shops are its deals.  The student deals here are great - one example is the £3 meal deal that includes a sandwich, crisps and drink.  It tends to be the place where I get my stationery from, purely because of its convenient location in the heart of the university campus.  If you need a new biro, or fancy sporting some university clothing, then visit the Potterrow shop - more or less a one-stop shop.~sandwich, ~4
9uc0douRsVpb4J0ET4ti5g~EPfih2INoMTteG1ZJJ2-XQ~Inside the glorious student union of Potterrow is the EUSA student shop. This EUSA shop is the biggest of all EUSA shops and not surprisingly the most popular. During term time, this shop is mobbed when lunch time comes along!   If you want to pick up a quick sandwich and a drink then Potterrow stores a vast range of sandwiches, wraps and ginsters pastries! With great deals on every week, students can save a lot of money coming here for lunch rather than going somewhere else. And what I love about it is that it must stock the biggest variety of flapjacks I have ever seen in a shop!   Apart from the food and drink, newspapers and a wide selection of stationary products are available, with great deals on pads of paper (essential for any eager student!). If you're however, even eager to be the complete student then a wide range of Edinburgh University branded clothing is just waiting to be bought by you! Come on, you know you want to buy that school scarf or Uni hoody!~sandwich sandwiches, wraps pastries! ~4
7ZPMngvH89iNF0RzFiIEqw~0760u8XJ8GsxkE654VI5QA~I always feel the need to look around me when I get in and out of my car here, even in broad daylight. I don't know what it is about this intersection, but the amount of guys who look like K-Fed before he became K-Fat, trying to holla right at the doors of this place, is both strong and unsettling.   This store is dingy looking and has the nastiest smell of dried spit when you walk in. It's just gross. I wish this place would just have a quick power wash and this place would be good to go.  Selection is okay. Don't expect slushie type drinks of any kind. Coffee drinks are cheap and prices aren't too terrible, but eh, I really don't like stopping in here.~coffee ~2
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~qn9G-u1LV4fkr-vqd2T6Dw~We went here on vacation. The hotel concierge said the food would be good, not a party in your mouth (his actual words). It was close to the hotel. The food was ok Italian, not great but ok. The service was very slow on a slow business night. We decided to have dessert, a shot of Frangelico and coffee. First the alcohol was wrong Limoncello. Big difference on all counts. They fixed that. The dessert was good. The coffee was so bad we couldn't drink it. Not the way you want a meal to end.  I wouldn't go back there when there are better choices.~coffee. coffee ~3
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~pIX9grtkE5kXtEMg7VwYrA~Although The food took lilke 30 mins to get to us, it was amazing! I ordered the chicken with some pasta and it was delicious! Love this place ;)~chicken pasta ~5
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~ddUSyZFPxGaEGxZNPVwemg~We went there to celebrate a colleague's thesis defense and we were around 10 people. The food was plentiful and delightful. Most of us ordered the table d'hôte (in some of the several different options) and we all ended up being quite full. Pretty good wine as well!  The waiters are very polite and trilingual, and they gave us bread at the beginning and fruit at the end. As it is usual in restaurants of this caliber, they made sure we had Parmesan and pepper at will.  I ordered an Osso Bucco and some of my friends were quite jealous. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture, but I can attach my friends succulent Smoked Salmon Salad.~smoked salmon ~5
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~-XE5s9cGTwO5q-8u9G3i6Q~Along with the complimentary bread, you get a nice bruschetta.  The menu has a nice selection of lamb, poultry, seafood, veal, and pasta dishes  I tried the gamberi provenciale.  The large shrimp were sauteed in a lemon, butter, herb, and garlic sauce.  It came with vegetable and rice side dishes.~lamb, pasta shrimp lemon, butter, garlic ~4
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~VtmHPCoNgJPowpy1ZqGEzA~My husband and I took our two kids here for dinner. The bread and bruschetta while we were waiting were delicious. There was no kids menu but the staff were very accommodating in serving half portions for them. The staff were very friendly and answered a number of questions about the menu, both in French and English. The pasta was fresh and delicious, and both the stuffed veal and the chicken Marsala were great. The portions were large and we all left full and satisfied. We also loved the house white wine.~pasta chicken white ~4
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~uQoT6ZTdZsw89wfo2RmZ8A~Went here on the recommendation of our hotel. From the outside, it's very unassuming - it's on the ground floor corner of a corporate building. Inside, it looks like a cute Italian restaurant. We went a little late so it wasn't too busy. Went with my wife and 2 teen kids. In short, the service was excellent - the waiters were clearly trilingual and they treated us like we were in their home. We all order an entree.  But first there was the bread.  Expected and good.  Unexpected was the complimentary bruschetta that was clearly recently made. The entrees were good.  A bit heavy on the salt, but all very flavorful.  The linguine was in red clam sauce on the menu, but they were happy to change it to white sauce.  It was huge and very tasty.  I had the penne romanoff which was basically ala vodka. We also had the chicken marsala and the fettucine caprese.  Everything is what you'd expect as textbook Italian food.  Afterwards, since we ate everything we got, we declined dessert. But, they gave us complimentary fruit and nuts in the shell - had fun cracking open a few.  All in all, a solid Italian eatery in Montreal.~white chicken ~4
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~9VpB93kFR1BjOL0uOSgLGg~This restaurant is rather delightful. While there seemed to be some backlog at the entryway, the general decor and ambiance makes this establishment feel classy. The tables are done well, the waiters (I decline to use the word 'servers' here on purpose) are attentive, and cooperative - this translates to better table side service. The wine menu is pleasant, and they serve free bruschetta. Their bread is also really soft, and served warm - pretty decent table balsamic vinegar. We both ordered pasta, and again, while the service time was a bit long (20 mins for a main dish), we were distracted by the appetizers. The restaurant also delivers on menu ingredients as listed for the dishes (lots of clams, bacon/ham, mushrooms, etc - none of the pretentiousness followed by a paltry portion). The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff. In all, it was a great experience. For as large and well maintained an area, it was largely empty for a late Friday night dinner, but at about $50/person, the service is rather impeccable!~pasta, appetizers. mushrooms, ~4
7JCrB4ODzJmDaIk7l2L0rQ~-CyaOrqSG6-JPnccVh_r8A~Our hotel recommended this as a good restaurant to go to with kids. Wow. We were certainly surprised when we arrived with our kids to dirty looks from most. We asked how long the wait would be and the man said at least 45 minutes but no promises, it could be much longer. Since we didn't know where else to go in the city and had trekked all the way there with our three kids we said we would wait. I guess they realized they were not getting rid of us that easily and miraculously 5 minutes later there was a table for us.   The waiter was much nicer and accommodating to our family. He split a dish on to two plates for our kids and put tomato sauce on the side as requested by them. My steak was mediocre. For the size of the steak, about half of it was fat. I would have been more impressed with a small piece of quality steak rather than a gigantic one that you couldn't eat a lot of.   All in all, I would not recommend this to families unless you have teenagers that will quietly sit and eat dinner. Our small children are very used to eating out and traveling and were well behaved at this meal and we still very much felt out of place in this restaurant. We felt rushed to leave and unsatisfied after the meal. Disappointed in this Montreal dining experience.~tomato steak steak, steak ~2
-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA~vwg6RVz3BOO-Lbg8wRKjhA~Went to Afghan Village today. We wanted some take out food but once we saw the food table, we changed our minds. It looked like last overs from the previous day, so instead of take-out, we went to the side entrance to buy some freshly baked Afghan bread. We waited to be served, but the old guy behind the counter did not seem to ave any manners or customer service skills. I told him what I wanted and after awhile he grabbed a flat bread, folded it and gave us a horrendous racist look, like as though we were aliens. I guess he only likes to serve his 'Halal' customers. The bread was not the best and needless to say, we will never go back there again. If you want great Afghan breads, go to Afghan Supermarket on 549 Markham Road. They have the best baked breads and great customer service!~breads, breads ~1
-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA~ljtKfGk7yQ06Nk2vXhmQmA~I went to Afghan Village today at lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by my experience.  The menu is clearly displayed above the counter, although they have a few more dishes on their takeaway menu if nothing above stands out for you. I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.  The food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.  What I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.  The chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.  I also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.  It was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.  The service was solid, although unexceptional.  I went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common. However, I will definitely be returning, and perhaps after a few more visits, I'll be able to speak to their consistency.~kabob salad, chicken kabob chicken kabobs kabob kabobs kabob beef kabob chicken kabob wheat, white ~4
-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA~LcOoLJGXMWS4CtfAUzMf3w~The shawarma deal looked enticing - 2 for $6.99 but I'd definitely pass next time. They  weren't grilled and kind of soggy. You only have the option of chicken and even then, I didn't really enjoy it. The decor isn't anything to write home about.   The debit machine only works with their phone isn't in use - odd. So we had to wait until their phone was free to put our order in. I'll try it again though, since the skewer platters look pretty yummy! I love my Afghan food!~chicken ~2
-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA~PIybSbfJDMLaZQ6atB-dwQ~I was in the Eglinton and Don Mills area late last night and my friend and I wanted something simple and healthy, so we decided to try Afghan Village.    We both ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob dinner with rice, salad and naan bread ($9.99). The rice had raisin and shaved carrots in it and it was pretty good, not too dry or overly moist. The salad was somewhat disappointing, didn't seem fresh and really soggy. The main highlight was the chicken breast kabob which was outstanding, perfectly seasoned and flavoured, and very tender. The whole wheat naan bread was lightly toasted and pretty fresh for that time of night.  The only slightly negative part of the experience was the service, the cashier seemed slightly  confused taking basic orders and when she brought out things like the salad first, she only brought one and had to be reminded that there were two orders.~chicken kabob salad raisin salad chicken kabob wheat salad ~3
-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA~JMgboYCgyQ7t1kNVs8Ng1A~Two years after reading a review in the Toronto Star about Afghan Village Restaurant, I finally made it to Don Mills and Eglinton to give it a shot. It was awesome. Three of us went for dinner a couple days ago and we all left stuffed, satisfied and excited to return. The menu is predominately kabobs, meat, and I saw one lamb curry on the back page.   Two of us sampled the chicken kabob dish and the third person a chicken and beef kabob platter. The meat was succulent, spiced well and flavourful. The dish came with rice that had shaved carrots and raisins which was tasty , a side of salad and amazing nan.   I noticed people kept coming in the restaurant while we were waiting for our food and leaving with bags of nan to go. The nan at Afghan Village is not like Indian nan, it's whole wheat, a big long oval shape and doughy. Very tasty with our starter (can't remember the name). Although we couldn't breathe we were so stuffed, we had tea and sampled their baklava (a lighter, not overly sweet baklava). I would 100% return for dinner to Afghan village. While the decor is nothing to write home about, the wait staff were really friendly and explained dishes and took an interest that we were in the restaurant.   On a side note, the restaurant has a small "retail" store at the front by the door that carries food products, desserts, nuts and tea from Afghanistan.  Cool place.   http://www.thestar.com/article/307071~kabobs, lamb chicken kabob chicken beef kabob salad wheat, tea desserts, tea ~5
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~8VYfJUXGdTNzBL98V55CAg~This place has a great moody atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. I had Setu's Favorite which is a Pizza dish with pancetta, shaved garlic, baby clams, and roasted onions. It was delicious! I also had an order of Japanese Pretzel Sticks which come in a shot glass of chili oil. Great for $1.50. I also received a roll of smarties with the check.   However, the staff was the best part about this place. They were all extremely helpful and genuinely care about your experience there. I can see myself eating here often. This isn't your average pizza joint, it's definitely an innovative step in the right direction.~pizza pancetta, garlic, pizza ~5
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~Nkg6aYMtPCSihJ-K9uHQYg~Zen like pizza, never knew it would have clams on it! I came in to check out the joint after receiving my local magazine about my area. Initially I was drawn to the idea being a Buddhist myself but also the name just seemed cute. Upon entering, the owner told us he hadn't seen us in ages, which was funny to me since it was our first meeting.  The decor is a wide mix of Asian cultures, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, so you almost feel as though its going to be a fusion type of pizza you are going to get. You would be very wrong. For an appetizer we had the pb egg rolls. It was a nice concept and it tasted great. Only complaints is it didn't have enough spinach inside and it only came with three!  For the Pizza we ordered Setu's Favorite which is a Pizza dish with pancetta, shaved garlic, baby clams, and roasted onions. It was so good~ I didn't expect all the ingredients to blend as well as they did. A big plus to it too is it was crispy and there was zero grease stains in the pizza.  Come down and try this, maybe you can reach Nirvana.~pizza pizza egg spinach pizza pizza pancetta, garlic, pizza ~4
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~p8xMtX-xoZXX5hEmObEw-w~From the friendly Buddhist statements on the walls, to the 2 dollar draft beers, to the flash fried half chicken appetizer, to the magnificent crust on the pizza, this place ROCKS.  Hell, they even play rock and roll in the background, so it really rocks!  Outstanding service, fabulous food, unique atmosphere (and did I mention) 2 dollar beer!  I am working my way through the entire menu in multiple visits and  each time is better than the last.  This is truly a one-of -a kind pizza joint!  At the end of your meal they give you a little "wish book" to write a wish upon and you tear the page out and roll it up and stick it in a large sealed jar at the front.  I happened to glance over to see what my nine-year old son wrote for his wish.  It was "I wish for a Unicorn". My wish is to get back there in the near future (maybe even tonight) and have another astoundingly excellent meal.  GO Pizza Buddha!~chicken pizza pizza pizza ~5

0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~3P_SRHNUfgZSApmCuLF3iA~Tried Pizza Buddha yesterday, $2 draft beers were a nice starter, I went for the pizza but ended up getting the roasted and flash fried chicken instead, Outstanding, the flavors were enormous, I tried but did not use the creamy garlic dip that came with it, not needed, you simply cannot make this dish any tastier, the celery slaw that came with it also was excellent and a nice crunchy partner for the chicken. My wife loved her pizza as did I, the crust was perfect, delicious, and they only use the best cheese around to make their pizzas perfect, alot of care and thought at this place, she only had the pepperoni as she is a might picky, but the pizza still exceded our expectations, cant wait to go back and try the clam pizza, and the calamari...~pizza pizza fried chicken ~5
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~2_C02tqZCjM9LbcZvgS1UA~My fiancé and I drove by this new place and the smell was amazing, so we decided to give it a try for dinner. I don't usually eat pizza, but he considers himself a connoisseur.  We ordered the "papa Krakatoa" (their hawaiian style) to take home and we were able to have a glass of wine and a beer while we waited. The employees were very accomodating and our pizza was ready quickly. I was shocked when I tried the pizza- I haven't had something this delicious since I moved from back east. The quality of the ingredients and the seasoning were awesome. We definitely recommend this new spot and will be returning!~pizza pizza ~5
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~5sjiOm9zbJuJ5d68dL2kUQ~I've ordered pizza take out twice from this very hip place.  Both times I was quite impressed.  Every bite is full of flavor- you can quickly discern that they use the best quality ingredients.  Somehow they are able to get the toppings on the pizza so you get every topping with each bite, however they don't overload it so the pizza is weighted down with toppings.  The crust is thin and pretty good-I like mine crispy and crunchy and theirs could be a bit more crunchy for my taste.  I ordered a sausage and cheese pizza and their version of Hawaiian, both of which are excellent.  The Hawaiian has roasted pineapple, sliced red jalapeño(not too spicy), and their delicious crispy pancetta .  Their sausage is super tasty- they use some excellent quality sausage with fantastic flavor,  they crumble it perfectly so every bite has sausage but not too much.  Great pizza. I also ordered a pizza that has marinated cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts,  and basil.  Scrumptious and delicious.   These guys have a great formula.  Definitely a winner.  I would rate the pizzas I've had 9.4 out of 10.   I'm ready to go back.~pizza pizza pizza sausage cheese pizza pineapple, pancetta . sausage sausage sausage pizza pizza cherry artichoke ~5

Chef made the rounds at lunch checking on everyone.  The"Open Sesame" Chicken Salad is light, tasty, and the perfect lunch portion or shareable.  We shared and enjoyed the ho-tai pizza with delicious artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, spinach, garlic and olive oil.  Simply delicious!!

0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~rArcXxFwNPxLyJ_-MkOhRg~Good karma fills the air here at Pizza Buddha, it's the newest pizza place located in the Carnegie Center strip mall along Horizon Ridge. The focus is on a "zen relaxed" atmosphere, with brick oven pizza and nuances of Asian cuisine (mostly the sides) peppering the menu.   Atmosphere/Ambiance A - It's trendy casual. Interior is Asian themed with splashes of Asian art on the walls and ceiling. (Love the dragon painted beam) The dining area is small 5 tables of two on each side. You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, Easy Rock tunes (Brown Eyed Girl) was playing in the background.  No TV's though. Still it's a nice place for lunch or stop by after work and chill in the small bar area kind of joint.    Food B++ -  Now take into account I'm not a big fan of pizza lately. If you ever notice my pix at pizza places I dine at, I order everything but pizza most of the time...lol. But  for first visit sake I had some here.  All the pizzas are themed with Asian names, but toppings are just your average pizza toppings. I had the Ho-Tai(The Happy Buddha)  which was artichoke hearts, spinach, cherry tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. The crust was baked perfect, NY style, not super thin crust though. The ingredients fresh and good quality. The sauce was evenly distributed on pizza. It didn't overpower the cheese and veggies. I enjoyed the pizza.  It made me happy.      I also had the chicken salad. Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad. I will most likely come here just to have this salad for lunch next time.  Along with the Japanese pretzel sticks.  Those were different. Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip.    Prices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.    Service A+ - Friendly and efficient. For being open just a few days, service far out exceeded my expectations.  My server was knowledgeable about menu items and was able to answer my questions. The owner Mark also came by and followed up and chatted with me. He takes great pride and rightfully so with his new place.  Loves everything about Hawaii and the shave ice served here is inspired by Matsumoto's.  It's not quite like shave ice from the 808, but nice attempt with the Azuki (sweet red beans) and vanilla ice cream.  The other fun touches....The Wish Book! When you are presented with your check at the end, you get a Smartie candy and a little booklet where you get to write your wish and insert it in the wish keeper that's displayed in the middle of dining area. My wish didn't really come true this time around, a 49er win..ha! I had a nice dining experience though, that's what counts.~pizza pizza pizza brown pizza pizza pizza pizza artichoke spinach, cherry garlic olive pizza cheese pizza chicken salad. white chicken napa cabbage ~4

0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~70ryW4qxByP5XVeZGuWyMg~"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth." - Buddha  The truth about Pizza Buddha?  It's a new pizza joint that opened last month in Henderson and I love it!  It's not a very big place, but it packs a lot of punch, just like Pacquiao (except he got knocked out decisively after dinner, but I digress).  Before the Big Fight, my friend and I had dinner at PB and thoroughly enjoyed our first visit.  I say first because we'll definitely be back.  The name of the restaurant may lead one to believe that they serve some kind of weird Asian pizza combinations, but it's not like that, my friends.  There exists a Buddhist theme to the place, from the Asian decor to the names of the menu items, but the specialty pizzas are creative, not Asian, per se.  My date and I chose to create our own and settled on a large mushroom, pancetta, and shaved garlic pizza.  We ordered the PB Egg Rolls appetizer to start, which were 3 large egg rolls filled with ricotta and spinach.  Served steaming hot with a side of marinara sauce, they were tasty and I told our waiter he should have brought us 4 so we didn't have to split the 3rd one.  Our pizza arrived not too long after and we both agreed it was Buddha-licious, not greasy at all with a good-karma inducing crust and soul-soothing sauce.  I had two slices because I wanted to leave room for the dessert, shaved ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, and your choice of root beer, orange, or cherry flavor.  We chose the root beer and this would be my only gripe about the evening:  there was not enough root beer for all the shaved ice, as more than half of it was just ice with none of the root beer.  Don't order the dessert expecting Snow Ono-quality.  Our bill was served with Smarties candy and a Wish book for each of us to write down a wish and place it in the Wish Maker near the entrance.  Our waiter was fantastic, helpful in terms of the menu and attentive throughout the entire meal, genuinely positive and friendly.  My wish for you is that you get yourself to Pizza Buddha and enjoy the experience as we did.  Peace out.~pizza pizza pizza date mushroom, pancetta, garlic pizza egg egg spinach. pizza ice cream, cherry pizza ~4
0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A~pzTvPMpkZY0Urc7PvnGTng~Yay! Have a great new place in the neighborhood!   Went last night with friends for dinner, who tried it out earlier this week.   Great variety of appetizers that you wouldn't find in your typical pizza place, or  chinese restaurant. Nope, these were unique combinations of cheese, meat or vegetables that are an explosion of flavor.   We had the mozzarella squares & mushroom sliders for appetizers.  The mozzarella was topped with pesto sauce and tomatoes. Great flavor, however it was served warm to cold, not hot. Now to the mushroom sliders, one of the best appetizers I have ever had.. Portabello mushroom grilled and topped with pickled vegetables and an asian sweet sauce served on a soft bun. 2 per order.. They should do 3 or 4 with a side and serve it as an entree... So good..you want more..   We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids and a pepperoni & sausage for the adults.  Thin crust pizza with a tasty tomato sauce, cheese, sausage and I like the way they do the pepperoni, its in thin strips and not cut in circles. Both delicious  The combinations of the specialty pizzas sounded great, and I can't wait to try one on my next visit.   The staff is friendly, atmosphere is nice. Definitely recommend!~appetizers pizza cheese, mozzarella mushroom appetizers. mozzarella mushroom appetizers mushroom cheese pizza pepperoni & sausage pizza tomato cheese, sausage pepperoni, ~4

I call this a healing garden. I cultivate. Being able to resurrect heirloom vegetables is not only trending but it's being part of the greater interest in growing and eating locally grown foods that are revolutionizing our culinary scene. Many local restaurants are buying farmers market produce.   The real secret to growing is water and living earth. This should not be confused with hose water and dirt. Learning about modern growing techniques such as brewing tea, Alaskan compost, guano, microorganisms in the living soil and amendments will give you bigger and healthier yields.  Stop in for a class with Brian or Nick.~tea, ~5

Oh Boy has definitely raised the bar in the burger market for Toronto. The selection is great and the ambience is pretty cool. You can't go wrong with free refills on soft drinks either!  Awesome Juicy burgers and great crispy fries. I must admit that I recently tried the poutine and have to say that I was not all that impressed but aside from that, I am a huge fan of this place.~burger, burger burgers fries. ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~cipp44ApzKToAS06Bz4WpQ~An enjoyable experience!  I just wanted a burger.  And a beer.  And McDonalds doesn't serve both ;)  I immediately liked the decor and ambiance at Oh Burger, and as a party of two we seated ourselves at a little table to the left of the bar.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy but busy enough that most tables and a few bar stools were accounted for.   The waitress was very friendly, our order was taken and the drinks arrived quickly.  Our food was delivered by a very personable man whom we assumed was the manager.  I had the 8oz bison burger with mushrooms, a side of fries and Sapporo (a damn good Japanese beer!). I have to admit it wasn't the greatest burger that I've ever had, but what I really appreciated was that it was not dripping with grease and the toppings were fresh and delicious.  The. Fries. Were. Awesome.  For a quick bite, I'd go back any time.~burger. burger, burger mushrooms, fries burger fries. ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~4IVQffTdPyw3PcRSLzCSuA~The best way to test a place like this is to go during the weekday lunch hour.  Which is what I did.  There was about 12ppl waiting to order and 7ppl waiting for their food.  The grill guy seemed flustered and the guy adding toppings and condiments was loudly calling out people's names.  Overall it took almost 20min to get my food.    I ordered the classic w/ cheese combo w/ fries.  I found the burger to be a bit dry and chewy.  Definitely not juicy. The fries were soggy - they were definitely not fresh from the fryer.  The onion rings were just the way I like - battered not breaded and super crispy.  Overall it was just so-so.  Better than Craft Burger but not much better.  And its pricey too!  Would I go back?  Probably not.~cheese fries. burger fries onion rings burger ~2
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~swq8nXjShiZOfXpvLZVu0g~I finally had the good fortune to walk past Oh Boy yesterday and so I decided to grab some lunch. It had such a clean, welcoming atmosphere and everyone who worked there was superb.   I got the hot dog and fries... The fries are real potatoes (rare!) and even the hot dog tasted delish. The prices were reasonable and I was so excited to find out that they are open really late for those post bar cravings. I can't wait to go back and try the poutine! (I need to pace myself though post Christmas)  Definitely if you are in the area or craving something deliciously cheap, you should saunter on over to Oh boy Burger Market!~hot dog fries... fries potatoes ( hot dog burger ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~U9ILZxfT8gXcqJo95_XBCA~With such a disparity in the reviews here, I had to check things out. Meh. It was okay.   The atmosphere was great, and they had a good selection of beers available.  The food though was only so-so. Burgers:  We had the mini burgers, which were fresh and tasty with real cheddar cheese.  The side of garlic mayo was very delicious. The Poutine: Fries...not as hot as I would have liked, but the gravy was okay.  I doubt the curds were really curds, but more likely mozzarella chunks.  Which is okay too I guess.  Poutine, 2 mini burgs, 2 Mill Streets = 24 bucks.  I dunno....its a good place to go with friends to sit down and drink and eat, but Craft Burger just has more flavour, and would still be my first choice.~burgers: burgers, cheese. garlic fries... mozzarella burger ~3
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~E-N8KFVSnyJ-AFywHk4hkA~went with a friend a few days ago, definitely a lot more impressive than the first time around when I got takeout (obviously just worked out the kinks).  the back room is hella impressive (check the photo of the bar) and they have a jukebox machine that plays music videos throughout the bar (as a musicvideo junkie this is more than impressive). my roomate told me the owner got him and a bunch of friends drunk one night, I guess this happens a lot because we did free shots with our hot waitress (Monday at 7pm).   lotta beers on tap, this is definitely the kind of place to meet up weekend late night with some hungry friends and chow down/get hammered ($11 pitchers). apparently they're starting to do live music too.  I got the hogtown (two kindsa bacon), friend got the spicy one (jalapeños n bbq sauce). he liked his better than craft burger (my go to comparison), I didn't (but not by much). like some of yours, mine was a bit dry, and the craft bun is better. oh boy has more toppings/options and the fries/rings are better.  def going to do craft for takeout and this place for sit down eats, it's dangerous living between these places.~bacon) burger ( ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~lRvkdvyDLvVO6jqZDw6k1A~Oh Boy Burger is oh no closing down. I've been to this burger joint a few times and not going to lie, it's a solid choice.  They started off strong amongst the slowly crowding burger scene in Toronto and kinda died off. I'm not sure if it's simply the sheer number of new places always popping up or if quality has gone down since the doors first opened.  From the few times I've been, they have been pretty consistent.  I mean their burgers have never been the best as they would have liked to proclaim or the early reviewers would have suggested.  On this occasion I dropped by Oh Boy with Angela for lunch. I ended up ordering the cheese burger combo for just 9.95. I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries and onion rings with an iced tea. I topped it with the traditional toppings with ketchup and mayo. Angela got a Hawaiian burger with an iced tea.  She also opted for the traditional toppings with ketchup.  Now the burger is a solid burger. It's meaty and has a decent flavour to it. I like how it's not overly done so the moisture is still there. The amount of fries and onion rings were huge. I mean I love the portion sizes at oh boy. I come here knowing I'll be hitting a food coma when I'm done.  The sides weren't as strong as it has been in the past.  The crispiness wasn't there for the sweet potato fries and the onion rings were a little worse than their usual.  So definitely a little disappointing and I can see why there's a drop from their initial launch.  Angela liked her burger and like me, felt it was a solid all around burger.  I guess for the both of us it was disappointing to see oh boy go. The place was pretty much a pub which specialized in serving burgers.  They had the bar at the back with flat screens but I guess it just didn't work out in the end.  Overall, I liked oh boy. It's nothing out of the extraordinary, but sometimes all you want is a familiar taste at pretty reasonable prices. I'm a huge believer of leaving a restaurant full. Love that satisfying feeling and knowing that I got a good bang for my buck.  With it closing, I can only hope for another burger joint to take its place.  A place that will also provide a similar feel and bang for my buck. Thank you oh boy, I have always left needing to past out sooner than I think.~burger burger burger burgers cheese burger ~3
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~UNnOXCZ2PCkhvYQZkYy9ZQ~I spend most of my days in this neighbourhood and have never seen this restaurant - in fact I think it puts on an invisible blanket when I pass by everyday to and fro work - cuz like I said, I've NEVER seen or heard of it.  It was a  cold night though (my new venturing always seems to happen on cold days) and though I was weary about the fact that there was only a big man sitting in the booth looking outwards and nobody else in the restaurant - I went in for some good ol' pub food.  I had a milkshake and Chorico Burger with poutine as a side(can you believe that?!!), which came to about $15.  When the milkshake came, I thought , well that's about what it's worth - it turns out there was not enough of the shake, I found myself rationing it so it will last longer. It was GREAT....it wasn't orgasmic, but it was pretty close.  Then our waitress brought us our sides - in a bowl by itself - and I thought OMG if this is the size of "sides" I scared about size for meals -  the portions were ENORMOUS for a side - it was more of a meal. The food came, and it filled the whole table - I barely managed to finish my delicious burger (which I sort of forced to eat by the end, cuz I wasn't leaving none behind) and took my untouched poutine to go. I believe this is the only time I felt like I was paying too little for the food I was getting - the proportions were like Chinese restaurant proportions - you get $2 worth of food for $1.  I highly recommend it, particularly on those days when you and your crew are donkey broke, you can certainly visit this place and have enough delicious food for all of you  for less.~milkshake burger milkshake burger ( ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~KMqgrWUunhTs2H3hp7jA1A~Oh Boy! Let me start by saying that I mean this not in the way a child expresses delight at finding a much wanted toy under the Christmas tree, but more in fact the shock of seeing a train wreck unfold before your eyes...  Upon entering, one sign told us to go order at the counter which we attmpted only to be redirected to be served at the back of the restaurant. In the interest of speed, my dining companion and I chose the bar to look forwad to our first foray into what was surely to be one of Toronto's finest burger experiences.  We tried to order a couple of beer, only to be told by our self admittedly hung over waitress that they were "mostly out".  We were offered (for free to be fair), the dregs of a keg, and subsequently switched to one of the few beers they had left.  Recommendations were sought from our server - you know for an empty restaurant, she was sure a long time between visits.  I chose the highly recommended three cheese burger, while my companion chose a pure offering, one with fries, one with rings.  The burgers arrived (eventually) with no discussion about how they should be cooked at all...  My process cheese crusted to the top of a greasy, tateless, salt lick accompanied by freezer burnt greasy onion rings was difficult to stomach and required additional beer to get it down.  The natural burger was equally disappointing, and the french fries, soggy and over salted.  There's really not much point in pining on about the other shortcomings.  As we left with our stomachs wanting, our wallets emptier than they should have been, and considerably more time elapsed than reasonable, we couldn't help but wonder: On what day did God create Oh Boy Burger Market, and couldn't he have rested that day too?~burger cheese burger ~2
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~hezPwi4pZNLMtR9LRLH1nA~The burgers were decent, not amazing. What really turned me off was the horrible service.   My boyfriend and I were seated in a booth across from the bar on a Sunday night. The restaurant was fairly slow. The waitress said she would be right back to take our orders.   Well, she walked by 6 or 7 times over the next 15 minutes making eye contact but otherwise completely ignoring us. The bartender was chatting with another employee and didn't notice we had not been served.   Finally my boyfriend went up and placed our order at the take-out counter. The employee there apologized and said she would bring us our orders. The orders came but we had to flag her down again to ask for cutlery and napkins.   The food was nothing special, and being ignored (especially in a young restaurant that only opened 2-3 months ago) was not impressive. If they don't focus more on service for their eat in customers they might soon find they don't have any.  I don't recommend this place and will not be returning.~burgers ~1
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~413xzNf-D_oLWD9H5lIU-Q~We've been eying this place often since it opened, since we walk past it on our way home. Tonight we got around to checking it out, looking for a quick and tasty burger before tending to other tasks of our evening.  Arrived just after 7pm on a Friday night and it was mostly empty. A movie was being filmed across the street so we were happy to sit in the open storefront and watch the goings-on on Queen St and see snow arrive to try and turn a hot and muggy Sept evening into a winter scene (good luck folks). By 7:30 all we have is our drinks. Around 7:40 the onion rings arrive which are tasty and finished quickly. At 8pm we tell them we're out of time and are asked only to pay for the one beer we had. We leave, not having tried the burgers. Why does it take 45 minutes for an empty restaurant to make 2 burgers?  I guess we'll never know if the food is any good, but one thing's for sure - plan a long visit and go with low expectations on service.~burger onion rings burgers. burgers? ~1
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~ASfm5xIjiRXVZAzpCNmiqw~So, after a serious craving for RED MEAT, my boyfriend & i decided to try this new joint. Living on King St W has his benefits, and usually a burger craving would send us to Craft Burger, good 'ol faithful -- but tonight, we strayed. With great regret ...  It's 7pm.  Thursday evening. Even though we'd checked this site for reviews (which were scattered at best) we thought we'd give it a go. Mid week, later in the evening. Give it the benefit of the doubt.  The place was still busy.  But really, just full of a few people sitting-in to eat. We drove there, to check the place out, and place our take-out order in person - less chance of error ... riiiiiiiiight?!?   The 2 guys behind the counter were talking a lot of sh*it ... which we noticed right off when we walked in. They weren't young, but they were extremely 'young' acting, and immature.  We kinda knew what we were in for, but decided to continue in ..    The 'girl behind the cash' was a mid-aged-overly-made-up blonde girl, who looked lovely, but didn't have much rattling around in her head.  We placed our orderr: a little oh boy combo (there version of 2 sliders & 1 side (fries) & drink) and a Hog Town Combo (w/fries) and a single order of Onion Rings.    So, as we're waiting, we watch these 2 guys (I'll call them Griller #1 & Griller #2) huddled behind a very very small work space & exposed grill, that's publically displayed, so we can watch the exciting grilling action - kinda cool, right?  No, not really.  Because of the heat, it was just a fogged up mess.  But after witnessing what little we did, I highly doubt they'll want to advertise what goes on behind there!   My boyfriend then notices the box of burgers, on the floor. Just sittin' there.  We then watch, a guy come to pick up his order, and confirm his request of 'NO MAYONNAISE'. Griller #1 behind the counter, then looks at the burger in his hand, that he had just squired a load of mayo on. Noticing his mistake (and the guy who had requested it), he throws the burger to one side, and accepts a 'fresh' burger from Griller #2. And he re-makes his burger. This time with no mayo. Griller #2 must see potential for resale (!), so he starts scraping the mayo off .. and throws it back on the grill!!! AHHHHH!! Griller # 1 & Griller #2 were definite loud mouths - they were swearing, and making fun of how bad their service was - they were joking about drug use *including being under the influence* .. just the weirdest crap I'd ever heard spewing out ... and completely unprofessional.    We also witnessed them re-frying food. fries specifically.      Our food was 'ready' -  So. We never got the single order of onion rings. We didn't notice this until we got home, and inspected our dinner.  That, after we had watched the one Griller get in 'trouble' from the other Griller, for serving 'too many onion rings' in an order.  Makes one wonder ...  So, for $32.21 - failed & incomplete order  .75 cents - 20 minutes of parking,  Oh Boy! Did we get ripped off.   This all happened while we were there. I'm actually not even done my meal, but wanted to write this review while it was so fresh in my mind.

This was the best one I can remember.  I was treated well from the minute I walked in the door, which itself took some effort - use the middle door instead of trying and retrying the side ones in front of a crowd (like I did).  Had a good laugh and a warm welcome from two staff waiting on the inside before catching up with waiting friends Kat "the app for that" F. and the aforementioned burger baron.  I was greeted by the lovely and charming Vharay who advised on burger selection and beer offerings before provisioning a promptly pulled pint and a business card (as I had suggested that she didn't really have one).  I ordered the Oh Boy Classic with 3 Cheese combo, with a half-and-half fries and onion rings (it's not on the menu, although I think it should be, so don't count on this).  They have Mill Street Tankhouse on tap, and I indulged.    The burger came OEM with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and a good slice each of cheddar, swiss and havarti.  Aftermarket options exist, but the stock version sounded good enough already.  And it was.  8 ounces of AAA ground chuck, grilled to perfection and juicier than a Georgia peach in full season.  The guacamole had a creamy texture and flavour that added a high note to the gooey cheesy goodness, yet somehow through all that rich flavour the patty still managed to shine through and remind me why I was there in the first place.  I was in heaven for the three minutes that burger lasted in my hands.  The onion rings were fantastic - just a really well-made, classic ring.  Fries were thin-cut, which Is great for flavour, but they get cold fast (eat them first).  They were also perfectly salted.

1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~f-RoneakNVbZL5ai_2hRqA~everything that leads up to you embarking upon your eating experience seemed compelling.  oh boy - catchy enough name.  queen west - hip enough area.  even a few honest-ed style lights alerting me to it being "open" for business lure me inside with the hope of a juicy wheel of beef to call my own.  of course, the promise of a special on mill st. beer with my burger for a mere 16 bucks (right, mere...) clinched it for me.    well for a hefty price like that, it fell very short.  firstly, there was no mill street left.  no one has to go business school or ever work in a restaurant to know that if you dont have it available, DONT ADVERTISE IT.  i had to mention it to them to remove the sign, which they did.    the waitresses serving me were very nice, patient and understanding.  i settled for a sleemans, which was offered to me at a mere three bucks (here the "mere" is meant for real).  I sat and watched silent snippets of a women's hockey game in the olympics on one of the tvs that besieged you as you ate. (are we really that boring to each other?).  now i was in a rush and probably shouldnt have come there in the first place because i had a play to catch.  but i asked them to check on my burger - AAA 8 oz burger with havarti, cheddar, swiss, guacamole, tomato, lettuce - and they did and it came out a minute later - DRY AS A BONE.  i imagine that they are required to cook a burger to a certain doneness for legal reasons or some such, but when you have to load it up with mayo and heinz dijon (low quality for sure) just so you can stomach it, there is a problem.    i really cant express how tragic it is for me when i pay through the nose for food and it sucks.  they offered me a 15 percent discount card for the next time....i left it there.  im willing to acknowledge that a restaurant, a waitress, a cook can have a bad day, of course, but it is hard to return to a place which f-bombs it up the first time around on something you really could have done brilliantly much better at home, especially when they have the gumption to charge as much as they do - and if you tell me that the AAA prime ground chuck, etc., is the reason the price is up that high, then i say to you if i am supposed to afford that meat the respect it deserves (that already sounds weird, but okay), then you, as the cook better idolize it and make me faint with nirvana the moment after it hits my palate.~beef burger burger - burger swiss, tomato, lettuce - burger ~2
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~Knc-ttm2L-1NxUkXlYwmXg~Got there just as the kitchen was closing, but the waitress let us order anyway. My wife had the 1/4 lb burger and I had the classic 8 oz w/ 3 cheeses. Seriously, I couldn't tell the difference between the 4 oz and 8 oz. Either my burger lost half its weight in cooking or they gave me the wrong sized patty. It seemed a little bigger than a 4 oz, but not twice the size. There was a couple bits of gruel, it was a little dry and didn't have much flavor, even w/ the cheese. But the sodas had free refills which was nice since it was still warm and humid out. Seriously, how hard is it to make a good hamburger in this town?~burger cheeses. burger patty. cheese. hamburger ~2

1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~ONeYuDalkEoaFQfpHpSY5Q~I reside in Toronto, the splendid burger capital of Canada! Oh Boy burger, my burger... You get 3 stars...and a half if there was that option.  Things I like: - Nice looking venue, open until 4 am for drunken bur-gorging - Good sized burger, tasty, juicy - Guac and lots of it! Freshly made. - Free refills of soft drinks, cool glass coke mugs (I want one...) - Breakfast burger? They said it's coming in 2010... - Stout and ice cream :D  Meh: - poutine - not enough curds.. gravy not bad. - skinny fries (groan)  - slow service  I'll try the spicy burger and the onion rings next time.~burger burger, burger... burger, coke burger? ice cream : fries ( burger onion rings ~3
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~tRNSZKo4YWMhHJhV9hMPUg~So after sending my original review to Oh Boy!, Joey the proprietor of Oh Boy! emailed me and asked me to come by and he would buy me a burger and a beer.  Of course I brought Kat F. with me so she could ge the low-down on this place too.  Joey's a great guy and we learned some interesting things about him and Oh Boy!  1.  Before starting the Oh Boy! project Joey had hair (picture 80's hair band), but has a head now more resembling Mr. Clean 2.  Joey claims that he's "old, like really old", but doesn't look a day over 30. 3.  The Oh Boy! name stems from a diner in Toronto that no longer exists and is going to be a brand that says they're serious about what they do but still have fun doing it. 4.  It took a year to get Oh Boy! up and running due to the building almost falling over and new structural elements needing to be implemented. 5.  Joey picked the Queen Street location to be close to the entertainment district without needing to be in the middle of all the hype of the ED. 6.  Oh Boy! was started to give people a better experience to enjoy a burger.  Joey describes the experience as coming to the restaurant and enjoying premium quality ingredients while hanging out with friends, and grabbing a beer while the game plays in the background.  Upon this return to Oh Boy! I was even more impressed just due to the fact that they have Okanagan Springs on tap.  It was also great to see that they're working through the growing pains and things are coming together for them.  It was nice to see that our server Vharay was genuine in her involment to make sure we had a good experience and had everything we needed.~burger burger. ~5
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~e8UvZ6gnFbULavsX30hDFg~My opinion of Oh Boy comes from the vegetarian perspective and so, I can't actually say that the huge beef burgers I saw on the grill are better or worse than any other non-chain burger joint.  I got the Portobello burger, which is hopefully the healthiest 'burger' on the menu.  The topping options are all very similar to Hero Burger.  But, the sauces at Oh Boy are all free, including Guacamole!  I thought I had loaded it up with a variety of sauces and toppings, but when it came out it looked kind of puny due to Shrinkage of the 'bello.  The Chipotle BBQ sauce is not very spicy, but is very tasty. The Lettuce is no cheap ice-berg from a bag, it's good quality boston lettuce.  They have a few kinks to work out, but now is the time to go, because this place is going to get packed. On this First Sunday afternoon, there was hardly any room to sit. The front area is full of booths as is the back. In the middle there are a row of stools to sit on.  The back bar area is surrounded by TV's showing football and I can see this being a huge thing- bar, bar stools, booths and burgers.   I also tasted the poutine. The fries are on the small side, which is nice. But the gravy is very beefy and reminds me of the City Hall truck's gravy. This could be a good thing, but it's pretty low on my list of faves in the city.  The food is decent, the atmosphere is wicked and late night line ups are certain. Head there now, just don't get upset that they maybe ran out of half of the stuff on the menu....~beef burgers burger burger, burger' burger. lettuce lettuce. burgers. fries ~3
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~QOd4U5x-bRp6ddKJPKe9hg~I read a wicked review on this place, and decided to give it a try. I enjoyed it a lot!  I love the decor choices made with this place. Its a nice urban feel, with the kitchen front and centre, with nice booths and some corner tables for groups.   The burgers didn't disappoint. I had the "Hog Town" combo, which included the classic patty along with 2 types of bacon, onion rings, and a drink. I bought a pint of their local ale, which was a perfect compliment. All of it was amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.  My wife had the Oh Boy classic with 3 cheese combo, and she enjoyed it as well. I had a bite, and can attest to the quality. Everything was wonderful with hers too.  I thought for what we got, the price was very fair. The portions were generous. Both of our stomachs were satisfied.  What needs a bit of improvement is the service. Our server was pleasant but a little clueless. What was hilarious was how proud she was that she had remembered to write down the beers on tap, so she could read it back to us. I think she was new to the place, so I'm willing to give her a second chance.   Would recommend!~burgers patty bacon, onion rings, cheese ~4
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~rTPviSKSxPGHkJAIvJOXWw~Boy Oh Boy how you leave me wanting. I had high hopes for finally hitting the mother lode for burgers. (sigh) The previous reviews just went all over the place and I wasn't so sure what to expect but when my brother burger reviewer Chris P. sang the praises of the beef on a bun at Oh Boy I thought that they would be all that and a bag of chips.   I had appointments on Camden Street this morning so on my way out I thought I'd grab a burger from Oh Boy and take it for a dance. Trouble was that this burger couldn't even two step and basically had two left feet. I arrived at Oh Boy literally on the nose of noon hoping to beat the lunch rush and ordered up an Oh Little Boy Combo with sweet potato fries. Most of the major complaints I've read about OB's is that they seem to overcook the burgers so I figured if I ordered up the baby burgers and being smaller, they'd spend less time on the grill. Makes sense, right? Ummmmm....apparently not. It took almost 25 minutes before my order finally surfaced.   So out the door I dash with my lunch bag in hand only to discover ten minutes later that they eff'ed up my order. Wrong kind of cheese on those little sliders. No sweet potato fries but rather regular french fries which were soggy and cold by the time I got to them. As for those little 2 ounce burgers.... well they were pretty much small pieces of carbon on a bun. Did I order blackened burgers? They were dry and crusty and no amount of toppings was going to save these little charred nuggets.   Someone needs to smack those grill boys with a hot spatula because when you eff up Momma's burger she is gonna be pissed big time. For this shitty bag of baby burgers I forked out $13 bucks. I felt like I'd been hosed.   The restaurant itself is really cool. It's large and unlike Craft that can seat only about 8 people, the Oh Boy seats about 100 people. I love the bar area and I'm hopeful that eating in the restaurant would yield a much more favorable result. I've still got my discount coupons from the very first time I wandered in and the grill was out of commission. If anyone is interested in using them, let me know, I'm not so sure I'm ready to go back to Oh Boy just yet.   Afterwards I thought to myself that I should have walked a little further east and gone in to the Leslieville Cheese Store and gotten a grilled cheese for lunch. I would have been a whole lot happier.~burgers. burger beef chips. burger burger sweet potato ~2
1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw~FlJtdqHH_CfGGdyC1RP5tA~I came back here hoping to see improvements and let's just say I wasn't surprised walking into this establishment to see there were no customers. I guess the bottom line is that their burgers are no good.... they're not horrible, but they're not good either.  I ordered a Spicy Boy Combo and despite the burger being clearly cooked to a nice medium inside, it was very dry and black on the outside. Second, the meat lacked any distinctive beefy flavour and was very bland - it was almost like eating frozen patty. I think it's simply due to an inefficient kitchen that doesn't know proper food handling. They also need a better ordering system where burgers and fries are served within 10-15mins. Why should take 30-45 mins to be served? The owners need to make changes otherwise they'll be expecting to close down very soon.~burgers burger patty. burgers fries ~2
1Hhc1h5TETqtVMgasiimuQ~voBMNLlOgKKxkihPbYpqKA~An ok subway. Usually quick service. When I sit in the glassed area near the road I feel one typo while txting and ill have a car in my lap. The food tastes decent. Pulling out of the parking area can be horrible at times.The place had been clean each time. I also use Apple Pay on every visit with no issues.~apple ~3
1Hhc1h5TETqtVMgasiimuQ~Y80NH9Lu4bXALmCWgkL1pw~Contrary to Heather C.'s review of this Subway establishment, I found it to be quite exemplary. The decor was the now-standard Subway interior which consisted of well lit images of fresh produce and Jared. I had no qualms regarding the service either. The bistro was clean and even had a conservatory/greenhouse area that looked out upon the quiet main street, Main Street. If I should ever have the joy of returning to Sun Prairie and am in the need of a sandwich this establishment will be top of mind. Four Stars.~sandwich ~4
1Hhc1h5TETqtVMgasiimuQ~8LtORmtZKQhBcng62BwQVQ~Your experience at Subway is relative to its location and employees. While all Subway menus are the same, the quality and handling of food can change substantially from location to location.   This Subway has a group of employees that wish you would implode in the parking lot before you make it to their door. I'm not expecting someone to hold the door for me, welcome me to the establishment, and take my coat, but do you people really have to be such a bunch of frowny muthas?   I can't crack a joke, utter a friendly word, or either breathe in the same space as these employees without getting the look of death from any one of them, especially the older guy with grayish hair. He's either a card carrying member of the shortbus, or he's too busy fantasizing about stabbing me repeatedly in a dark alleyway to actually speak to and make eye contact. Maybe he's prone to seizures, I don't know.   If you go here, and you're even slightly undecided about what kind of bread you want, or what kind of toppings should go on your sandwich you should probably call the PoPo and ask for an escort back to your car.   I'm not one to hamper anyones freedom of choice, but enter at your risk, and bring an umbrella because they will piss on your parade.~sandwich ~1
4bOUHefNIMkOd5VqfpDgrQ~4GJ6Rxfyhc0U9aw9Jn2rAQ~Gotta love this place simply because of the price.  $6 anytime for a movie can't be beat.  We also get the popcorn bucket that you can refill for $3.50 every time you go back that year.  This place isn't the nicest or most updated place, but they seem to be remodeling it slowly.  The biggest drawback of this place, even though it's the closest theater to our house is that there are no restaurants nearby like if you went to the waterfront, or monroeville.  Yeah, there's Denny's and King's, but a lot of times we like to make a night of going to the movies, and that makes it tougher.~popcorn ~4
4bOUHefNIMkOd5VqfpDgrQ~y58EnwTZ-qYBQ9NGtZtJKw~I've been going to this theater since Destinta opened. I live nearby, so it's always been my default theater. The place has aged a little, but the stadium seating is still comfortable and the popcorn is good.  Since Phoenix has taken over, the best thing about it is that tickets are $6 all day, every day. Tuesday bargain days are $4, as are all tickets for kids and seniors. This theater does show new releases, so you can't beat these prices.  They've re-opened the bar upstairs, and I think there's food. I haven't tried it yet, but plan to soon.   My only problems are that when I was here a couple weeks ago, the A/C was blasting despite the fall weather, and it was freezing in the theater    Also, and this goes for just about all theaters, the sound is WAY TOO LOUD. To the point of bring uncomfortable. My 4 year old nephew is afraid to go to the movies because of this. I guess they think it adds to the experience or something, but it kind of ruins it sometimes.  Overall, I recommend this theater, but I'll be taking ear plugs with me from now on!~popcorn ~4
4bOUHefNIMkOd5VqfpDgrQ~d3R8f1rFLrdL-bytbceYVQ~This is the place that people who've been around for a while used to know as Destinta.  And like Destinta, it has many great things about it: Large screens, buttery popcorn, and a heck-of-a-lot cheaper ticket price than Carmike nearby! Also, be sure to bring in those student ID's cuz ya get a movie for $7.75... what a deal!  They even serve wine and liquor. Can you imagine: drinking a cold one while watching a Marvel superhero movie. Insane idea, but worth a try if you're over 21.  This is my classic kind of movie theater. They mostly show mainstream movies but on occasion have a indie or even foreign film, but don't count on this theater if those are your sole tastes.   Overall, great theater, good popcorn, great prices, and big screens. What's not to love? Definitely give this place your money over those sellouts at Carmike Cinemas.~popcorn, popcorn, ~5
7YBLX19t_P_CfPzM3JbolA~AG6B590yJp3hlETnji_zdA~Situated just across from the Collisium entrance inside Caesars you find this intimate little lounge.... We found it to be the perfect meeting place at the end of the day for a champagne cocktail or simple cup of coffee... Lovely, attentive servers take good care of you...the decor is tasteful and high end..and the centerpiece of the lounge is a fantastic aquarium that we stared at for hours... I liked also that children arent allowed..its a nice quiet environment for chatting or people watching...we'll be back again.... and again!~coffee... ~5
7YBLX19t_P_CfPzM3JbolA~0xgqWMv-MiQUMIPCrBBQ_g~5 stars for this casino bar because:  * I loved the champagne cocktails.  While on the pricey side (upwards of $15), this is sort of par for the course in Las Vegas...and they were so tasty!  They are all made with fresh pureed fruit, and come with a straw for extra sipping fun; I enjoyed the grapefruit-based one in particular.  Of course, they also have a full bar.  * Great ambiance.  The bar is located within Caesar's Palace, elevated a bit from the gaming floor and delineated by a half-wall that allows you to watch the gamblers and passerby.  The decor is defined by the giant cylindrical fish tank in the center of the bar, which lends a peaceful air to the place despite the business of the surrounds.  The chairs are large and comfy, and conversation is possible despite a medium level of background noise.    * Staff is attentive, courteous, and attired in funny little white dresses.  My husband and I hung out here for a very pleasant couple of hours, honing our blackjack skills.  I would definitely go back!~grapefruit- white ~5
2Y3uEhkTo728kRULUrsS-g~T4bjZVT8RpXUQTUjgcv4bw~Went here for breakfast.  The food is ok, but the service was terrible.  Granted, I don't speak much French, but I think that shouldn't completely change the attitude of the waiter.  Anyway, the entire time, we had to ask for refills of water and coffee.  Basic functions.  It wasn't even that packed. To top it off, the waiter took 20 minutes to get my check.  I asked several times and he told me to wait.  When I complained to the manager, he finally got my check, and claimed that I had only been waiting for 5 minutes.  The manager sided with him and basically called me a liar.   lol what?  Yeah, I'm not going here next time I visit.~coffee. ~1
2Y3uEhkTo728kRULUrsS-g~FGSUf9V9d5miq8WfubiUxQ~I almost feel bad for the waiters. The service was good, relatively speaking. I ordered the '16 layer lasagna' at 18.99$, apparently a signature dish. It was bland, the meat was rubbery, and the center of the lasagna was still cold. Definitely won't be coming back. Two stars for the waiters' effort~lasagna' lasagna ~2
2Y3uEhkTo728kRULUrsS-g~rX0SOVc--XhxQJnBToebEQ~The food is just meh. Not worth the price. Their chicken, pasta, soup and salad were not worth the gas money.  Service can be spotty from poor to average. I think they lost their good waiters in the past because of bad management.  I'm guessing the Bar side is what's keeping this business afloat. I think they changed their name or something. I didn't care enough to check the sign when I was leaving.~chicken, pasta, soup salad ~1
2Y3uEhkTo728kRULUrsS-g~6MmdvNxcEvjOP6IqaCt6mw~Dropped by for a coffee and BLT with a colleague from work.  Service was good, food was OK, typical east side Mario's food, decent value for what you get.~coffee ~2
5sedFEHtSRX84n6GxJ5-dA~VqXusUx-b0u-Cb_Gi2-JUg~The biggest ripoff ever!!!  How can you have a crawfish festival and not have any crawfish!!!  Arrived at 12:30 and the ONLY vendor selling crawfish ( aside from the Asian vendor selling pad thai with crawfish which I don't believe is "straight from the bayou") wasn't ready to serve!! WTH. I thought something was funny when we arrived and people were already leaving. But since I had already purchased my tickets on line ($72 for six tickets) I decided to give it a try. Once inside, there were hardly any vendors. Not to mention, the ones that were there didn't have much to do with Louisiana or the bayou.   There was one vendor there that was ready for food service but they were way OVERPRICED. $5 for a lemonade that tasted like it was made with sewer water, not sweet, and barely tasted like lemonade. Their food was sub par.   The music left something to be desired. The band was okay. Nothing like you get in NOLA.   No Bourbon street bartenders. No hurricanes. No beignets.   If there is a 2nd annual crawfish festival, you couldn't pay me to go. It was that bad!!!!~thai ~1
5sedFEHtSRX84n6GxJ5-dA~ZoKr8yyWOAPYZi3p3_nkfg~I agree with all of the above!!! Waited over one hour in line for crawfish boil only to be told they were out!! $14/person was OVERPRICED to say the least for what was offered.  This event needs to be re-thought before it happens again!  Sorry O missed the drunk women singers - that may have been entertaining!! At least the corn was good!! And the catfish - catfish was only a 20 minute wait but ram out early as well~corn ~1
5sedFEHtSRX84n6GxJ5-dA~ROvsS3tCWRJwal6QLEtF4A~What a complete waste of time, space, money and so much more!! I counted a total of 13 vendors only 4 of which had food. NONE which of had crawfish. There was an Asian place with some pad Thai with added crawfish but that is NOT why you go to a crawfish festival! The flyer advertised the obvious crawfish, as well as catfish, crab, shrimp, BBQ, cool NOLA themed drinks and I seen NONE OF THAT! We seen 2 snow cone trucks. One which had a few crock pots of some home made Cajun style food. (Weird) There was a dole pineapple vendor that was really cool. Fresh pineapples with frozen yogurt. Funnel cakes. And a hotlink/hotdog/BBQ stand. We got a hotlink that was decent but the onions and peppers were not at all cooked. The only people only serving a full menu were the Asians. Not a good look Cajun folks! We arrived around 11, we seem one big pot for a crawfish boil, that they said would start around 2pm!!! What the #%*#?! First off 1 big pot is enough for about 1/100 of the people there. And where's the rest?!?! I will be emailing and contacting everyone who had anything to do with this event. Never been so let down with a food festival. Get your stuff together. And for the record I've been to a Cajun food and music festival in Virginia. It included alligator, and beads, and awesome drum solos, and tons of hot sauce. NOTHING like this one!~thai shrimp, pineapple frozen yogurt. ~1
5sedFEHtSRX84n6GxJ5-dA~0rxuq3sal879hQX7KjZthw~The second I saw the advertisement for this event, and was going to be on my side of town, I rejoiced and told my family and friends to come along.  Had it not been for the company I was with, I would have been extremely disappointed.  Every experience is what you make it, and we made it fun, although yes they ran out of crawfish, yes the lines were to Louisiana, and yes there were only a few food vendors.  There was not a cap on pounds of crawfish you could buy.  The last 9lbs of crawfish were sold to one person.    My family arrived a later in the evening and two lines they hopped in ran out of food.  They did eat the catfish, which was so good.  I had roasted corn which was smothered in butter and I covered with parmesan and Cajun flavoring they had there.  Yummy! Later in the evening, one of the vendors had crawfish, which I tried.  The taste was not something I would jump up and down for, I've had better.  My friend and I tried the pineapple yogurt, which was refreshing.  I didn't know the difference when reading the sign of the breakdown of flavors, so I ordered the cheapest one, which was just pineapple frozen yogurt, with out the juice or fresh pineapple.    As far as experience goes, I was just chatting with people in line as we were waiting.  Music was going and my friend was dancing with my niece which was so cute.  Although the food was a bit of a bust, the crowd that I was around was just there for a good time and that's what they had.  This could have been a really good event, but this is their first one. If they decide to hold this next year, they should really look at the amount one person can purchase as well as other factors.~corn butter pineapple pineapple frozen yogurt, pineapple. ~2
5sedFEHtSRX84n6GxJ5-dA~eQ4PdwTKX11zr5jxEHSolA~As fans of the Lafayette, Louisiana area we were excited about this festival.  Well, that excitement lasted about a minute upon our entrance into the facility.  There were very few food vendors, the lines were horrific and the food didnt look particularly good.  The only food spot that had a short line was the one offering burgers and hot dogs - really!  This was a rip off and we should have asked for my money back as did a previous poster (he must have been the one getting a refund when we entered) but my wife wouldn't hear of it.  We decided to leave immediately and went to Lucilles for a Po' Boy which was about the same price as charged at the festival and a whole lot better.  At dinner we talked about returning for the music but since it didn't sound very Cajun, we just left the area $28 dollars poorer, but did get an education in picking festivals.  Will never return if they continue this event.~burgers hot dogs - ~1
0Qbg9jgsFhmUbrI-03tlSQ~oY6FhWECYP7W3ctf5lIPtw~I've now been to Angel Hairdressing two times, and both of those I was pleased as punch by the results! For one, it's absurdly close to my flat, which makes visits and appointments a breeze. Secondly of course would be the lovely staff. I've been served by the same hairdresser both my trips, and she remembered me the second go round, which makes for a pleasant welcome. Size-wise, It's a small joint, but more than enough room for the ladies to perform their miracles, and it feels reasonably homey inside.  What seals the deal for me is the prices are totally reasonable--I've seen some places that make my eyes practically roll back in my head around town, and I've never been one to willingly shell out a week's paycheck for my hair. But Angel has fair prices to match the excellent service. My first go featured a simple cut, the second, a full coloring, and I'd give five stars to each venture. This is definitely my go-to salon!  Extra perk: I was offered a cup of coffee or tea while waiting for my color to set. Don't mind if I do!~coffee tea ~5
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~MdCJTtdlCAmDuR1262Mt5g~Cute spot with outdoor seating on the upper wrap around balcony.  Grilled octopus and french fries with white wine made for a great lunch and pretty reasonably priced. Service was quite friendly and there was no problem doing separate checks for a large group (a really nice options found in most Montreal restaurants with the portable card readers...NYC needs to get on that stat!)~french fries ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~c6svL_i-dCmGC2C4bVm3vA~We had breakfast here, and it may have just been an off day, but it was a little disappointing. The food was good, but our toast arrived 3/4 of the way through the meal after 3 reminders, and coffee refills were slow. The waiter was very nice but a little scattered and said someone didn't show up for work. It was pretty quiet in the late morning, but walking past later in the day, it seemed to be much busier.~coffee ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~Jyw_BgY2e73ytRZiSyPNCA~Come here for the second floor balcony. It's refreshing to be able to sit and people watch while enjoying a good drink. There's also something satisfying from being on a second floor balcony as opposed to it's first floor counterpart.  We started off by having the bruschetta. Their bruschetta is piled high on each piece of bread they give you. You can really taste the fresh ingredients, but for some reason it all seems to fail to come together in the end. There is something missing. This ended up being a theme of our meals there. My girlfriend had a pizza with pesto and grilled chicken pieces. The chicken could have been spread out a little more throughout the pizza, but this could be the way they do it in Italy so I can't judge. This dish also seem to struggle to bring everything together.bThe dish I had was a creamy pasta with goat cheese and walnuts. I actually really enjoyed this dish but somehow think it needed just a little more kick.  Being on the tourist trap of a street that is crescent, I wasn't expecting cheap prices. Many of their dishes are more on the expensive side but considering some of the ingredients and the nice location it is pretty justifiable.  Our waitress smiled and was very nice and didn't bother us too much which I liked. We could have received more water even though we had order drinks though. Other than this very good service.  In the end I prob wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I was with friends and wanted to relax with a drink I would definetly hit this place up.~pizza chicken chicken pizza pasta cheese ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~-OKXRaE-tFpxs9w9s52IQQ~sorry all, this is not a 5 star establishment. it's more like a 2 star since to me au pied de cuchon and ferreira cafe are 4 stars. we went here tonight after seeing the previous yelp reviews. to be honest, we had rsvps at auberge st. germain but cancelled since we wanted italian and a break from the french cuisine. i kind of regret this decision now but it is what it is. service was ok, restaurant is casual, huge portions and price decent. it seems to be in a happening area with bars, clubs, and other restaraurants although we did not walk on the street afterwards. about a 10 min cab ride and 25 min walk from the w montreal. we ordered two green salads (waiter did not tell us that 4 people could have easily  split the salad to be honest - it was THAT big), the penne arrabiata and the pizza italiano. the penne arrabiata was quite spicy. the pizza was good, not amazing. hit the spot b/c we were wanting something italian. thin crust with crunchy crust. overall, i expected the quality to be average and it met expectations.  would i come back?  probably not...i was skeptical to see 5 stars so did not set my expectations very high so i was not disappointed. next time, we probably will check out other italian establishments. we spent about $70 for both of us, included pellegrino and a beer. would have rather spent this money elsewhere but you live and learn. restaurant looks more upscale than it really is with the mod white dining chairs. dress/atmosphere is very casual.~salads ( salad pizza pizza white ~2
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~sUl91rtWDpCN0rETpAfj6w~My husband and I stopped in for a late dinner Saturday night around 9:00pm.  We were given a table immediately, but the waiter was so surly and miserable that his attitude really ruined our evening.  Although we were clearly speaking English, he spoke to us in French - when he even spoke at all... Mostly he just grunted at us or ignored us.  The food was mediocre at best, the "rolls" were more like hot dog buns, the caprese salad boasted unripe tomatoes, no balsamic vinegar and some sort of pre-packaged pesto sauce that looked like baby diarrhea... The salmon was bland and smothered in cold sun-dried tomatoes that were presumably some sort of sauce. I had the filet mignon, which was edible but could have been cooked in a microwave for all the (lack of!!) flavor.  Definitely would NOT recommend this place to anyone.~hot dog salad salmon ~1
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~U6pueAjFID59BtxLeEzqdA~The food was ok. Our calamari was a tad overcooked and the gnocchi a little dense. The shrimp and asparagus risotto was very tasty as was the Italian pizza. 2 beer each and our bill was around $95. I don't think we would go back as it wasn't that memorable.~gnocchi shrimp asparagus risotto pizza ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~1X6nmMSVEHQ1mbEUCuRrKw~Disclaimer: I came to Pino on a Friday, which was the coldest day of the year with about 25 people, therefore my appreciation might have been altered.  What I liked: Restaurant is pretty roomy. The resto has an upper floor for bigger parties. The view gives on to Crescent and de Maisoneuve. The portions were reasonable. The price was too. I had the chicken al palio which was decent. I suggest ordering pasta, because theres a large selection and it comes with a decent amount of protein or vegetables. The crowd seems reletively young (early and late 20s), especially when I was there. The drinks are averagely sized, I didnt check the price though.   What I didn't like: My friend who was the birthday girl had made a reservation for the correct amount of people, but when she arrived places were missing. We were stuck reorganizing the seating our selves. I feel they really work hard to give a true italian feel by allowing a 45 minute delay between serving everyone else and then serving me. The music wasn't appropriate at all, a mix of rap with some asian sounding stuff. Given that it was the coldest day of the year, most of us froze upstairs waiting to get our plates and then waiting to pay.   Conclusion: not my favorite resto. I wouldnt call it "authentic" food, although the disorganized managament seems authentically italian. You'll probably not see me back here. The only thing that could bring me back is the location. But not the food.~chicken pasta, ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~qkjwNZjreKIKFaYr0PjA9Q~Pino is a decent place to relax for a drink but it seems to be struggling with an identity crisis of "am I a pub? am I a restaurant? am I a lounge?" - and it was indeed a bit odd that such a huge venue was relatively empty on a rainy Friday night. especially since the rain didn't seem to be stopping the crowds on Crescent Street from going to other places.  they have an outdoor seating area upstairs with a long canopy over it - this was great, because we got the cool fresh air and none of the rain. and it's actually fairly spacious, wrapping around the entire place (it's on the corner).   I ordered some of the house white wine. it was about average, though it also was fairly cheap, so I'm not complaining too much. service was pretty fast too.  the fact that it is so roomy here might have made it seem less busy than it was. there were plenty of patrons up near us, but there were two HUGE rooms inside (on the second floor alone) that were empty. what gives? maybe they focus more on large-scale events.  seems like an alright place to relax for a drink or two, but not much more. I like low-key, but it was a bit too low-key for me.~white ~2
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~L5XHbLeaWc_yVoqqa_gjdg~When its hot outside and you want to people-watch, come here and sit at the terrace on the 3rd floor.  Great views.    $8 vodka sodas.  Pizza w/chicken was meh.~pizza ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~PorJiqyhmlwK-V4N3x2sdg~Wow. Just awful.   Easily the worst meal during a weekend in Montreal, where the food is, on average, really great.   Onion soup was incredibly bland. Watery and tasteless. Three people in my party got it and none of us finished even a quarter of it.   For the entree, I ordered a pizza. Oh man. All of the ingredients came straight from a can and were clumped in weird bunches across the surface of the pie. The olives were barely drained and the crust was overly doughy.  The waitress seemed to mean well but she didn't seem to understand how bad the food was there. And so she seemed annoyed at our lack of enthusiasm for the place. The management is responsible for the poor quality of this place, not the poor waitress who served us.   The only thing it has going it is the location as it is in the middle of a popular part of town.  We should have learned our lesson as soon as we walked in as it wasn't very crowded.~onion soup pizza pie. ~1
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~dNfpaGETXogJKLvyCSPxlw~Had the salmon fettuccine and quite enjoyed it. The cream sauce was delicious and the fish is something I've never tried before in pasta. The window seating above the street makes for entertaining people watching as well. Service was prompt and the restaurant kitchen is open later than most of that stretch.~salmon pasta. ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~XmLLntMWIZgWKvDcWTyK4A~This place is probably one of the best restaurants in Montreal! It's been around for years in a prime location. The decor is beautiful and modern, and the terrace has a great view of the entire city. Lots of tourists in the summer. Their eggs Benedict are the best I've ever eaten, (surprising since it's an Italian restaurant), and their pastas and soups always hit the spot. Delivery is always a short waiting time as well. Great food, open late, good-looking staff - what more could you ask for?~eggs benedict ~5
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~GiiKq2-JELZsg9GDa_WMIg~Absolutely incredible!  The Gnocchi al Gorgonzola is to die for. My Caesar salad was also great.  Our waiter was super friendly and was cracking jokes with us the whole time. Nice relaxed atmosphere, great eats, and fairly priced drinks. Got a table really quickly, and the service was fast and efficient. Two big thumbs up for this place :)~gnocchi salad ~5
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~DlbKXIPWRbZHHV1UZ6ieog~I came here with a group of 7, we were just trying to find an average price restaurant, with good variety of food that everyone will have something they can eat. I'm not expecting a lot when it's a situation like this, but this restaurant was not able to live up to my already lowered expectation.   Food: The server brought us two baskets of complimentary bread with a dish of olive oil and vinegar . The bread looks decent, they look like some homemade croissants. But, the texture was awful!  None of us can take a second bite of it, it's so dry! It taste like it's either a few days old or it has been microwaved multiple times! Also, the olive oil to share? what is this? Are they expecting everyone to dip in that plate? It's so gross....and inconvenient. Its okay to share butter or other spread, but I've never shared olive oil before. We ordered an Italian sausage pizza as appetizers to share, it was average, the crust was too thick...nothing special. Main course, I ordered a veggie primervera, which is just vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce.  It did not satisfy me either, overall very blend and in terms of vegetables, I was expecting some portebello mushroom, big slice of eggplants and cucumber, cherry tomato.... but instead, it's all thinly sliced, you almost can't see them in your pasta, and just regular mushroom that were shrunk after cooking. The tomato sauce was also too glue-y..... Dessert - I shared a Tiramisu with a friend, it's the type that comes in a cup with lady fingers at the bottom of the cup. This was like one of the worst tiramisu you can get at a restaurant. It tastes like store bought, and made one week ago. The cheese on the top are already becoming chewy and jello like! We only had half  The food are so terrible, when the server came and ask how were the  food, I actually said it tastes bad (because he saw our unfinished tiramisu) and I think he was offended.  Service: He forgot to bring the spoon for people who ordered pasta. SO this is what happened, I asked for a spoon as soon as he puts down my plate of pasta, and it took him like 5mins to come back because he went off and took care of other tables and he forgot... when he came back, he only brought 1 spoon for me, not for my other friends who were also having pasta. (well, you'd expect him to bring enough for everyone who's having pasta, that's a standard utensils to eat pasta , especially it's an Italian restaurant, how do you not know that) ...Later, my friends that are sitting at the other end of the table had to ask him again for spoon...   Ambiance: nice patio of second floor....maybe you can come here for drinks, but just don't eat here~olive olive butter olive sausage pizza appetizers pasta tomato mushroom, cucumber, cherry tomato.... pasta, mushroom tomato cheese pasta. pasta, pasta. pasta, pasta , ~1
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~LTr-z38wka68X1IVq-a2uQ~We stopped here while visiting Montreal for the U-20 World Cup. We just return from watching my beloved Portugal lose to Gambia 2-1. I was not in the best of moods when we entered Pino's but once we sat down and started to eat and drink all my sorrows were gone. We sat upstairs on the balcony and had some pretty good pasta and it taste even better with the Stella Artois. I love coming to Montreal because one thing is always certain, the food is always top notch. Pino's is one of my favorite places to dine in Montreal.~pasta ~4
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~Tm-jxlWzaREn0nFhB9iS_A~Let me preface this, by saying I haven't been here in over a year, but! for the last 4-5 years when I have been coming to Montreal for work/play, this has always been my favourite restaurant/lounge and never fails.   Their menu is standard, but changes everytime I come. Agree with Lauren W. about the Gnocchi. This was the first time I tried it and I love it! Everything here is very good, except once I got the Gorganzola + Endive salad and I wasn't pleased - but not the fault of the restaurant, I think Endive is an acquired taste.   The food is mainly Italian. It's on the busy street of Crescent, and one of the less touristy spots. They have 2 levels, a more loungey one at the bottom, and more restaurant on the top. They also have a nice balcony out there, and perfect for people watching. Same for the downstairs as it's walled with large glass windows.   It brings back a lot of memories for me because I have been here so much, and always bring people here.~gnocchi. endive salad endive ~5
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~FVcrnXRjtkJPjeV8qU1gig~Another staple of my restaurants to visit when in Montreal. Prices are what you would expect from a nicer looking spot in the area. The carpaccio was delicious. The spicy shrimp pasta was a disappointment as it was not spicy, the basil was soaked into the dish voiding the flavour and fragrance basil is supposed to give. The other pasta dish ordered was a deliciousness creamy mushroom sauce over penne which was superb. For $100 dinner I would have expected a bit more.~shrimp pasta pasta mushroom ~3
83Vim9NHp66yLPPVlCl5Iw~D15Ew5_qMkAXAORBSXyeXQ~I wanted to love Pino--a lounge with an extensive cocktail menu, a canopy-covered balcony, etc.--but it was just OK, in my opinion.  Maybe it was the overly strong smell of Parmesan cheese from the next table, the lackadaisical service or the fact that the place was pretty dead on a night when the other Crescent Street bars were hoppin'.   I would give Pino a lower score but that lychee-tini was exactly what I needed. I wouldn't make a point of coming back to Pino but I did enjoy sitting on the balcony, taking in the cool breeze on the rainy night.~cheese lychee- ~3
45IHzSJj49HJn32G3j6H_A~ojO2uy_RWtM_1XfaAH0fUw~I was telling a friend about my singular experience with Wienerschnitzel, and she reported similar feelings, so I thought I should warn others about my experience.   I ate at this location once when I was in high school, before I became very health-conscious, and it was a very memorable experience because it was so unpleasant.  I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the hot dogs with onion and peppers on it, which I remember were overly greasy, soggy and limp.  It looked like gelatinous mush.  There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.  I don't know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didn't taste natural or right.  It tasted unnatural and wrong, like is was tainted in some way.  For some reason -- I guess i was hungry and didn't want to waste my money -- I ate the whole hotdog.  I remember feeling queasy afterwards, like my stomach had been insulted and abused.  That was the day I made a personal vow never to eat at Wienerschnitzel again, and I am reaffirming that vow today.~hot dogs onion ~1
45IHzSJj49HJn32G3j6H_A~ItWE4BD6xDSyGKp0ODrLeQ~this is the only stand-alone hot dog place in the neighborhood & it is usually really good.  this time it was late & everything was old & bad  even for $6 it was not a good deal  you would be better off going to 7-11 and taking your chances at any old gas station~hot dog ~1

It came with a large tray of sumptuous  salad. The food was great with loads of extras on the side --- their white and hot sauce is a great condiment to enjoy with the meals!  We finished up with hot Turkish coffee and baklava!  Special mention for the owners --- they are very hospitable!~salad. white coffee ~4

6M7yFM_C9pDovCDk51lO_w~KE510L_qmMIn0CunEHYk2g~Great location and great selection of cake decorating stuff.  I was having problems sourcing dowels for a cake so thought I would Pop in whilst I  was in the area.  The customer service was pants! I had a good look and could pretty much see everything but dowels.  I asked the woman behind the counter if they had any or was it a case I couldn't see for looking and she very snappily said they will be over there if we have any and flipped her hand in the direction of the dowels, I really should have left then But I REALLY needed those dowlels as my delivery hadn't arrived in time.  I had a look and she came over and pointed and said in a very brusque manner well they should be there! I really felt like it was my fault thee were no dowels.  Because of my order not arriving I did need to pick some stuff up but only did so as I was in a fix otherwise I would have left.  I asked for 21's on a stick as they seemed to be every number there but 21 and she snapped again.. We don't have any! Seriously love, it's not my fault but yet you make me feel like it is!  As we were paying, another lady came out and she was much more friendly, which is why I gave an extra star.  She explained that the dowels had been ordered but as one thing was out of stock on the order the whole order had been put on hold... There see that wasn't too hard, a friendly member of staff with an explanation... That's all the situation needed, unfortunately she was too late to make my experience a good one because of the awful attitude of her colleague.  I won't be recommending this shop to people which is a shame as they have a good stock of stuff.~cake cake ~2
0E8fayAcoRFXgW2nPurPMQ~X0SQVjQsrT2MkEXv1LrNEg~I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs.  I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like " missing manual or dead battery" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on.  I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band.  I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no.  I get "as is" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date. Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price.  Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.  Pissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad~date. ~1
59okD6I_2Sy925jXKljgCg~VOJUBnj--dDlw_kuhgHFtg~Hello and goodbye!!!   I was disappointed with the "quality" of fish here. Actually, it was probably the least fresh tasting sushi I've had in years. (And I've eaten a lot of mediocre sushi!)   I'm not giving Hello Sushi only one star because the owner/sushi chef/server was nice enough and it could have just been a bad day when I was there. Nonetheless, I can't imagine a reason I would ever return.~sushi sushi! sushi ~2
59okD6I_2Sy925jXKljgCg~i7tRrBViSt8t8b6VFwwGxw~This place was my favourite place to go for sushi. The prices were unbeatable, and the quality was astounding. Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that this place has closed down. NoOoOo! :(~sushi. ~5
59okD6I_2Sy925jXKljgCg~PUI6cC-4dgQZ8u5xz3MVKg~Great little place with excellent prices!  Chef was our waiter (slow night) & was very helpful. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that they don't serve alcohol & it would be nice to have a sake with our meal.  We both got the semi lunch (a mixed roll/sushi plate & veggie plate) for $7 each! All were fresh & tasted great. Miso soup was good & tea was a nice extra. $19 including tax for both our meals & I had leftovers!  We will be back for sure!~miso soup tea ~4
3G0xkrBv2FY_Vel0K5iYVQ~bC0Vz6NMXeLLb9jy2hDH7w~I'm liking this new Bulk Barn!   Bulk Barn is dangerous for me. Too many delicious things that I just have to eat. Sweets, chocolates, cookies, chocolate covered nuts, trail mixes.... I love their sunflower seed butter and sometimes dream about their "clowning around" trail mix and the bins of chocolate chips. They also have healthier things like quinoa, oatmeal, spices, teas, coffee beans etc and non-bulk items like nut milks, British chocolates and pretty much everything you could need for baking.   I prefer this store to Carlton St. The layout is a little nicer and the bins are smaller with a place for the spoon. Check-out was slow because it has just opened and the assistant was being trained in. Having been there for the first week of Carlton St though, I'm pretty confident that they'll all by up to speed within no time. Great location too, close to St Lawrence Market and No Frills. Just don't forget the lovely Domino Foods downstairs in SLM. They deserve some business too!~cookies, butter chips. quinoa, coffee ~4
3G0xkrBv2FY_Vel0K5iYVQ~ZM8AWs-jyKTjTrxzu4jYRQ~I'm a fan of bulk barns in general.  They have a wide variety and grains. This stop in, I was looking for crystallized ginger ~ yes, I'm totally planning to back some chocolate ginger cookies.  Yum.  In all seriousness...I have no idea where else to by crystallized ginger!  They also have a wide variety of sweets, which I'm also thankful for.  The staff was super helpful here.  They helped me to find what I need, and they even bagged it for me.     The checkout experience was also good.  The staff here know their stuff. Stop in, it's fun.~ginger ginger cookies. ginger! ~4
3G0xkrBv2FY_Vel0K5iYVQ~BH4QApvMkPl42Ag0b4Us-A~This new store has opened up at the location that housed the now defunct Rogers Video. The location is decent as there is a dearth of this kind of store in the area. There were quite a few people shopping here when I visited so I am hoping this store will do well and serve this area long term.  The location is somewhat medium sized for this chain of stores. Prices can be reasonable when things are on sale or if you want a smaller amount for certain item this place at least gives you an option to try before shelling out $$ for whole box load. Good selection of all sort of items such as candies, flours, chips, dry fruit etc. etc.  The place is well lit and only downside is the limited number of cash registers which lead to lineups on my visit here.  3.5 Stars all said and done.~chips, ~4
3G0xkrBv2FY_Vel0K5iYVQ~6n6bRBSyutiDrVtPqRNZ2g~This Bulk Barn is awesome! Lots of things to eat from Candies, nuts, chocolates and  much more! The reason why i love it so much is because of the new location! It's very convenient for George Brown Students! They can get their groceries done in minutes after school or before school or maybe grab a snack for class since it's sooooooo cheap! I always come here and gets lots of things!~brown ~5
2Y3aq6MW6xlrcCa2CAE_Zg~VvlDvEL3dSFCllWMBehOXg~I miss the old original Warshaw's on St.Laurent.  I remember going in there and practically decorating everything in my first apartment from the old store. They had it all. Great location, great furniture, great big gold-framed Rococo mirrors, giant plants, floral papasan chairs at a fraction of what you  would pay at Pier 1.Then you had all the knick knacks and odds-and ends to look at.  Now it's re-located to the Atwater market area, firmly ensconced among the gentrified factories-turned-condos along the Lachine canal. Now it's on one floor instead of two (Ok, 1 and 1/2 if you include the ramp in the back). Now the plants are majorly overpriced and so are the kitchen goods and gadgets, probably in line with keeping up with their new yuppie clientele. Now the people who work the cash are pretty rude and abrupt when long ago they were friendly enough to even deliver bigger purchases. You know a situation is bad when you've just bought a whole slew of plant potters and you need to ask for a bag and get a scowl in return.  While it's true their kitchen selection has some neat, one-of-a-kind stuff, it's not fun coming here anymore. It feels more like a chore.  If you're looking for good, healthy but affordable plants, go to Zellers at Alexis Nihon. Come here for your fridge magnets, salad bowls and coffee mugs.~salad coffee ~2

She has been a Hairstylist for 16 yrs. and keeps up on the latest styles and techniques.  I have dark brown hair with some gray roots and she was dedicated to making sure the proper color type and mix was used to make the coverage look as natural as possible.   I highly recommend her salon.~brown ~5
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~ncuPTxh8z-0udFZXciE2ww~I don't hate hipsters so maybe I am not operating with a filter set to Do Not Like.   I thought the bar/tenders/decor was great. Not HOLYSHITAMAZE! but I went out to have fun, I had fun. Success.   I also had been out at another bar previously and had a couple delightful drinks so maybe I was already feeling misty watercoloured feelings? Perhaps.   We had the absinthe drinks - now that's a wallet ding for sure but I had never tried it before and so, whatever IMO - and they were tasty. I had another cocktail but the name evades me since this is a couple weeks back. I do remember digging it though.   We shared a dozen oysters - I am low level addicted to oysters, but on a beer budget so have to abstain except a couple times a year. They were so delicious. Like eye rolled into the back of the head good. God bless the ocean.   I'd recommend it as a date place or when that super generous boss foots the bill - not on the regular unless you are Scrooge McDuck. (And if you are, get in touch)   High fives.~date ~4
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~hUXsGboQOP7jcLledQ-6VA~I went here with my husband and relatives a little while ago listening to a friends recommendation. Absolutely fantastic! The food was amazing and fun, the menu is small (which is a good thing) so you can really tell that they put care into their dishes to make sure that every single one is excellent. Our server was lovely, sweet and very helpful when it came to explaining and recommending cocktails and food items for us. #1 fave? The pork belly, oh man, like butter in your mouth!~pork butter ~5
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~QjLEaAN8MOsZPbxJQ9DalQ~Ok, revelation this was the location for my 50th family birthday dinner. Yes admittedly I was probably one of the oldest in the room.  Synopsis: service excellent, food outstanding, cocktails amazing.  We dined a scaramouche last week and most of us hated (and I don't use that word often) the cocktails. Here we found each one unique, beautifully presented and most important tasty.  The oysters were all delicious and fresh even though I don't understand serving a hot sauce with something so flavourful.  Duck confit- score. I think there was deep fried apple in there.  Steak - beautiful cut and perfectly cooked but I have to admit I dont like my steak covered in sauce but I think that was my mistake. The fennel salad had too much of a similar creamy texture. Fried oysters were lost. Daughter had trout and which was excellent and beautifully paired with watermelon radish.  Perfect white ganache to sip on.  Would highly recommend this restaurant.~apple steak - steak fennel salad radish. white ~4
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~z8rpqYHyREPgLEuIIvm3nQ~Great cocktails, fantastic ambiance, fun staff. The first time I went I would have given a 5 star because the food was actually heaven. The second go... the food was bland, boring and uninspired. The plates were also quite small. Was a disappointment. Great date spot if you would just like some drinks though.~date ~3
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~x2K5w608B8rc5j_IUAySYw~Not many reviews of this small restaurant, which surprises me. Wasn't sure what to expect.  Liked: drinks were good; bathroom was very nice; duck confit croquettes very good; oysters fresh and yum.  Disliked: they never brought my last drink so we had to cancel the order and leave (restaurants: why won't you bring me alcohol!! So frustrating); pork belly was good but the accoutrements didn't really make sense; fries good but dip boring; horseradish for oysters totally no heat; wouldn't let us sit at a 4 top that never got sat--when they realized this (if it really was being held prior) we should have been offered to move; sliding door/wall wide open and I was freezing.  Too expensive for the area. Better stick to downtown.~croquettes pork fries horseradish ~3
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~ndkpRC0NZ4dtQuKjLu4Knw~Smooth but strong balanced drinks,  amazing decor and perfectly fried malt vinegar fries. Some of the best octopus I've ever had.  Just be mindful that portions are more like tapas but very attentive waiters will describe everything eloquently  before the start of your meal.  Definitely going back to try the oysters!~fries. ~5
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~w3eiFFpo-S7gcHwj4P5YeQ~Ate there last night we were a party of 7, while it did take us some time to go through the wine list, we had a hard time finding something suitable for everyone, luckily the second bottle we ordered was pretty good but also expensive at 80 for a bottle of local wine from Norman Hardie, I will say though the waiter was very good in explaining the wines. Food service took some time and while we initially ordered oysters it took easily 30 minutes to get them out. We had a variety of sides but had to ask for more and at $6 for a plate of olives it's a bit pricey. The Cauliflower was pretty good but very salty, the shrimp and grits were excellent. In terms of mains I had the quail which was served on a piece of toast with a corn type salad, it was not hearty at all and very boney, a little pricey for the amount of food served up. My wife had a steak as did a few others at the table, no one was really raving about it, I tried it and felt it was very buttery. The others had the seafood broth or whatever fancy french word they used, I tried it and it was very good, that was the winner at the table. Dessert unfortunately there was only one choice and no one went for it, i thought that was a bit sad to not offer more towards the end. Overall our bill came to just under 600 with tip, I feel that when there is a big party a restaurant should not bring down their service, nobody came to ask us how are food was, no one asked us if they can get us anything else, our wine glasses were touched up on once and there was no explanation of any food that was coming out of the kitchen except for the oysters. I thought that area was lacking. Nice atmosphere and we are lucky we had good company, but overall this place is average as many places in Toronto and will have to get a little better in certain areas.  I would suggest maybe adding a few more items to the menu under mains and dessert.~cauliflower shrimp grits corn salad, steak ~3
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~KRg49TDyrYmS4WIe3Ak6tQ~On a desolate Sunday night, Marie and I wandered off the streets into this undiscovered restaurant (at least to us) like some sort of lucid vagabonds.    We heard that our good friend Alex (former chef of Farmhouse) was back in town and had recently taken the reigns of this Parkdale restaurant.. not to mention that Geraldine was on our "places to go" list for quite some time anyway... So it seemed like the perfect time to go.   As soon as we walked in, we fell into a time-warp and instantly we were transported to the 1920s during prohibition. The vibe was cool and calm, the staff was warm and friendly.   First, the drinks.... Marie had warned me about the prices of the drinks and I couldn't understand why they charged so much for cocktails.  Needless to say, I ate my words in the form of a beverage.  Easily the best cocktails in the city, no contest.   Michael is a wizard behind the bar, constructing his elixirs right in the open for on-lookers to see.  I was thrilled to see REAL Absinthe on the cocktail menu, but I was even more excited when I saw how he prepared it and presented it.  I am not going to spoil it for you, you just have to see for yourself... Amazing.   Our server Brendan offered up some oysters from East Coast to West Coast.  This guy knew his shit and you could tell he took pride in his work.  He took care of us for the evening, we never felt rushed and it was completely relaxing.... or perhaps that was the Absinthe talking?  For me, Chef Molitz' challenge was going to be finding his stride within the French realm of cooking and technique.  This is a stark contrast to the rustic Modern-Canadian style that we are all use to from Alex.  So this dinner was going to be interesting, at least from the point of view of a French food geek like myself.   There is a reason why Alex is revered as one of Toronto's best; his ability to serve up consistent, rich flavours that are on point and familiar to the senses.  The Duck Croquette reminded me of childhood dinners of mash potatoes and turkey at Thanksgiving.  And the Duck Confit was crispy and salty just as it should be, served with bean cassoulet that was smokey and creamy.   Delicious.   If I had to order one thing on the menu, (aside from the Absinthe of course) it would be the Vietnamese Coffee and Chocolate Chip cookies.  It simply hits all the right areas.  Geraldine is a classic.~coffee chocolate chip cookies ~5
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~zcqH6Kdyx_tn1GxrgnDhNQ~Really beautiful little date spot with fantastic oysters, small plates, and absinthe cocktails. If you're lucky, you'll get a live show by a charming piano player at the end of the night.   I'm looking forward to many more meals here. It's a great addition to the neighbourhood.~date ~4
3num8fBJ9Z0T_HfshUNcrA~oi4CFcR_dnh0yG8f3F9Olw~My go to, my comfort zone, my favourite spot! Alas, suddenly it closed on August 20. No farewell, no fanfare. I was lucky to have visited it a few weeks before. They had new cocktails, and Alex, the owner was with us again that night. She is truly incredible. If there was ever someone who made you feel welcome, catered to, accommodating, all of it, it was her. I'll never forget being allowed to peek into their kitchen and buy a full log of foie gras bouchon! Alex, the chef, explained the process and ingredients, it all made sense then. Oysters were always great, as well as their charcuterie platter, ceviche, streak tartare, duck confit croquettes..sigh. Bye bye world class cocktails, prepared with so much love and precision. Charlemagne, Fountain and Parisienne Milk Punch!  Please return in another reincarnation.~ceviche, croquettes.. milk ~5
6UiBaTM6_ENF_L53C0CHTw~nrTgFPrKu5h4zyZZ-Xof8A~This is the absolute worst place in Downtown Champaign (other than Phoenix), and I mean that in the best way possible. On a Friday night, the place was near deserted after about 10:30pm, with a regular or two, a couple of drunks and a group of quiet students. Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs. My kind of place.  They have 2 beers on tap as I recall, PBR and High Life. The special that night was Hamm's cans, which were had for (surprisingly, to me) more than a dollar each. The good news is that either Hamm's is a lot better than I remember, or I was drunker than I thought. I had been drinking 'good' beer at other downtown establishments known for the same, but the Hamm's were somehow better. Thinking about how well those Hamm's hit the spot makes me want one right now.  The Brass Rail has an internet juke box to kill the otherwise oppressive silence, and is a total ripoff if you put less than $5 in, but has an impressive selection. They have a soft-tip dartboard, a couple of tvs and a broken pinball machine. They also have frozen pizza that they can make for you for less than $5, but it is pretty crappy pizza. Huber's' pizza is way better. Ours got burnt black in places and was too salty but  was still promptly devoured. For two days I wondered how I burned my mouth.  Service is great, and friendly. The bartender has an excellent rapport with her patrons, a quick wit and a kindness that comes across right away. I can definitely see this as a place to go back to.~pizza pizza pizza ~4
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~X5szfBdkObEaW2rEab9W7g~another F & E grocery store.. i can't help myself..i love shopping at fresh and easy. this one is bright and clean and normally is fully stocked.  i usually pop in for the veggies, pop chips, hummus, chicken. you can find some great deals on their veggies. if you really want to save money- they have an aisle of items getting ready to expire that day and you can get those items for 50 percent off!   i will let you in on my favorite treats:  spongecake and a dollop of fat free whip and fresh strawberries yummy!~chips, chicken. ~4
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~Qjq3eH38teSVTkHVIktvZQ~I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.   I LOVE it!   I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.   The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!   My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)  Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!   I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!   Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!~pasta, chicken tomato soup mac and cheese ~5
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~bHxW3A1lsL8tiM2F-VMMfg~The short story on F&E and why I shop here:  - I can be in and out (when I have my checklist) in less than 10min, no lines, ever! - Open 8am-10pm, so I can go before work or after work and again, no lines - free food tasting in case you're hungry and want to munch on something while you shop - carry these "Eat Well" options that have salmon and veggies and aren't carb loaded - quick lunch spot - "Friends" reward card is easy to earn points and redeem them for grocery credit - their staff is helpful but not annoying - have quite a bit of options and variety considering it's a small grocery space - clearance aisle is kick butt and offers great savings~salmon ~4
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~T_wfQqluhCCWOjefHZZQSQ~so check it out: they have these prepackaged meals in the back that you just pop in the microwave and BAM!, there's dinner. well I'm not one to sacrifice on taste so I was really thrilled with the chicken masala.  4 and a half minutes later I was eating some pretty tasty lunch, and it only cost 479 or whatever (if I were literate I would have read that if I purchased three there would have been a 20% discount).  Also tasted the bacon and cheese quiche, not microwaveable but really exceptional.  My good man dallas g. bought two types of hummus, both largely satisfactory and more!  (spicy jalapeno hummus and roasted red pepper hummus...)  But on the way home, we passed this guy in a late-model convertible mustang, top up, windows closed, wearing his fuck-me sunglasses and smoking a cigar?!?!  So I take away one star for that because any business situated this close to that type of douchebaggery needs to be smacked down, and smacked down hard.  I am quite certain that were we able to see the whole wardrobe there would be socks with tevas going on down below.  Or crocs.  same diff.  But I add one star back for the fact that you can pretty much get any bag of veggies and just pop them in the micro for a nice steamed side dish, or all their meats that look good, or the fact that capn crunch was the first thing I saw on the way in.  It's all good, after all.~chicken bacon cheese jalapeno ~5
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~SyMTQdEpPrm9KIEyJYZS9Q~Fresh and Easy is a nice, quick stop for something satisfying to eat. As a general rule, I don't usually do the majority of my grocery shopping here. Their produce seems very overpriced to me and being that veggies are the primary food group for my family, it does not make much sense for me. However, their pre-made meals are great. The soups are delicious and we frequently grab one of their pasta dinners to share for dinner. Their breakfast burritos are also pretty good :) For what it offers, this is a good place to buy your groceries--just don't go into it expecting the variety of goods you may see at Fry's.~pasta burritos ~4
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~K47aGfsIbdl7KJDKlN3FMw~Some would wonder why bother to review a chain?  Well each store is different from the other and it largely depends on the managment and the employees.  Sure most Fresh & Easy stores have the same things.  They have great, fresh prepackaged meals.  They have daily specials.  They have veggies or fruit for 98 cents....yes, that's what I said....98 cents!  They also have a case full of things that need to be sold or they will be past their freshness date so they mark them down for quick sale.  Score if you are needing something quick for that very evening!  And their prices are lower than Fry's, Safeway, Basha's or just about anywhere else.  I once purchansed two weeks worth of food for $35 at Fresh and Easy.  Most everything I bought was on sale or just darn cheap!!  Their gallons of milk are only $1.98!  You can't beat that!    This particular Fresh and Easy is just up the street from my house.  It's always clean and well stocked.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  So if you're in the neighboorhood and need something, even bringing some beer or wine to a friends place, stop in to this Fresh and Easy.  It's a great one in my book!~date milk ~5
Elt5g53dYiIICTFJ09NbgA~NmjDQLzOgRjoTm_uo7DsMA~This is definitely a great place to go to for a quick healthy meal. I got a salmon and BBQ pork here for 2 separate meals. It takes no more than 30 minutes to prep them and the portion is good enough for 2 people. I also got some crackers and meat to make bruschetta and it was so delicious. Staffs are friendly and the supermarket is very organized. I am so glad that it is located in Chandler.   The only reason I didnt give it a 5 versus 4 is because their items are very pricy. I'm sure it might help lowering the cost if I have coupons (which I don't).   I will definitely come back here again.~salmon bbq pork ~4
1txYN5mh8kghO_Js8I48sg~Hb9nTKGgyx-Ds-kqBoqJww~This is one of those places which in theory is great to have around. A mall/plaza with a Health Clinic, a convenience store, a Goodwill to buy cheap books, glassware/cutlery and the odd piece of clothing --you might be surprised at the quality! A Rexall, a shoe repair place, a sushi place, Swiss Chalet and even a Mc'D's. Plus a few others, however, the entire place has a surreal and depressing vibe to it.   I do not know what it is. Is it the cheap-vibed, slightly-out-of-Fight-Club lighting? The lame green/pink plastic colour scheme of the interior decour? Or just the down in their luck look that most patrons seem to have in this place. Just look into the McD's and you will notice a lot of people there seem, you know, to be just hanging out and kill time. For a LONG time.   Don't get me wrong, as stated above, this place has it's advantages and usefulness if you leave nearby. Which I did, I was about 5 minutes west towards Yonge and Bloor but I have to say, this is one of those places where you walk in, do what you need to do and get the heck out because when the most cheery looking place in the whole "mall" is the Rexall, then you know, this place can and will bum you out.~sushi swiss ~2
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~FDFt3KhVu3n8z3W3Cabc5Q~My name is David and I am addicted to sweets. I started my day with a trip to Crepe Shack and still stopped at Sweet Ruby Jane to look at their selection of desserts.  For a long time I thought that the Southeast was falling behind to Summerlin, but not any more. The growth of unique, affordable, and fun eateries has made it so that I rarely venture up north anymore.   SRJ offers many delectable treats for a reasonable price. Before committing to anything, they offer tastings of the day. The macadamia white fudge is magnificent. They were not pieces of the nut, but actual whole ones mixed into the confection. Since I had eaten my amount of sweets for the day, I had picked up a piece of pumpkin cake ($2.25) and a package of peanut butter cookies ($3) for my parents. I took a bite of the cake while sitting with my mom and it was moist, had the signature taste of fall, and not sickeningly sweet. The cookies were on sale since they were not made that day. A pack of four large cookies were only $3. I felt them and they were still soft.   They were doing a test run on seasoned roast nuts. The curry one was nice, but needed more spice. The lady behind the counter was very receptive about suggestions. Nice to see people wanting an honest opinion instead of asking and turning a deaf ear.~desserts. white pumpkin cake ( peanut butter ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~2YfD9BmCMesSfZpgExnTdg~After picking my son up late from pre-school/daycare he asked for a "cake-pop" and happy to oblige I headed toward Starbucks. We turned in to the drive through and like a beacon in the night I saw the back door of Sweet Ruby Janes touting "cake-pops". I'd been intrigued before and this was my chance.   To my surprise they were giving away free anniversary cake pops, which was fab-u-lous. So Gibson chose a red velvet cake pop and I went to the tea wall. What a pleasant surprise, I picked out a Sunny Passion tea, got a chocolate nut bar for Patrick and let Gibson pick out a couple more pieces; a raspberry butterfly sucker and a white chocolate covered Oreo.   Oh, and thanks to the kind saleswoman I got a cake pop too!  I didn't even make it to the freezer for the icy treats, which is my soft spot.  I'll be back to check it out.  And the decor . . . is adorable. Just the shop you want to pick out delicious candies and teas from.   By the way, everything was delicious.  Choco covered Oreo was unbelievable, it had such a nice thick coating of white chocolate.  The fact that I was tardy was completely forgotten!~cake- cake- cake cake tea tea, white oreo. cake oreo white ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~pxTKz9Adsfi6f2N0f8bmww~Very cute store! Came in here because i thought there would be some cupcakes, but there wasn't any :( Lots of lovely decorated treats behind the counter! The lady who helped me said the chocolate dipped pretzels were the most popular so I picked up one ($1.85). I could see another person in the back with a bag of Snyders pretzels dipping them in chocolate. The pretzel honestly was just Ok, nothing too special. These little treats can definitely be made at home! I might be back if I was in the area or needed a fast gift for someone.~cupcakes, ~3
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~Kb8JHOnOJDCzlnlcEFI72g~Came here for a tea tasting (they also sell tea from a local proprietor), and found out I love this place!  I am a bit of a chocolate snob, so the first thing I noticed was the white chocolate has a bit of yellow to it- this is good people!  White chocolate that is too white looks that way because more fat and sugar has been added to stretch it, none of those cheap tricks here.  I also like that it's a small family business (owners are sisters, Ruby Jane was their grandmother), which I always feel good supporting.  Alright, enough rambling, onto the chocolate!  What I had: White chocolate bark with caramel and toasted coconut.  My favorite item :) and one of the cheaper ones since it didn't have heavy stuff like caramel and peanut butter (most items are priced by weight).  Macadamia and cashew caramel nut clusters with dark chocolate?  Well OK, if you twist my arm!  SO yummy, and used whole nuts.  White chocolate covered almonds.  Simple and tasty, would get these again.  Dark chocolate peanut butter cup, probably my least favorite thing.  It was still good, but not out of this world.  Dark chocolate covered caramel.  Excellent caramel, but I like mine topped with a nice sea salt for the sweet/salty flavor combo, and their version didn't have that touch.~tea tea white white white white caramel coconut. caramel peanut butter ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~0P7um90kfjx-gNcLjfJLFw~I love the people that work there. They are not as good or have the selection of Layers, Freeds, maybe even  dainty cakes but what they do, they do well. They have some top notch cookies and gourmet-esque cup cake/muffins.~cookies ~3
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~9xt4l8WtPqn4BSQCyhJmkQ~Super cute little sweet shop and bonus it's next to a Starbucks because these treats go great with a coffee!   Lots of choices and if you're a chocolate lover prepare your waistline. The chocolate covered grahams were awesome and the toffee (and maybe another ingredient?) brittle was great too.   Nothing crazy about the prices, seemed pretty fair. The guy who helped me was nice and seemed happy to have someone stop in. I haven't been back in but it'd be a great place to grab some treats to bring to the family over the holidays!~coffee! ~3
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~tWzZqoqTlG8RLozgGe-z6w~Where to start! Saw it just opened, and I love sweets! My coworker and I walked over to check it out and tried a bunch of things, and I must say, bravo! Ill be a frequent flyer here.   Try their banana bread cupcakes. I only.know one person who makes baked goods this well, and thats my momma back in chicago. these guys have great service and a welcoming little store. Ill be back for sure. :)~banana cupcakes. ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~xuiF6L32xY10r7gGp_LdQg~I didn't know much about Sweet Ruby Jane Confections, before walking in the door. It's right next to Starbucks and has really cute Vintage Style signage and colors, so I decided to take the kids inside for a treat before getting coffee at Starbucks.   It has a small storefront, which is fine for a candy store. Let me say, that I was expecting it to be more of a candy store, it really seemed to have more Chocolatey treats. No complaints from the kids about that though. We were greeted by friendly counter staff, offered several samplings for free, and finally my kids decided on a marshmallow, chocolate covered treat on a stick. They were about $2 each, tasted fine and the kids liked them. Not sure if it was the right selection for $2 a piece though.   They have a birthday club, where you sign up and get free stuff on your birthday. I need to go back to sign up.   The friendly lady behind the counter also told us that they do birthday parties for kids, where they made some sort of treat. I'm definitely going to check this out when birthday time rolls around again. It sounds like it would be a lot of fun for kids.~coffee ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~3Zo_6jYLiJEachpdblld5A~The confections were very tasty, we had a dark chocolate turtle, a piece of toffee bark, and a birthday cake pop. The young girl helping us wasnt friendly though so the cuteness and welcoming feel to the store was cheapened a bit by her dulness. Great candy though!~cake ~3
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~eDMoQSzmqGooQzNZZgAFXg~Peanut butter blossom cookies are awesome, as are the sugar free chocolate covered pretzels!  Will be back soon!~peanut butter ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~0Z2ssHFMUDFUFFYNaLgcvA~I love this place.  So many options ranging from baked treats to chocolates and even ice cream sandwhiches.  I have been here before and got some baked goods which I don't recall what they were but they were great.  Today I stopped in and got some sugar free chocolate candy which was great and I also got an ice pop made with fruit to have for later.  This is a great place for when you have a sweet tooth or even a place to get sweet gifts for somebody.~ice cream ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~EkvYMWZKONs2CTOle4wIJQ~What a cute shop!! Not to mention, they have a little bit of everything.   We couldn't resist a trip in after breakfast at the neighboring Sunrise Cafe. There were loads of seasonal treats to choose from. We picked up some cute rice krispie treat ghosts for a little gift. They came in a cute bag too!   I indulged in a delightful, chewy, cookie. Only $1. Yum.  They had suckers, chocolates, ice cream, cookies, cake pops and more.   I would highly recommend it for a bday or hostess gift or holiday treat for your favorite bambino.   Stop in and splurge.~ice cream, cookies, cake ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~YbmSEGcv7u2xCqY6CZX1fA~I stumbled upon this place when my wife called for emergency Pho from Saigon 8 (same parking lot.) I had 10 minutes to kill and I was already going to be a victim of pho bloat so I figured I had nothing to lose.  The place is charming as hell, everything is blue and appears to be hand made. We got several huge cookies which were extremely reasonably priced, some nut/chocolate combos that were excellent and one exquisite red velvet cookie. Red velvet cookie. It was rad. The cake pops were the only thing I'd call mediocre.  Also the bell is loud enough to make you poop your pants. The confectioner who assisted me said it was because the bakery (rear of the shop, rather large) was loud and they had to be able to hear customers.  Will return. Better value than expected.~cookies cake bell ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~Lb5QdXmUAcOFJSGzTo3Fag~My wife and I stopped in after leaving Vegas for a few days of losing money and seeing good shows.  Ruby Jane was so sweet to us and extremely helpful in explaining each of the chocolates to us.  The pumpkin bread is amazing and actually everything in our box of chocolates was pretty tasty.  Great job!~pumpkin ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~VGCy68j8hWVSKK9Tg2drzw~Another stop (actually, make that 3 stops already, and counting) on my ongoing bakery tour of Las Vegas. I was kind of skeptical of Sweet Ruby Jane's because it seemed like a blatant rip-off of the famous Sweet Lady Jane bakery in LA. It may be that, but I don't care because this Jane has delicious treats. I think I have sampled all of the cookies and they are all good, but the best are the oatmeal (it doesn't even taste like oatmeal! more like a light sugar cookie with an oat-y texture) and the toffee. So good. They are big, thin cookies, so not too doughy, but they are still soft. I also had the chocolate-dipped pretzels (good) and several of the dipped marshmallows (milk chocolate, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee...delicious!). I see reviews for chocolate-covered grahams, so I will definitely be trying those next. The little store is super cute, with outdoor seating (kinda sucks if the weather is hot, cold, or windy) and the owner was very friendly.  Also of note were the prices here - $9 for a dozen cookies! In the bakery world, that's pretty reasonable. And I can't remember the exact price, but I think the marshamallows are about $0.50 each.~cookies cookies, milk caramel, cookies! ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~GZfWojuoSCDGNCvpHiPjmw~A great local confectioner. I love the chocolate covered peanut brittle and the chocolate covered caramel corn. I love that everything is named after family and friends.~caramel corn. ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~PmVAZvwgMkQ9fMKjWskRwQ~This place has very good chocolate treats.  I love the selection of s'mores pretzels, caramels, and other chocolate goodies.  Most of their items come with either milk or dark chocolate.  And they sell milk to wash it down with.  I really like the quality of the chocolate and how helpful the employees were there.  I will be back because this place rocks!~milk milk ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~Jbb3gDgGo6Juqhgi07bICg~note - as of this writing address listed on Yelp is still the old location. New location address is  9550 S. Eastern #110. Already submitted change on 9/7.  New location, same sweet super cute place. They're all moved into their new home over at Sansone Park Place. Sweet Ruby Janes still the same sweet shop that specializes in homemade candies and sweet treats like cake pops and cookies.  At a Yelp event they attended (Rock N Roll KissMas) I met the owners when they had cake pops and learned all the treats made in their shop are recipes handed down by the owners grandma.  My (and Mr. B's) favorite confections gotta be their butter toffees. Especially the toffee chip cookies. Their toffee brittle is smooth,shiny and tastes so buttery. You dont have to bite too hard to break off a piece.    You will also find oreo, pretzels and TWINKIES dipped in CHOCOLATE!. I like that they are individually wrapped with cute packaging and make fun little surprise gifts for those "just cause" occasions.   Now that they're in the strip mall with some of the restaurants I frequent (Cafe Zupas) I'll pop in more when I need to get cookies at their happy hour...and who knows I might even share them with ya!~cake cookies. cake butter cookies. oreo, cookies ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~s8TW1OajkvgucLUMcWfs_Q~Since I was near by...thought I'd drop by this decorative shop full of Sweetz! :)   We bought 2 chocolate chip cookies and an Oatmeal crisp.  The chocolate chip cookies were a bit of a disappointment as they were a bit too cake-like/spongy (too much eggs in them).  The chocolate chips were tasty and not overly sweet.  The batter was good as well, unfortunately...I like my cookies a bit more...firm.    I'm not much of an Oatmeal cookie kinda girl but I couldn't pass up the oatmeal crisp.  Just as the lady behind the counter stated, it was one of their best treats and I couldn't agree with more.    They had an array of samples out.  Good for customer service, good for business.   Will be coming back to this great little shop. :) Starbucks next door, watch out!  TK~chocolate chip cookies ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~Yv46ZZfXaL9McONXL-SaxA~Friendly service! Nice layout and presentation. We had a lil of this and that all of it was devine!  Chocolate chip cookie-humungo! Soft with slightly crispy edges.  Brownie crinkle-also big it was sweet,chocolatey and  moist. Sugar free dark chocolate raisin and almond drops-surprisingly tasty! M&M/chocolate covered pretzel-yummy Peanut butter cup-delicious. Over all everything we had was amazing.~raisin almond peanut butter ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~-_sY3MrDCDsUY7Nqr-hphA~People who are too sweet irritate me but Ruby Jane is as sweet as you can get and I'm not irritated yet. One visit is all it takes to keep you wanting to come back. First of all their sign is so eye catching from the road and the size of the sign makes it easy to spot. Right when you walk in you are instantly drawn to the many varities of chocolate everythings.... The Smores with caramel is freakin awsome as well as those Oatmeal Crispies. I was hestitant to eat an Oatmeal Crispie as I only enjoy chewy cookies and it says it's crisp. The lady behind the counter told me that's it's crisp around the edges but chewy inside and boy was she right. You can taste all the butter- trust me this cookie is a winner. Another winner for me was the Chocolate Crinkle cookie - tastes just like a dark chocolate brownie. There were lots of festive Halloween goodies to be had. I bought a rice krispie dipped in chocolate on a stick and a large marshmallow dipped in white and dark chocolate on a stick with eyes for my kid. She equally loved both of them. My sister loved her turtle.... A miss for me was what seemed like a saltine cracker dipped in chocolate. I bought it because it said that is was a salty/sweet treat and I like salty/sweet but this didn't work for me. However, someone else may really like this- there's always something for someone right?.... If you sign up to be part of their club every month you get to have a good sized sample of their new item. For October it was Pecan Brittle and the Lady said for December it very well might be Peppermint Bark - so sign up- - it's free!!!! The Lady also let me sample the Pumpkin Fudge - Yummy!!!  My mouth is happy that this place is close to home but my bootie isn't - Sweet Ruby Jane is my new habit.......~caramel cookies white pumpkin ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~0obSe6XBrWwi8NsaPmlvPg~I AM THAT KID IN THE CANDY STORE  After eating dinner next door at Greens and Proteins, my friend and I walked by and I did a double take, not realizing Sweet Ruby Jane's was in the same shopping plaza--score!  Two bookmarked places in one night!  Alas, it was 6:20pm and before we could get inside, one of the ladies was already locking the door--closing time was 6:00pm!  As we stood peeking through the windows at the goodies inside, the kind lady had pity on us and unlocked the door-- talk about sweet customer service!  Because I then felt pressure to hurry and up and not delay their closing for the night, I didn't get a good look at everything Sweet Ruby Jane's had to offer, but what I did see  was delectable.  Chocolate-covered strawberries, pretzels, cake pops, chocolate-covered Almond Rocha (my favorite candy!), peanut brittle, and more.  We chose a few of the pretzels, a cake pop, and a brownie pop--for a sugar addict like me, that's nothing.  I highly recommend this place for its freshly made sweets and the outstanding customer service--you know I'll be back, giving myself plenty of time to browse the selection and spend more on the sugar.~greens cake almond cake ~5
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~y9XqeZZL1efkps30jUGniA~Super cute shop!  Love the whole look and vibe.  They have a lot of candy and some baked goods.  My son got a few different of the old school candies they had, that was after I talked him out of the starburst...really you want starburst of all things?  I got a red velvet cake pop and some chocolate covered animal crackers.  Both were good.  I wish I would have got some of their chocolates, so I guess that is what I will get next time.  Prices were good and service was friendly.  We didn't see any samples or sign ups for a e-club or birthday club.  Will have to look harder next time or ask.  We will def be back.~cake ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~WvKOSD2MdJtvosjOaS_e7A~Yum Yum Yum! After eating a healthy meal at Proteins and Greens next store I walked by this little gem( at least I had a healthy lunch haha). I decided just to go inside and take a look at what they were offering and was immediately offered a delicious sample. I tried this delicious nut cluster thing and it was just amazing. I ended up getting an oatmeal crisp and my bf got a slice of the pumpkin cake. The cake was really moist and not overly sweet and the oatmeal cookie was just perfect. I've been back 2 more times since then and everything has been delicious. You've got to check it out if you are in the area. Oh and try the white chocolate peanut butter fudge mmmm!~greens pumpkin cake. cake white peanut butter ~4
0aKsGxx7XP2TMs_fn_9xVw~_kPLOxC5ZvMGokzO6Al8uw~Just as I was trying to stop eating sweets Sweet Ruby Jane moves in next door!  The good news is they make a great selection of sugar free candy!  My favorite is the sugar free chocolate-covered almonds...Awesome!    They make everything fresh there and the cookies are amazing because of that.    That and the owners are very nice people!~cookies ~5
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~YU55J7iMoTDU6IEKuXTHhQ~Amazing donuts and very friendly service! Best kept secret at this place? Chicken empanadas! Delicious, flaky pastry encase a delectable meat filling. Two of these make a yummy and convenient lunch, specially when served with a salad or soup. They only have these mon-Saturday, and is often sold out in the afternoon.~chicken salad soup. ~4
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~0mU7oEcRD6ZiR1_-UnnFuA~It's great having this little bakery in the neighborhood! It's our one stop shop to pick up a loaf of bread, some hot dog buns and pandesal. I really like their empanadas and ensaymada as well. I really have to lay off their little cakes and donuts though.  The little store front is very functional, but they really should spruce up the joint.~hot dog ~4
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~RgO8yaa0iylQpzIEi6Vszg~I was in the area and I heard really good things about this place so I thought I would give it a try. Aww.....delicious I absolutely love this place. The donuts were to die for.  I mean literally if you eat too much you could die. I.really like the chocolate crossaint. The front desk was very friendly and patient. The parking wasnt too bad, just be careful cars are  crazy here.  There was a line up which tells me that if you go early you will get a better selection. I think I should avoid this place for my waist line but those pastries...my mind says I must go back!~pastries... ~5
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~wFyzmi0XQ3rNrAhbWwlezA~This was really close to a 5 star rating. My wife and I stopped in here because we needed some bread.  Our first time here we were pleasantly greeted by a lady behind the counter. We picked up our loaf and proceeded to check out the pastries and donuts.  I opted for a dutchie and my wife got a cheese Danish. The dutchie was *really* good it was just sweet enough and fresh. My wife loved her Danish, fresh and yummy. We also got 2 coffees to go. This was our only complaint I prefer a stronger coffee and this didn't cut it for me.  If the coffee was a bit better this would easily be a 5*.  Some of the baked treats we've had in a while. Great prices.~pastries cheese coffee coffee ~4
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~Mzs88bOJi_BUVs6dcy7efA~Still 5-star worthy in 2014. I'm not here year-round, so I only get to check in a few times a year, but everything is as I remember in my last (more extensive) review.    As Vijaya notes in her review, the donuts are yeast variety, which I don't usually like because of their consistency (I usually prefer the denser cake-donut variety). But here they do something to give the very light donut a bit of a crunch. I put it down to "magic".  Vijaya also notes that the Boston creme filling is spread, not injected - I see this as preferable to a big glob in one quarter of the donut, because you get creme in every bite.  To each their own, I guess.   On my visits this summer, I was overjoyed to see BUTTER TARTS. I'd asked in prior years if they ever made them, and was told "only around Christmas", but by popular request they had them, and on special for $4.50 for 6!  These are not huge tarts, but they are excellent, and for comparable quality they would be twice the price at "The Flaky Tart" and other winning tart makers. I'm not a fan of raisins in my butter tarts, and P.U.B. makes them with and without, also a plus for me.~cake- butter butter ~5
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~cv1ESa0Ttxj2ocbMuRCx8Q~This is such a nice bakery on Port union road, and has the best no fuss coffee. ( To me). They re donuts are nothing like anything you get at a Timmys, starbucks, country style, anywhere but a small bakery that makes they re own donuts. They re a bit crispy, even the yeast donuts, but not stale, Ive never had a stale donut from this place. They re a good size, and they re cheap.  .  Now they re coffee, its just really good simple coffee!. I have no idea if its fair trade or any of that and really I dont care, its always fresh, and never burnt tasting. I cant go on about coffee because I dont know all the fancy lingo people used to describe it, but its GOOD!.~coffee. coffee, coffee ~4
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~TK28UTvuacKn-CgM4xfdyQ~Port Union bakery is exactly what you would expect from your local bakery.  A small local bakery, that is.  They offer usual variety of breads (white, whole wheat and multi grain loaves, some buns and dinner rolls, banana bread...etc), small snacks like sausage rolls and Jamaican patties...etc) and pastries in a tiny 200 Sqft store with barely enough room to move around with a stroller.    Since the store is owned by Filipino people (I think), they also offer Ensaymada which I have yet to try but will update this review once I do.    What they offer is a good old basic staples so if you're craving a nice crusty baguette or a buttery flaky croissant, this place may not do it for you.  But for your everyday need for the basic stuff, you can be certain that you'll be served with a smile.~breads ( white, wheat banana sausage pastries ~3
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~yvZcpr6AqGJRdrue5cMNww~I've been eating food from here for over 10 years & I think it's worth checking out if you're in the area! It's a no frills kinda bakery. Nothing very fancy, take out only, kinda out dated. The people working here are very sweet & make some yummy food.   Best time to come is early in the morning to get it while it's still hot. My personal favourite thing they make are donuts! Super yummy! They also make awesome muffins, cookies, pudding, croissants! I'm personally not the biggest fan of the buns because they're a little sweet for my liking but my Mom adores them.   I'd stop by if you're in the area!~cookies, ~4
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~bNE3NFdTpiU2fCwvdAp_sA~I love their chicken and beef empanadas. First time I had them was back 2006 at my cousin's wedding. Whenever my cousins come visit me or vice versa these empanadas needs to come home with me.   One time thought it was way tooo much pepper.~chicken beef ~5
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~s8zWbWsCKllNRBIyPZmlJg~Port Union Bakery was one of those places, based on reviews, that I really wanted to like.  For one, it's a neighborhood joint, family run. Also, the thought of local fresh baked goods was alluring, as I am a fiend for carbs. And, it's only a 10 minute drive from where I live, so total score right?  Well, here are my thoughts. I headed out this morning around 11 am to grab a doughnut or two. Prime time for baked goods, I would hope. They had quite the variety: Chocolate Dip, Vanilla Dip, Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar Twist, etc. All were yeast based I thought, or at least not cake doughnut-like.  I chose the Boston Cream, and Dutchie. They both had crumbly textures and were on the drier side. Disappointing :(  I had anticipated the fluffy, chewy texture associated with a yeast doughnut, and was totally let down. May be they use baking powder/soda here instead? I don't know. Moreover, the vanilla pudding/custard/cream in the Boston Cream was spread sparingly. No squishy, gooey goodness here.  I hate to say it, as I am one to root for the underdog, but Tim Hortons has better.  I may return to try their Empanadas down the road.~doughnut cake doughnut- doughnut, ~2
-FXxZWNlJ21jQKjc9UlHJg~4GDrIincDcODSYd1ZM7uzw~I don't eat sweets and instead go here for the whole wheat bread and hamburger buns.  Simply the freshest fluffy whole wheat in the area.~wheat hamburger wheat ~4
4FnGPKCbFwNcEsG0BdMDCg~IxtpQxs_zIPERaJ6MP1sig~Zum Abschluß eines kleinen Städtetrips sind wir der Empfehlung eines Reiseführers gefolgt und haben das Restaurant Goldfisch in Stuttgart aufgesucht. Ein tolles kleines Lokal. Geschmackvoll und nicht zu grell eingerichtet. Anders als andere asiatische Lokale. Der erste Eindruck war gut. Wir setzten uns neben die Theke und wurden auch direkt sehr freundlich bedient. Ich habe den hausgemachten Mango-Eistee getrunken. So wirklich lecker war er nicht, aber okay. Die Speisekarte ist umfangreich - für jeden etwas dabei. Wir bestellten Reis mit Gemüse und Huhn und eine Art Eintopf mit Kartoffeln und Erdnuss-Sauce. Das Essen war lecker und nett angerichtet. Nach unseren Erwartungen und den Preisen etwas wenig. Die Toiletten sind ein Abenteuer:)~mango- ~4
66m_zCy5JIDijS9F5OLC2A~n6zEr09OC7WigrxfQ4rjQQ~I like dressing nicely. In fact, I know more about fashion than the gf, even though she dress very well too. To my knowledge they biggest sale they have is like 10% or 15% off full priced items each year. I know, eh? I think twice a year they'll have 40% off sale, but the stuff I like is never on sale ... ANYWAY  Only going to talk about the men's shoes:  This store carries a great deal of both low-end and higher end shoes (mid-tier=churchs if you frequent SF). The thing about shoes in general is that most of the time, their price to quality ratio is pretty much on par. The more expensive the shoe is, the better quality it is (again, this is generally only for dress shoes).  That is true when it comes to high-end men's fashion, like Gaziano & Girling ($1500+), Crockett & Jones ($650+), Alden($500+), Carmina ($500+), and Allen Edmonds ($300 - 500). The aforementioned brands demonstrate QUALITY with an increasing price point.  However, this store carries some "fashionable" shoe brands like Mr. Hare, which is blake-welted shoe with corrected grain (I think) and priced at $900? That is ridiculous, considering I can buy a pair of Alden cordovans or Alfred Sargents for less money, which are both Goodyear Welted and far better quality! For example, they sell the brand "Fluevog", which seems to be cemented (sole is glued on / adhesive construction) for $300. That is preposterous! I can purchase a pair of Goodyear welted Allen Edmonds (full grain leather) for $300 when it's on sale (~4x a year in Toronto). The AE are better looking and the quality is exponentially better.  Secondly, some of the shoes here are out of date, namely some of the Church's styles. Note that Church's quality has fallen with being acquired by Prada. *Edit: They keep both old and new stock.  Gravity Pope seem to not offer any discounts on their old stock if it's "brand name", like Arcteryx Veilance and Church's, even though if it's from the seasons before. They need to realize that other stores in Toronto are offering large markdowns on their old stock at the end of the season to bring in the new stock...like Harry Rosen. Gravity Pope needs to hire better pricing strategists because I personally feel much of the stuff will be hard to sell with the exuberant prices now.~date, ~3
0-aoCkMjQqoOCr04QYZ1dA~JD_2Du-oi007xbXx3e1HKA~Went in for 2 iced coffees and an egg Mcmuffin. NEVER in my life did I think it would take me over 30 minutes to first place my order with one of the most incompetent cashiers I have ever seen in my 16 years of being in the service industry myself. I had to say 3 times to her alone what type of coffee I wanted, along with another 3 times to tell her I wanted it with ice. She then handed me the smallest hot coffee I have ever seen. She then, with an attitude the ENTIRE time, got a manager to come and help her. She then made me a coffee after I had to tell her twice as well what I wanted. She hands me two of the smallest ice coffees I have ever seen. I asked the cashier with an attitude if it was actually a medium because I am in shock as to how small it is. She grabs it out of my hand and holds the cup up while pointing to a small M on the side of it. I tasted both of the shit coffees they gave me. One tasted like chocolate milk and the other one tasted like straight espresso. What I ordered was two iced French Vanilla lattes, add mocha and add an extra turbo shot. I literally order this from a couple different McDonald's and know it's something they make. So. I then ask the bitch cashier to see a manager because at this point I'm just furious. She informs me the lady that made my coffees was my manager but her gm was also there. So I asked to speak to him. She stands there just yelling his name. I literally laughed to myself. The gm comes out from the back. He happens to be the man who I heard at the counter a few minutes before then telling the staff and pretty much anybody in there how he had to deal with another store being robbed of 487 dollars. Like. I'm an assistant gm. I have been a gm. You do NOT come in and act like that as a gm. I ask him if he can remake my coffee because they are not correct and taste like shit. I tell him what I want and he basically was telling me in a nut shell what I order at least 3 times a week, isn't possible. He luckily made me the coffees I asked for. And again with more attitude hands me my tiny ass little coffee. Then as I try to say thank you, he just pretends I'm not standing there and keeps commanding his lazy incompetent staff on where trash cans should be. Like come the fuck on Robert M. I think you paying attention to customer service, food times and what you're actual job entails rather than standing there bitching like a high school child. Literally no sooner did I turn around, another lady had come inside complaining about how she had been waiting 20 minutes for a caramel frappe. Somebody higher up needs to handle this store and teach their employees to have manners as well as know what they are supposed to be doing. It's common sense on how you treat people in restaurants, fast food or not. I will literally NEVER step foot into that place again and by the end of the day will be calling district managers and whoever else I can. I would recommend waiting at Dunkin Doughnuts where it would at least have been well worth the wait. Not feeling like I'm an inconvenience to somebody who is paid to do their job correctly and serve the customers who want what they paid for. Go back to school kids.~egg coffee coffee coffee milk coffee coffee. caramel doughnuts ~1
-G3_XsupUt7DGeAxnjgNEw~foikSDnSbRFQLVDOrTfMcA~Durant l'été, le circuit Gilles Villeneuve est un endroit formidable pour rouler en vélo ou en roller-blade. La quasi absence de trafic routier sur le site en fait un endroit très sécuritaire pour s'adonner à son sport préféré. À cause de son revêtement conçu expressément pour la course automobile, il s'agit de la route la mieux entretenue de Montréal. C'est aussi un bon endroit pour courir si l'on préfère les longs parcours plats. À vélo, l'endroit est accessible par la piste cyclable du pont de la Concorde via le vieux Montréal. Pour le roller-blade ou la course à pied, je vous suggère d'utiliser le métro ou le pont Jacques Cartier.   Bien sûr, la semaine du grand-prix, le circuit fait place aux amateurs de F1. Il devient donc inaccessible aux cyclistes et autres promeneurs. L'endroit devient bondé de touristes internationaux attirés par l'atmosphère glamour du grand cirque de la F1. À ce moment, les prix de la restauration sur l'île frôlent le ridicule. Je conseil aux amateurs de course d'apporter un gouter, ce qui vous fera économiser beaucoup. Malgré cela, l'Île Notre-Dame reste la destination F1 la plus abordable au monde !  En conclusion, le CGV est à découvrir, surtout lorsque la F1 n'est pas de passage à Montréal. Vous découvrirez un endroit paisible, dans un milieu naturel et charmant. Le calme garanti.~sport ~4

3vxNIpEg5SmmInek0b7ulQ~WsMCx2zJeVhD5Xfbdje-dQ~Well how could you not be a fan of self-serve frozen yogurt?  This place is inside the Overstreet by Chik-fil-A.  It is a small spot but there is limited seating available.    You can mix your favorite flavors together to fit your palette!  They have great non-fat options including coconut and chocolate and others.  The birthday cake tastes like plain vanilla though fyi.  At 42 cents per ounce you can right-size your order!  They have a ton of toppings such as chopped pecans, marshmellows, fruit, coconut flakes etc etc...Love it!  :-D~frozen yogurt? coconut cake coconut ~4
3vxNIpEg5SmmInek0b7ulQ~wKWpxarJ8364LC_D0iE9ug~Frozen Isle is located hidden in the Bank of America building, so if you try to find it from the street you won't have any luck. They have excellent frozen yogurt. The flavors taste great and the consistency is creamy without being too "icy". There are a lot of toppings to choose from and they let you taste flavors before you buy. It is serve yourself. The service is excellent and friendly. I come here all the time because I work across the street. They have a punch card program and they give two punches on Tuesdays. On par with what you would expect pricewise.  I did stop by the other day and it looked like they were closed (during a weekday lunch hour) which was kind of odd. I am hoping they haven't closed down for good!~frozen yogurt. ~5
3vxNIpEg5SmmInek0b7ulQ~vS6ijI3GkRlGlpIbQQpfIw~Dear fro yo gods--thank you for finally planting yourself Uptown! My co-worker told me that she wanted some ice cream today and I promptly said "Hey, let's try The Frozen Isle, the new fro yo place" and couldn't have been happier. No longer do I have to go to Cold Stone or La Harris Teeter when I'm having a cold craving, I can just walk across the street to the Overstreet Mall!  Like some of my favorite fro yo places, you pay by the ounce so if you want something little, you can get a small portion or if you're having a bad day in corporate America, you can gorge! They have 10-12 different flavors ranging from fruity ones like strawberry, raspberry, pineapple to more decadent ones like french vanilla, banana cream, dark chocolate. The toppings rock as well--fresh fruit! None of that sugary fruit mix from a can that's swimming in syrup but fruit like blackberries, kiwi, blueberries and strawberries at their peak. And to top it all off-Ghirardelli syrups like caramel and chocolate plus they have punch cards that you can get punched for each visit, oh yeah!!  So I guess I need to add a "Frozen Isle" budget along to my coffee budget each week? I think I can swing that!~ice cream pineapple banana caramel coffee ~5
3vxNIpEg5SmmInek0b7ulQ~0fF_zHPVtKuZNL47Os1I7Q~I cant believe I'm saying this....not all frozen yogurt is the same...I normally grab some white chocolate mousse frozen yogurt from Frozen Isle but I wasnt in the area so I went to Yo Fruitty located in Ballantyne instead...I should've known something was amiss when I walked in and it smelled soury (is that a word) and the gentleman asked if i wanted a sample and I saw they had white chocolate mousse...he gave me a sample and although it looked more icey than creamy I gave it a try...ewwwww...suffice to say I left the store empty handed, with a nasty taste on my tonge and will never stray from Frozen Isle again (except maybe to get ice cream from Baskin-Robbins).~frozen yogurt white frozen yogurt white ice cream ~5
3vxNIpEg5SmmInek0b7ulQ~S2xmnV4lv9_GFO7OwPQPVQ~This is one of those "dang, why did I not think of this and get filthy rich" ideas!  The shop in Charlotte is the pilot store for TFI...I imagine it is only a matter of time before they franchise the heck out of this.  The "do-it-yourself" frozen yogurt concept is a great idea, on many levels.  First, being able to make your own allows you to customize to your liking...no "ummm-ing and ahhh-ing" over a menu board.  It saves time in the line too!  You don't like what you got?  Can't complain to management, because you did it to yourself!  The topping bar is filled with all the typical favorite candy and chocolate toppings, as well as freshy fruit and nuts, if you are inclined to the more healthy options.  I am not, and promptly turned my cup of yogurt into a trip to Willy Wonka's magical chocolate factory.  Which brings me to my next point...it is easy for someone like me to get carried away in a place like this.  What starts out as a tiny cup of ice cream can turn into an $8 hayday supermarket sweep once you hit the topping bar!  But, once again...you can't complain about the price, because pricing is by weight.  You don't like what you're paying?  Get less!  It is very dangerous to open up a place like this within walking distance of my office....maybe I should just go ahead and buy the stock in this company now.~frozen yogurt ice cream ~5
4pueeOSFah1oSst6NkFCGQ~pi7mZyRdwM7kb6pg2kecQA~Kitchen Stuff Plus is popping up all over the suburbs as of recently. This location of Kitchen Stuff Plus is fairly old.  I went into this store yesterday waiting for a friend to show up. I absolutely adore it. Upon walking in, within the first 3 minutes in the store, I was greeted not once, but twice by friendly employees there.  They are all friendly and eager to help (new perhaps? haha).    This store has some pretty unique items. You can find everything from mushroom brushes, dessert plates to lunch bags and toothbrush holders.  Speaking of lunchbags, I found these cool lunch bags, they looked kind of thermal, but with funky designs (soft shell) for $12! So cheap. I was tempted to buy one, then I realized, oh wait, I'm poor!  I was also tempted to buy some magnets, with designs like "download" and then a cartoon guy sitting on a toilet. hahaha, those were 3 for $8.  What a steal.   A place to go to find some really cheap plate sets and kitchen accessories!~mushroom ~4
4pueeOSFah1oSst6NkFCGQ~R1jyD4KZ8lUsry3qh0zW_w~I love this place. LOVE. Forget the overpriced kitchen-gadget stores on the Danforth. You will find the exact same stuff here for a fraction of the price.   I cannot go here without spending a small fortune. I always find so many useful items and gifts. Watching me shop here is probably frightening. I get far too excited and someone always needs to stop me before I start buying egg cups and yolk seperators with little cartoon chickens on them. If you've been to this store, you know exactly what I'm talking about.~egg ~4
4pueeOSFah1oSst6NkFCGQ~8m5ww90kiuAKNPZxbKYVJg~This place is fantastic - they have a huge selection of stuff - and not just for the kitchen.  When we moved back to Canada we agonized over whether to ship our kitchen stuff and finally decided not to and instead replace it once we got here. At first I thought we had made the wrong decisions (try opening a can with a swiss army blade, or grating cheese by slicing it very very very thinly - not so fun or fast) - but after visiting this store on 3 separate occasions I no longer doubted our choice.  Not only is it way more fun to shop for new kitchen things then unwrapping old stuff from a box, but everytime I go in I see some new gadget that I had never even heard of - a stick to pull hot things out of the oven - anyone?  So far I have been buying the basics (peelers, spatulas, drying rack cutting board, measuring cups and so on - the quality is excellent - they carry Oxo which i'm obsessed with) but once that has been completed I can't wait to move onto the more 'nice to have but not essential things' they carry.~swiss cheese ~4
1RKD5kqYzFcJGor2g6dBMw~gC_eBzzsO3uoP0DN-6aJ3g~Something must have changed since these other reviews were written, or else the others here are very high maintenance. Yes, some updates are needed and there was a notice in the lobby which pointed that was coming in June 2013. However, we had good wings and salad in the bar, wonderful and friendly service, HDTV with plenty of channels, re-tooled bathroom, old wall unit climate control, and older bed. For what it is, I submit this hotel was nice. It's all relative, you know? Listen, if you want top-notch in the 'Burgh you'll need to stay downtown and drop $300 per night. Got it? Everything was clean, everything worked, staff was knowledgeable and did their jobs, amenities WERE representative of a blue-collar old town 3/5 star airport area sleepery...I was pleased for the $140 out the door price (Monday night with a Steeler game in town). 4 stars on Yelp all the way! Give this place a try and then for sure we'll all be impressed come June '13.~salad ~4
1RKD5kqYzFcJGor2g6dBMw~-GX8O-lRkcS1tNhjFxfdTA~The staff is wonderful, and the service was great.  I especially liked the aromatherapy package that was in the room. It contained a foot and hand treatment and some body spritz.  The templespa company which made the products owes a debt to the hotel for advertising the products. I am a fan.  The hotel is under renovation, and at the moment is a little out of date. In no time, it will be fixed out, and you will love the setting as much as I loved the service.

When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  "Dane? Like the Great Dane?"  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie's and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek.    From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it's appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie's special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.    What was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie's surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I'm very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie's it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.    Wait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.    Some people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie's brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip.   Overall, go to Tootsie's with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times.~pork pork ranch dressing, salad ~5
29uk0fZJAWdSQhWhasYI9A~v9J-dZljH2jF6Dv5r93K-A~Perfect bar food, Strong drinks, friendly bartender. This is a quintessential dive bar atmosphere with a simple menu. Try the fries with bacon and cheese.  Really simple nice place to stop if you are coming through Dane.~fries bacon cheese. ~5
29uk0fZJAWdSQhWhasYI9A~Aw-yy9nvNd8FXfTO0lo2Qw~We stopped in for a drink and decided to have the nightly special. The special was the Tootsie's Bird special. This consisted of smoked turkey breast, smoked chicken drummies and smoked chicken leg and thigh. All served on Texas toast with side of smoked baked beans with chunks of bacon. DELICIOUS!!! everything was great and you cant beat the price.~chicken chicken bacon. ~5
-7weOHmN5s487aq-7zMbtw~AGf_RFCF_uGd9OaetcV6gg~For large events, Driftwood handled it well. knowledgeable and courtious staff and the food was GREAT!    We started with a delicious gazpacho instead of a salad, had the fish and short ribs. Delicious!    I'd also like to point out that their cocktail hour cheese plating buffet was spectacular.  Huge blocks of cheese, crackers, all very well displayed.  Plus, my favorite thing about it was that they left the cheese out all night and kept an eye on it, refilling as necessary.  I can't tell you how great it was to be munching on cheese all night!~gazpacho salad, ribs. cheese cheese, cheese cheese ~5
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~IDBVXiQp-XKNiPq6hQsuJw~The strolling musicians were pleasant. It was a beautiful, mild summer night and sitting on a terrasse sharing a fine Italian red wine with good friends was so lovely. That was the best thing about our evening.  Slow, understaffed service. The antipasti appetizer was good though missing some menu items  such as  the Giardiniera Di Lequmi.  Pastas were just passable and I couldn't eat more than half of my Calabrese pizza - it tasted like those frozen things I avoid.  Dessert & coffee were presented on the house - nice touch but  we won't return. We were among many patrons that had taken advantage of the coupon deal.  Don't bother - pass this one by.~pizza coffee ~1
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~7iJb__v9JLOhPXsMQ0JI9Q~My family of four had dinner tonight at Da Enrico.  It was fabulous.  Best food we have had in Montreal during our trip so far.  We each ordered something different and each meal was great.  The veal parmesan was really nice, and the homemade marinara sauce that they put on the pasta on the side was light and fresh and non-acidic.  The Rigatoni with tres formaggi was awesome as well.  The spaghetti with Carbonara sauce was actually light and flavorful, not too rich.  The chef didn't use cream with the sauce - just flash-cooked the egg and broth to create a creamy sauce.  The pizza was pretty good as well.  Bring your own bottle of wine, and have a great time.~pasta spaghetti carbonara egg pizza ~5
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~WDMZ47V2rRKG61y_eUrSoA~Worst Italian restaurant I have ever been to. The service was slow and the food was awful. The pasta tasted like clumps of salt, and it was extremely overcooked. The pizza tasted like cardboard. This is not authentic Italian food.~pasta pizza ~1
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~eAzC52LjMV2eZXpLZwNDjQ~This restaurant had the best food, service and atmosphere I found in my trip to Montreal. The restaurant was busy, but the waiter and owner still managed to give us all the attention we needed. The food was delicious - the waiter was nice enough (when we ordered a pizza) to tell us there was a $5 charge to split it, and encouraged us to order something else off the menu since we would be paying for it anyway. We got meatballs and they were awesome (but there were only two so don't order them unless you would otherwise be paying to split the bill - I think they were $7). There was a guy playing violin, which was fun. They only take cash and Interact though... no credit cards!~pizza meatballs ~5
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~qsvnig5OI_AvFLk998xxFw~I went for food here for dinner with a group of friends and was not too impressed by the service or the food. The decor gave me the feeling that the restaurant was authentic or family run, both of which are probably true. The shepherds cross table cloths and the disco music was the highlight of the place, but it could use a coat of paint. The kitchen is open air, but the ventilation is poor. The price point does not reflect quality or presentation. The server was slow to check in about water, wine and constantly tried to up-sell us on appetizers and desserts. On the plus side, they bring you bread and it is a BYOB resto.~appetizers desserts. ~3
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~8Je5uD9C9WODq5LHVeaIxA~This place is sooo Italian. Italian music, Italian paraphernalia all over the walls, Italian staff...   Very casual and relaxed atmosphere.  We ordered a couple of pasta dishes, ravioli and spaghetti and they were both good. The portions are fair in size and are presented in cool frying pans - neat idea!.  Service was fast - we got our food right away and when we needed more bread, they brought it to our table in no time.  Casual, simple and good, can't go wrong when you're looking to get a quick pasta fix :)  Cash and debit only - no credit cards.~pasta spaghetti pasta ~3

KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~b-G8GTWPolaQt9R6ol4JNA~avant c'était nice, maintenant c'est Mauvais On arrive la bas avec l'intention d'utiliser un vieux coupon Resto boom qui devrait en theorie garder sa valeur nominale apres la date ou le deal est terminé. On constate que le menu est rendu vraiment poche et plus cher qu'avant mais bon, l'inflation fait son travail et certains restos deviennent plus mediocre plutot que de tenter de s'améliorer... qu'est ce que tu veux? On commande et je mentionne tout de suite au serveur que je vais utiliser ce bon. Il me dit que non ca fonctionne pas car expiré...Je lui dit de regarder plus bas c'est inscrit : "après sa date d'expiration, le coupon est encore valide pour la valeur de l'achat" Il me dit : "ben non ca marche pas car resto boom voudront pas me payer" en passant, le coupon est d'une valeur de 15$.... pas 50$ ( me semble que pour 15$ tu ne fais pas d'histoire si tu es un restaurateur intelligent) en plus, il se met à raconter notre cas a tous le monde dans le resto... juste pour que tout le monde parle juste de ca super fort pour qu'on ait l'air super cheap. Ok je lui dit de pas faire d'histoire avec ca et que je ferai une plainte a Resto boom, il me dit : "ecoute je le connais le gars de Resto boom, c'est mon ami!" Il me semble que si il le connait, il a rien qu'a accepter le coupon et arreter de me faire sentir idiot avec mon coupon expiré.   bon ok, je parle a mon épouse et lui demande qu'est ce qu'on fait, on décide de partir... Ils nous envoie chier literalement quand on passe la porte...  je sais pas mais nous on est resté ben poli dans tout ca ;-)  on a été juste pas loin a pizza Napolitana où eux autres connaissent les bonnes manieres... ;-) et leur pizza est fantastique  Dont go a Da Enrico #crosseurs, #impolis ,~date date pizza pizza ~1
KX6dfWkYsmguaxJLEwLHLA~--x0kZzV0IFto5q79baf6w~Outre le bouffe (moyenne), le décor cheesy, et le service un peu rude, le problème du Da Enrico c'est la FRAUDE. Je m'explique. Hier, je commande deux lasagnes avec ma copine. Le menu est très simple, il y a environ 10 plats. Les lasagne sont à 15,95$ Après le repas, quand vient le temps de payer, je constate que les lasagne sont facturées 18,95$ chacune!! Quand je fais remarquer cela à Tony, il me dit que c'est son erreur. Or, la facture, qu'il ne m'a pas remise, indique bien 18,95$ Il faut comprendre qu'à ce prix s'ajoutent les taxes (calculées sur 18 95) et le pourboire, 15% de 18,95. Malgré mes explications, on m'a remis 7 dollars, soit bien moins que la surcharge, quand on tient compte des taxes et du pourboire.  Bref,chez Da Enrico, on n'hésite pas à vous frauder en plein visage, avec le sourire. Chez Da Enrico, on vous prend pour un imbécile et on vous fraude.  Plus jamais on ne m'y reprendra, ni aucun de mes amis.~lasagne lasagne ~1

The top place for soccer (Futebol/European Football) clothing and wearables in Montreal and one of the best shops in a canada for Football jerseys and items. The main floor has a strong selection of National shirts, warm up jackets and pants plus Montreal Impact gear. Price of many of these items is high for authentic merchandise. If you want fake jerseys order online. Quality however is night and day different with the real deal. Upstairs is one of the largest selections of shoes/boots/cleats for field play or Indoors. If you okay or are just a huge fan of the sport then this is your place. They also have a decent website evangelistasports.com if you want to check out items before visiting.   I'll always keep this place in mind for items for myself or other huge footy fans.~sport ~4
6pqs4pa-zUbLJ2vPKCiDOw~W45cTKTf53UVBDz1N2oXeQ~Nice new shiny Starbucks that replaced a sub-par Italian bakery on the Dufferin side of Corso D'Italia on St Clair. Is it a sure sign of gentrification to come? Probably. Considering all the mom and pop shops in the area seem to be selling out and they are putting a shoppers drugmart across the street. Hopefully they don't bulldoze all the old Portuguese and Italian character of this hood that make it unique.   All that being said, its a Starbucks. Love it or hate it, its got all kind of sugary drinks masqueradeing as coffee. Its also pretty standard so no matter what location you are at, the coffee is always the same. I have to admit I'm partial to the Vanilla Bean latte but don't really like the coffee at all.~coffee. coffee coffee ~4
9iHmgsWwhCb__SLkDhMeOQ~SLx5PdxZcqXvuItIpY1qwg~This outlet is a bit of a random find in the good old St James Centre, which is not exactly a shining beacon of shopping centre beauty, but it has plenty of shops and covers you for most conventional things you might need.  Anyway, back to the shop I'm actually reviewing, Republic stocks both male and female clothing, including girly, fashionable make Miso, plus a range of more casual, sporty gear. I've recently found it to be a major threat to my bank account, disguised as an innocent shop with items of clothing at reasonable to cheap prices. One wee, cheap, reasonable thing leads to another, so when I'm here, I usually end up thinking I'm being well behaved by buying a pretty dress at only £20, but then I see a nice top beckoning me over, and then I can't stop, and I'm at the till and the shop assistant is stuffing bags full of garments....then it's all over so quickly, and I'm out of the shop, and it's like nothing ever happened. This shop is evil, but amazing for my impulse buying needs.~miso, ~4
9iHmgsWwhCb__SLkDhMeOQ~ea_E-Ejy5gTeO6_X31MsLA~Whenever I'm looking for a new outfit for a night out my first port of call is always Topshop or River Island and I often completely forget about Republic and I'm not sure why as they usually have some really nice items that are reasonably priced.  A few months ago in the Glasgow branch I saw a gorgeous black dress with white lace down the front, they didn't have my size but the girl was helpful and wrote down the code for me so I could try other Republics. I called another Glasgow branch but the girl wasn't very helpful and even though they had my size she told me that they don't have a policy of putting things aside so by the time I went in my size was sold out again. After that, I got bored of trying to hunt down the dress and let it slip to the back of my mind but whenever I had a night out I wished it was in my wardrobe. Last week I was in this branch of Republic and saw the dress again, I was so surprised that it was still in stock and they had my size and it had £5 off! I couldn't believe it... I guess it was meant to be and I'm super happy I finally have my paws on the dress!  The staff in this branch are friendly, they have a good range of stock both for guys and girls, everything is very reasonably priced and they often have good sales on too!~white ~4

( i know. i'm a monster) but if you go there on an off night it's a really nice place to go to with a date followed up with of course their black and white picture booth so you can remember the night forever. :) isn't that romantic?~date white ~4
FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w~l4S9zWunZLHC2j5_YPg3gg~Ah, what can I say? I fell in love with chez nous the minute I walked in the door (well, maybe five minutes after: I had to wait for my eyes to adjust from the blazing summer sun to the barely lit interior of this retro saloon).  Everything - and I mean everything is just how I remembered: The long bar; the line of cushioned booths along the wall; the wall of rock water feature behind the bar; the only light provided by super dim wall fixtures reminiscent of the late 19th century; the vintage velour wallpaper (now sans the yellowing and 45+ years of old cigarette smoke); the 70s soundtrack- it was all here!   We determined it was slightly smaller than the OG location, but setup almost identically, save for a certainly separate entry room - which, p.s. contained an ATM (this bar is cash only) AND an old school black-and-white photo booth ( a real one, that gives you actual photo-paper print outs).   There was a live band on *Wednesday* night - and they weren't half bad. They won my heart by opening with an instrumental cover of Ms. Jackson (if you're nasty)'s That's The Way Love Goes. Wonderful. Sadly, the special was $3 shots of purple hooter and some other shot I can't recall because i instantly began musing on my other options as soon as I heard "hooter" (it's a weeknight, for chrissakes - what am i? 22?). I believe thurs is 2-for-1 ladies night, too bad we missed that. So, me and the G settled for our mutual love of (well) G&Ts for $4 a pop. I believe draft beers were $3.50, imports $5 and top shelf up to $8.  But we stuck to the G&T, which our barmaid was kind enough to pack a helluva punch in. just three and I was already planning my ipod song list for the ride home (not alarmingly in and of itself, but my chosen songs were a tell-tale sign of drunkenness: lionel Richie/all night long; Britney spears/Gimme More; ToTo/Africa...you get the idea). she was also kind enough to come out to our table when she noticed we were getting low to replenish our liquids.  All in all this place, including its new location, are A+++ in my book.~white ~5
FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w~qFlu_fxI_-Bdd8d3cSaptg~Dear person who decided that we would have our "after party" at Chez Nous,  It is with the most utmost regret that inform you that you're choice of after party venues was teh suck. And no, I did not misspell "the". That's how we say it these days. Get with the times, sucka.  But seriously, wtf?  Through what twisted logic did you come to the conclusion that the best way to top off a birthday party at fez laden with free appetizers, cake, and drink specials was an over-priced, overcrowded jazz bar...on a Saturday night?  Now before I go any further, I shall confess to you that I was spared the $7 dollar charge. My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.  In either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos.   Unlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received. Because I didn't receive any. No, menacing glares and bathroom gossip was my lot. Feeling that my safety was in jeopardy, I was compelled to make a hasty exit in the middle of the chorus of "Ladies Night".   I'm not going to fault you for inviting me to a totally UN-safe space (because maybe I should've done some research before I took you up on it), but if you were a vegan I wouldn't invite you to a place that I knew had no vegan-friendly options. I'm going to leave it at that.  And I'm not going to expect you to ask all of us our age, but please be aware that there are a great number of us who were NOT products of the 70's and have little use for disco and gold chains.   The average patron had to be at least 10 years older and 20 years more behind on fashion than even you'd ever tolerate in a date. I take solace in the knowledge that you were just as unlucky as I would be (if I was single and into cougars, that is).  I know that the overall cost of Chez Nous might seem a little exaggerated, considering we just had free appetizers and cake at FEZ, but nothing ruins a birthday party afterglow like inane ATM fees and greedy, smooth-talking doormen.  Regardless, I want you to know that despite my displeasure with your recent choice of after-party locales, I still love you.   In fact, I'm grateful to you, in my own way. It's so hard to be funny and snarky when you're writing a 4-5 star review of a place. In a time where my ability to nitpick and rant, it's refreshing to finally find a place so terrible I am justified in my neurosis.   In the event that all of this is too wordy and convoluted to understand, I've made you a chart.   =Things That Are Awesome=  Yelp Martinis Zombie movies Lesbians  =Things That Are Not Awesome=  Overcrowded bars with unreasonable cover charge  See you at the next UYE, you jive motherfucker!  Hugs and kisses, Jetta  P.S. Nathan, I still have your coat. Let's make arrangements to get it back to you. The longer I have it the longer I'm going to be tempted to use it the next time Misty S and I have "roleplay night".   Which I might do anyway if I find out all this was your idea : - )~appetizers, cake, pizza sandwich date. appetizers cake ~1
FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w~_QQK2jIZsqmjU4BV5GpcaQ~I would contend to you, dearest Yelper, that I date attractive women. Or at least they're attractive to me. That's the important part, right?   But that doesn't mean that when I go out with them I always want to be able to see them... or worse yet have them see what I'm doing... And who knows what I'm doing when I'm there because I can't see the hand in front of my face. LOVE that...   The music always gets me grooving in my chair and I'm going to say something politically incorrect. I always feel cooler when I'm hanging out with African Americans. They just give off a cooler than cool vibe. I keep inviting my Afro-American roommate out to whatever and he's always like "Naahh Dude, you're too white." I get it. But I'll break him down eventually. Little does he know I'm Mongolian.   So anyway, it's a little difficult to order a drink and always crowded but overall I love it. Bring your stuck up yuppie friends. Smack their skinny asses with the iron hand of culture. They'll thank you tomorrow.~date white. ~5
FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w~a0epNtWYUvGzo5xn0Yy3ww~Chez Nous, I want to write you a love song...  ...a love song which describes how I had completely underestimated how much I missed you until I set foot inside your premises after 6 long months apart. Months that felt like years. But the moment I set foot in that door I immediately felt like I was home. My shoulders relaxed. My breathing eased up. I felt like my soul just got a massage.   ....a love song which describes my complete amazement upon walking inside on how much of the old you is still there with the new you. Wallpaper? Check. Lounge seats? Check. Wall fixtures? Lamps? Disco ball? Dancefloor? Low lights (and I mean LOW lights)? Cheap tinsel lining the ceiling? Check x 6. So now the bar is on the left instead of the right, but I don't mind. You're obviously still you, and that's all that matters.  ...a love song about the fact that the crowd inside tonight was just like the crowd inside the old you every night. Black, white, brown, yellow, green. It didn't matter then what color you were, and it sure as hell doesn't matter now. Everyone is chill. Everyone is relaxed. Everyone is cool. No airs. No pretense. No scene. Even the huge guy wearing the white full-length fur coat with matching white fur hat and white patent leather shoes and bling on every finger. Coolest, chillest guy in the room - just enjoying himself and having a great time and friendly to everyone.   ...a love song which exemplifies the glories of the drinks and the service. Drinks? Still dirt cheap. Service? Still completely & genuinely friendly. Never once makes you feel like for some reason you're not cool enough to belong there.  ...a love song which shows my great appreciation for the music. The funk and R&B is back, people. "Let's Stay Together", your perennial classic, followed by "You Dropped A Bomb On Me", followed by "Word Up", followed by "Don't Stop Till You Get Enough," followed by...."Jailhouse Rock?!?" Yes, it did happen. And tonight, you did the impossible. You made me get up. And then you made me get down. Down on the dancefloor. That's right. Me doing my own brand of jive. For the first time since I've been in Arizona. 2 years, and it came down to being in the new you to compel me to bust out some moves. Now I wouldn't say I have mad skillz with the way I move. Might be reminiscent of the African Anteater Ritual. But who cares? You never did.  ...and last but not least...  ...a love song about how you actually came back to me. And to everyone else who loved you. How you simply didn't just throw your hands up in the air and call it quits. How you persisted and moved forward. How volunteers toiled day and night moving as much from your old location to the new one to make everyone feel comfortable from the moment they walked in. How you have truly pulled a Phoenix and have risen from the ashes. How I'll admit that driving by the empty lot on 7th Ave and Indian School was a depressing experience, but no more.   Because you're back.  Because you're one of my favorite spots. Anywhere.  Because I hope you never have to go away again.   Because whatever your detractors say, you truly are a Phoenix legend.  That, Chez Nous, would be the love song I would write for you.~white, brown, white white white ~5

FbmeJQ3-fP_BozmNPLfx1w~rnu_xJLyXyW5zprMETz1vg~I love Chez Nous for the dancing, the live music is always great, but this past Friday I was really disappointed.  The cover charge has been raised to $7, the drinks were weak, and I got charged $9 for a Three Olives and Coke.  Combine that with being cash only so getting hit for $3 at the ATM inside the bar, and after one poor drink I was already at $20.  Maybe it's because I've gone back to being a broke college student, but I found the whole experience disappointing.  It seems like a few articles in the AZ Republic recently and the prices are flying through the roof.  So for now, I think I'm going to take a break from our relationship... sorry Chez Nous~coke. ~2
5sphAhVL85z6QW4dCjwCUg~ahNb01_S8mPuRq3PNb7Cog~Wenn ich gleich eingangs zugebe, daß ich Hotelrestaurants eigentlich nicht mag (zuviele Erinnerungen an Seminare mit gefüllter Hähnchenbrust mit Broccoli aus der Kategorie "chicken or pasta?" und trostlose Abendessen auf Reisen), dann muß ich mir natürlich die Frage gefallen lassen, was mich ins Restaurant Weissenhof im Arcotel Camino treibt. Tja, was soll ich sagen - auf Stuttgarts architektonischer Gruselmeile namens Heilbronner Straße fiel mir irgendwann das Altbauensemble positiv auf, und das Design des Eingangs wirkte ansprechend. Und es waren auch nirgends verwertbare Kritiken zu finden... Und so fanden wir uns heute im Weissenhof wieder, nachdem der Tafelberg keinen Platz für uns hatte.   Bei der telefonischen Reservierung bat ich um einen schönen Tisch und wurde gleich gefragt, ob es ein besonderer Anlaß sei - meine Antwort war nein, wir hätten nur gerne was am Fenster oder am Rand und nicht direkt im Getümmel. Wurde vermerkt und auch erfüllt, wäre angesichts der sehr übersichtlichen Besetzung an einem Freitagabend nicht wirklich nötig gewesen.   Der Eingang zum Restaurant ist identisch mit Hotel und Bar, man steigt außen die Stufen hoch und wird hinter den Türen gleich von einem riesigen Kronleuchter begrüßt, der - zumindest heute abend - pink angestrahlt war. Hinter dem Kronleuchter ging eine Innentreppe gleich weiter in den Hotelbereich, rechts und links von dieser landete man an der Bar mit ledergepolsterten Bänken und dunkelbraunen Tischen zu beiden Seiten, rechts biegt man ins Restaurant ab. Die Farbstellung ist creme-braun, laut Karte zitiert man - Überraschung - die Weissenhofsiedlung, deshalb auch der eher gewöhnungsbedürftige braun-beige gemusterte Teppich im Restaurant, das farblich ebenfalls in cremefarbenen Leder und dunklem Holz gehalten war. Ja, und da geht's schon los, warum haben Hotelrestaurants immer Teppichboden? Und gruselige abgehängte Decken? Und eine Beleuchtung, wie sie kein normales Restaurant installieren würde? Fragen über Fragen, unfair, weil ja, wir sind im Hotel.   Der bei weitem angenehmste Teil des Hotel-Seins war der Service. Der war umwerfend, freundlich, souverän, unaufdringlich, eine gelungene Interaktion mit dem Gast, weder servil noch desinteressiert. Könnte ich dafür sechs Sterne geben, jederzeit sofort. Also ganz, ganz großes Kompliment! Und wirklich schöne Überraschung war die Aperitiv-Empfehlung Trollinger brut, ein außerordentlicher Schaumwein, der mit meinem Trollinger-Alptraum von der IHK absolut nichts gemeinsam hat. Mit € 5,90 für 0,1 l aber auch sehr anspruchsvoll in der Preislage. Brot kam zügig, nicht schlecht, aber es fehlte an Knusprigkeit. Die Butter dazu war eiskalt, keine ideale Kombination. Verwunderlicherweise kein Gruß aus der Küche, hätte ich bei einem Restaurant mit diesem Anspruch eigentlich erwartet.   Die Karte ist eher klein, man wirbt mit Schwäbisch / Österreichisch (österreichisch das Menü, die Fleischgerichte und ein paar Nachspeisen), zwischendurch einige Einsprengsel nicht ganz eindeutiger Provenienz zwischen Crossover und Büffelmozzarella. Eine Handvoll Vorspeisen (Carpaccio von der Maultasche, Beef Tartar), zwei Suppen, dreimal Fisch (gedämpfter Viktoriabarsch, Zander mit Paprikapolenta), zweimal Vegetarisch (Erdäpfel-Schwammerl-Gulasch, Topfen/Kraut), vier oder fünf Fleischgerichte (Tafelspitz, Kalbsrahmgulasch), ebensoviele Desserts. Wirklich sehr gute Weinauswahl mit Schwerpunkt Ba-Wü und Ö, ungewöhnlich, exzellent und - pardon - schweineteuer. 1/8 Weiß vom exklusiveren Teil der Karte war bei € 6,20 bis 7,90, zugegeben, die Weine waren außergewöhnlich mit Empfehlung auf den Weingütern Currle und Hager (die günstigeren fingen bei  € 2,90 das Achtel an, aber wir waren probierwütig), aber bei € 6,60 für 0,75 l Vösslauer Mineralwasser medium würde ich mich sehr gerne mal mit dem Controller unterhalten.   Mein Mann nahm das österreichische Menü mit schwäbischem Einschlag, erst Flädlesuppe (nein, nicht Frittatensuppe, Frittaten seien knuspriger als Flädle, hieß es), dann Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffelsalat, etwas Feldsalat und Preißelbeeren, zum Schluß Kaiserschmarrn mit Zwetschgenkompott und Apfelmus. Ich war konzeptlos und nahm den Papayasalat mit Thunfisch (drei Würfel Thunfisch, einmal mit Petersilie, einmal kroß natur, einmal mit Leinsamen, alle drei innen noch roh, tolle Qualität), das Dressing sehr neutral bis geschmacksarm, einzig belebt von ein paar Blättchen Thai-Basilikum. Die gute Produktqualität ließ die fehlende Originalität verzeihen. Flädlesuppe war eher auf der salzigen Seite und laut meiner besseren Hälfte nichts besonderes.   Danach die organisatorische Herausforderung, ich hatte die Kukuruzsuppe und anschließend den ganzen Saibling mit Petersilienkartoffeln bestellt, mein Mann eben Hauptgang und Dessert, die salomonische Lösung war, mir die Suppe separat zu bringen, fand ich auch besser als wenn der Saiblingduft zum Kaiserschmarrn rüberzieht. Und die Suppe war das absolute Highlight des Abends, e...~broccoli chicken pasta? butter beef desserts. thai- ~4
5sphAhVL85z6QW4dCjwCUg~skgeN46F58Mze-X3zKJJjQ~Das Restaurant Weißenhof kann ich nicht empfehlen.  Die Atmosphäre des Restaurants: Eine lange, düstere Halle mit beigefarbenem Kunstledermobiliar. Ein beigebraungrün gemusterter Teppichboden - auf dem man Flecken garantiert nicht sieht. Eine Decke wie im Kaufhaus: Gipsplatten mit Löchern und diversen Abzugs- bzw. Lüftungsschächten.  Da wir ein Candlelightdinner hatten (Geschenk) gabs eine Kerze und ein paar künstliche Rosenblätter plus zwei Dekosteinen auf den Tisch. Die Vorspeise war gut: Kalte Kalbfleischröllchen mit Friseesalat, vom angekündigten Kürbiskernöl war weder etwas zu sehen noch zu schmecken.  Es folgte eine Spinatcremesuppe: Wenn ich sie mit geschlossenen Augen gegessen hätte, hätte ich den Spinat nicht geschmeckt. Viel Sahne und Würzmittel eben.  Anschließend hatte ich Teigtaschen mit Steinpilzfüllung (15 Euro), für die dasselbe gilt: Ich habe absolut keinen Pilz, schon gar keinen Steinpilz herausschmecken können. Da sie schmeckten wie in einer schlechten Kantine, fragte ich die Bedienung, ob diese Pasta im eigenen Haus angefertigt worden sei. Sie sagte ganz schnell "Ja" und verschwand sofort wieder. Wobei ich sagen muss, dass die Bedienung mit ihrer Freundlichkeit und ihrer Aufmerksamkeit der einzige Glanzpunkt in diesem Restaurant war. Meine Begleitung hatte einen schwäbischen Rostbraten (19 Euro). das Fleisch war gut. Die Spätzle waren sehr dick und schwammen in einer total überfetteten Soße.  Danach gab es als Dessert noch ein Bananensorbet. Zwei dicke graue Scheiben mit einem sehr kristallinen Eis, gut waren nur die Spuren der Schokoladensoße daneben. Last but not least:  Die Toiletten waren sehr sauber und angenehm. Aber das kann ja nicht der Grund sein, ein Restaurant zu besuchen ...~pasta ~1

Nun habe ich in Ludwigsburg noch nicht viele Pizzas gegessen, aber eines kann ich sagen: die anderen PizzabäckerInnen müssen sich gewaltig anstrengen, wenn sie Antonio übertreffen wollen. Knuspriger Teig, außerdem guter und würziger Belag. Übrigens kann man hinter dem typischen Pizza-Service-Eingangsbereich auch im Lokal selbst ganz gemütlich die Speisen verzehren - es werden dort auch offene Weine ausgeschenkt. Unbedingt probieren!~pizza pizza ~5

3QxRg8v2Uej_--8DyO3maQ~d-DS-PBfJ7aBGXB9oJ-p3g~I felt like a criminal walking into this place.  I think kindergarten had less rules than The Pink Poodle.  First you can't carry in a larger handbags.  Must keep them in your car.  That makes a girl feel welcome in your store for sure!  "Welcome to Pink Poodle, now please leave and put your purse in your car."  No chewing gum.  Only one person in the fitting room at a time.  They follow you around the store.    One of my friends bought a $700 Chanel handbag and they still were rude to her!  Way too high priced for what they had to offer there.  A snooty, holier than thou vibe is definitely the vibe you get after shopping there.  I made every attempt to not spend any money there and believe me, it wasn't hard not to.    I brought in a purse to possibly have as a consignment piece there and they said they only do consignment two days a week and they only except it till 5:00pm.  So basically if you want to sell something there you are screwed if you work like the majority of the world does.  All in all not impressed.  The place felt super toxic and it's clear to me my experience mirrored many others.  Let's see how long this business will last!~chewing gum. ~1

It's really well located near a trendy Montreal area and once you finish eating, you can go hang out at some of the bars, movie theater, or other awesome places around there.~beef ~5

Decor is clean, with interesting paintings in the rear where we sat, and bamboo placemats for our dishes. The place is a decent size, with front seating facing Saint Denis.  We stopped in randomly for lunch. It was past the lunch rush, so there were only a handful of diners. Ordered the nid au poulet (C$9.95), which was grilled chicken and vegetables sauteed on fried noodles (think bird's nest) - the chicken was great. The sushi I tried was average, and my friends agreed. (They have a "pizza sushi" roll that looked interesting - anyone game?)  We didn't leave hungry; if I lived in the area, I'd probably return for take-out. Service was fine, but I don't need to sit to enjoy their food.~chicken chicken sushi pizza sushi" ~3
83irQ3M7l0DeQr0PBAJt4A~jitpzUhUm8zb86mpkcL22g~This place was great.  We sat on the terrace and had an amazing meal.  I had a seafood Thai lemongrass soup that had such the right amount of spice.  My meal was a fish meal that was super yummy, everyone else had soup and sushi and it all looked awesome.  Service was great, and they did not make too much fun of my horrible French while ordering, LOL.  Decor was sooo adorable, all pink chairs on the inside of the restaurant.  Loved this place.~thai lemongrass soup soup sushi ~5

The bill was not ok though, 60$ for what I ate looked like too much. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone but I wouldn't say it's awful either~mango shrimp salad chicken ~3
1-rUjW65plaAjIMVMJjP_Q~lTqK_L2F-6E9o-6HlU73kQ~This was a charming little inn. Our room was actually pretty huge. We could open windows partially to let fresh air in (huge in hotels these days!). There was also a huge bathroom with a shower that could easily fit four people. In addition to the huge CA king sized bed, they fit  a few chairs in the room for lounging. So much room for just two of us!  The decor may be a bit old fashioned for some people, but it really was quite charming. There was also a continental breakfast the next morning which we missed, but which I assume was fabulous due to proximity to Gamekeepers.   If you happen to go to Gamekeepers for dinner, it's about 5 steps away from the hotel. Our room even looked out to the Gamekeepers patio.  A wonderful time. Although perhaps I'm biased. They left the most wonderful cookies for us on our pillows. :)~cookies ~4

Bed is huge and comfy :)) The place is haunted though for sure, while we were sleeping two different lights in the bathroom kept turning on (as in the switch flipped ) we asked the next morning and the owners said that a few other guests have mentioned weird occurrences and the night auditor had seen strange things happen , room thirteen seems to be the place where it happens the most .~cookies ~4
3waPXnRWtxjk9s9-9y0Z6w~sOrfWqFibH4hBMRdV4APuQ~With a £7 apple martini tasting like watery gin pretty much the poorest cocktail bar I've ever been in. It was literally undrinkable and after admitting there was no fresh fruit or juice available to make the cocktails, staff reluctantly swapped it for something drinkable, but seemed to htin kthey were doing me a favour! Avoid at all costs!~apple ~1
3waPXnRWtxjk9s9-9y0Z6w~2XviJH7LPHVPUdTd1VZCsg~This place is pretty local to us so we sometimes have sunday brunch (survivor's breakfast) here. That seems like the best time for it.    The best thing about the place are the interiors (of the front bistro anyway), its a comfy little place to have a bit of food, a coffee or hair-of-the-dog. The food is fairly standard, for breakfast/lunch but disappointing for dinner and the restaurant in the back is dark with awkward seating. The service can be slow at best, on occasion the staff can get your order completely right but the odds are slim.    They used to have sunday lunchtime live piano music which made it a place to return to but the last couple of times had the staff let loose on iPod. Lets hope it goes back to older, better habits.~coffee ~2
3waPXnRWtxjk9s9-9y0Z6w~pv0rVtv1Mq5TYA6q2_tG_A~I haven't ever checked out the hotel but I can speak about the experience I had in the Restaurant about 7 months ago.  I was feeling particularly swanky when reading the menu, so I ordered the surf and turf lobster. Lobster is one of those funny dishes that are really simple to cook, but insanely hard to get right. Thank god the chef in here is a part time wizard.  The portion itself was huge, it looked like a mythical sea beast on my plate. The taste? Wonderful, the meat was tender, full of flavor and I'm sure it was caught that day. The best part was the price, coming in at just under £17 for my half of the bill including a pint.~surf and turf ~5

A modern, new and excellently designed bar houses comfy booths, lounge areas and tables - often taken up by regulars loyal to the friendly and relaxed atmosphere in the Borough.  Drinks are moderately priced, but the vast range of spirits and draughts are excellently served by friendly staff. Cocktails however, are the bars speciality - a huge menu  of classics and modern drinks for you to choose from is available.  The Borough Hotel restaurant is also a modern and well designed area, with food ranging from burgers and chips to fine dining. While the restaurant is more pricey than the bar in comparison, food is outstanding and there is often a deal on to lessen the bill.  The Borough Bar also provides a free pub quiz on a Monday evening, as well as a poker night every Tuesday and even salsa classes if you phone for details.  The Borough bar and restaurant is a modern place for a friendly drink with friends or a quiet meal.~burgers chips salsa ~4

0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~YVTh64H2RhVE1tOvvVUmjQ~Looks like I'm on a roll with getting horrible service at what are usually pretty decent restaurants lately!  I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!  Carter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')    The next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.  So, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.  So, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.  Bottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!~chicken salmon. tacos? chicken fajitas? chips salsa... chips salsa, fajitas chicken fajitas ~2
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~fbr9MLZCWqDn3EWJWBm3iA~My recent , but admittedly brief, experience was terrific! The service was fast and friendly, the price was good, and the food was really, really good.   A friend and I stopped for a brief appetizer and margarita before heading to the Lyle Lovett concert. Margaritas for $3.00 until 7 PM...YUM! I loved the chips and salsa. The chips are a mixed style and the salsa had an unusual, homemade flavor. We shared an order of chicken nachos and OMG...were they good. Whatever creamy sauce was added was a wonderful addition.   The atmosphere was nice and open; the more modern Southwest style was a refreshing change. And like I said above, the service was friendly and quick.~chips salsa. chips salsa chicken nachos ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~LFeyML9NWrBJms_LrClL7g~Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage.~waffle chicken chicken ~1
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~F1QheWHmBNg117l1KBdgUQ~What a pleasant surprise! I went here for a friends birthday dinner and were greeted with a friendly smile and "hello."  Chips and salsa lined the table and were a mix or corn and blue corn, and i think some of them had been rolled in cinnamon and pepper. I had to force myself to stop eating them.  A friend and I ordered chicken fajitas and we wanted to split the entree and the server brought us out two plates with the guac., sour cream, etc on both plates. That was nice. The beans and rice were delicious, the server had a pleasant attitude (and I could tell she had a lot going on) and she kept my water full.  She brought out a dessert tray and told us about each item. THEN after she brought the check she came back with little white chocolate tamales for everyone! (White chocolate in a corn husk.) Holy cow! How awesome is that!~chips salsa corn corn, chicken fajitas sour cream, white tamales white corn ~5
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~jDs2SnQ0cD059Hec3PW1VA~Supposedly this place was going to close down beacuse of the new condos going in. Thankfully they got an extension on their lease.  The condos aren't going in just yet.  The food here is consistently good.  The service was average. I really like the Sonoran meatloaf. It's a great location and you'll have a good meal here. The menu is pseudo tex-mex.  It's a good place to go on a date, an office lunch, take family, or out of towners over the age of 40.  Not a drinking place...at all.  I would not recommend the place for large groups or meeting friends.  It doesn't have that kind of vibe.~meatloaf. date, ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~EUUx_zAf3Cj3We-ir0GTpA~I like how they do things at Sam's. It's upstairs in the Biltmore Mall but they manage to be the most laid back of all the bar/restaurants in the area. They convincingly do mexican food in a southwestern style with all sorts of interesting twists and spins on dishes that I haven't seen before. The chicken enchiladas are dee-lish and the margaritas are some of the best I've had.   Service is touch and go when they're busy but for the most part I've always been content with their staff. It's a pretty good date spot and the prices are reasonable, especially considering the caliber of the food they serve.~chicken date ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~Hn0g7spAdq6mar4rkCN6tA~Seafood Fajitas... very good....  they also have one of my favortie Pinot Noir's La Crema!  they used to have this great little southwesten... Chocolate thing they gave you after the meall ... so missed that...~fajitas... ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~KHKTHVLNzLQtSqCFrqn5Dg~Okay, so i had a friend in from CO and she wanted Southwestern cuisine so I suggested Sam's even though I hadn't been there in 10 years.  First they serve you with their version of chips and salsa and I don't think I will ever settle for regular chips and salsa ever again after this. There were 4 different chips..2 had various spices, one had the taste of powdered sugar and the last were sweet potato. Each combined with the salsa was a bite of culinary delight. I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and was satisfied with my selection. However my friend ordered the black and blue quesadilla and it was beyond fantastic! Defintiely recommend even if just for cocktails and their chips. Oh I almost forgot.. you get a stick of white chocolate wrapped in a husk with your check! So either way you WILL be having dessert. ;)~chips salsa chips salsa chips.. sweet potato ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~cVvtGtft821K4COzOZPq3g~Really nice tex-mex.  Inside looked very nice, and I'm sure the natives flock to the AC, but as tourists, of course, we sat outside.  Remarkable homemade chips, some corn, some sweet potato, some something else, all very good.  Salsa was a bit on the tomatoe side for my taste, but good nonetheless.  The approach is a bit off-putting since it's upstairs fo a mall, but once inside it's just classy tex-mex and a step above avegare at that.~chips, corn, sweet potato ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~6KO6uGDySxI_VugWdNYOcw~Ok...so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix, I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table, the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part.  Every time I have been to this place they have never been that busy, but I will say there service is lacking, it seems that when ever I go there I get the dyslexic high school waiter who can't remember to bring me my refills I ask for or I get the recovering meth addict that hates life.  I usually end up getting the mushroom and spinach casadia which never disappoints, I like this places ambiance, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service always seems to blow.~chips salsa mushroom spinach ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~NegVOf09Lvefbv7_F_6K2A~Used to come here as a kid and had to visit again to see if it was still as good.  Seems like they've replaced the famous breadsticks with chips/salsa- but I'm not complaining- the chips were really yummy- sort of a sweet taste to them.  Wine selection was decent, waiter was a sweet heart too- he let us know pets are welcome to join you on the patio too- something about "Paws on the Patio", so if you're an animal lover it's a great place to bring the puppy.  Reminded me of the smaller sidewalk places off the pier in South Bay where everyone always brought their dogs.  As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do, word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there!  :)  Looking forward to going again- this time for margaritas!~chips steak ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~lVhUOr3-nt9AA2TaCGYNqg~I would love to give this place more than 3 stars but I had problems with the service. It took forever just to take our drink order. After he took our meal order he came back 15 minutes later because he had lost our ticket and couldn't remember what we had ordered. Then when we finally got our food, it was wrong. So had to send it back. On the good side of things, the salsa and chips were really good. The chips were a mixture of many different kinds which made it interesting. I had the seared ahi tuna salad. It was really good.~salsa chips chips tuna salad. ~3
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~2kpMrl6yePx9RBmSgYmLRA~Their fresh and warm chips and salsa were good. Ordered a margarita and immediately understood why they limit you to only 2. Woo hoo! I was feeling good. I had one of their specials which consisted of salmon and mango salsa and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken fajitas and said those were good too.   The white chocolate tamales as an after dinner snack (small dessert) was nice, but we still ordered cheesecake for dessert. I love cheesecake and have yet to try a bad piece.   I'm not a big fan of Tex-Mex, but I'd come here again.~chips salsa salmon mango salsa chicken fajitas white tamales ~3

I had the salmon and a bite of the steak. SOSOSOSOSO good. Ahhh I want their chips now.   Also. The chocolate tamales were a sweet fare-thee-well. Yum.~chips salmon steak. chips tamales ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~fNpYit0BdaLXy_woHwForQ~So my sister was in town for a visit.  She and her hubby live in Monterey, CA, and she decided that she needed to THAW from 50 degree weather!  We were meeting our friend Kelly for dinner, and she suggested Sam's Cafe.  I've been to the one downtown, and really enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to checking out this location.  First of all, the chips and salsa ROCK.  The chips are freshly made, and the salsa is this chunky, chipotle-infused bowl of heaven.  I got the fish tacos -- they were fantastic.  A filet of blackened tilapia, slaw mix, pico, and this chipotle sauce.  Would absolutely recommend this to anybody that likes fish tacos -- sooooo good!  Kelly got the carnitas platter and my sister got the chopped salad.  I didn't try either of their dinner, but they both enjoyed theirs.  Our server was excellent -- she was attentive, without being annoying, and kept our glasses of iced tea full -- which was a good thing after being at the pool most of the day.  To sum it up -- good food, good service, and reasonable prices.~chips salsa chips salsa tacos -- tacos -- carnitas salad. tea ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~xVU5OYmFk1D16LdIc8fjRA~This is the place that we always seem to end up at when people come in to town for business. It's one of those places that's relatively convenient, has decent parking, and can handle larger crowds since they don't ever seem to be even remotely busy.  I will agree that when I have been there with small, personal groups, service has been unbearably slow. They would definitely earn one more star if there were even a whiff of concern... but when the group is larger, we have always received exemplary service - dare I say size does matter?  The food is actually above standard, for its kind. I love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast (it has lots of goat cheese inside and is covered in their red pepper cream sauce - which honestly I think would be good spread over an old leather sneaker). I could eat the Adovo Chicken Pasta twice a week and never get tired of it (same reference to red pepper cream sauce). My ex swore that the Meatloaf was the best (but really, what can't be improved by a generous portion of bacon?!!). And my all time favorite has to be Chile Rubbed Sirloin - it's flavorful, without being overpowering, always cooked exactly as requested, and generally requires the threat of forking when others realize that "it looks better than mine."  If you like Margaritas. You should be happy with what Sam's has to offer. The Orange Beso makes my toes tingle. Fortunately, they limit those to two servings - otherwise I might find myself behaving badly. They have several "house margaritas" all of which I've enjoyed (really it's not my fault, I work with a lot of social alcoholics... it's the only way to deal with the stress).  My final offering is that this particular location (I haven't ever tried at the others, so they might be accommodating as well), is great for private functions. They will basically close down whatever portion of the restaurant you might need, either feed you buffet style or from the menu, work with you on drink coupons, let you hang corporate flair, etc.  If you are in a pinch for a business gathering in a relaxed environment give it a try.~chicken cheese chicken pasta meatloaf bacon? ~3
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~2nJFl2RiZ_1x3zUnQvd2eQ~A friend of mine is in town and staying at the Ritz Carlton on Camelback. In meeting up, we ventured across the street and found Sam's Café. The menu was big and many things looked good. I was busy looking at the spacious dining area and the food options when the waitress arrived. My friend went with the raspberry margarita while I had  1/2 coke,  1/2 diet coke.   The waitress was very attentive and dropped by many times to make sure we were fine. The chips and salsa were amazing! I saw some Yelp reviews on my phone that talked about the chips. I thought really? They are chips! Can they really be that exciting? Damn skippy! In fact, most of the time I didn't even put them in salsa-  they were so good just by themselves.   My friend ordered the Red Rock Meatloaf served with peppers, bacon and onions, mashed potatoes and she swapped spinach in place of the corn on the cob. I went with the Applewood Smoked Pecan Salmon. Damn! It was salmon with pecans, there was a side spinach and the salmon was served on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and a red papaya and serrano chile sauce. I detected something else that seemed like slightly spicy apple sauce, but I don't know what it was.  An excellent meal, nice atmosphere, descent area and above average service. Each entrée was about $17 and the margarita was $6.50. No room for dessert - with the exception of the white chocolate tamale brought out with the bill, but the tray showed several items. Maybe next time?~coke, coke. chips salsa chips. chips! meatloaf bacon spinach corn salmon. salmon spinach salmon papaya serrano apple sauce, white ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~m3ak2g3_6QSDBHz4BzVm4g~I think I had chicken enchiladas (my boyfriend ate most of it).  My boyfriend wanted to go to Phoenix/Scottsdale for Southwestern food while my friend was in town for agency visits.  She got the waiter to take a photograph of us and when she spilled her margarita, they replaced it.  We chose this because we wanted a casual restaurant with salmon or shrimp.  We didn't know any better if this stuff is just fake Tex-Mex.~chicken salmon shrimp. ~4
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~QCFPAq0-D9ZGX0GyS9862w~Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Café.  Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:) I say "judge slowly" and "give people a second chance" and "a stitch in time, saves nine" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order. Sam's Café had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be "dollars" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!). But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we? The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!). Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished. How about a nice big lunch? Sam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Well, that's just inspired! We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour "move" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:) We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices. We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  "go-to" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo). While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa.  Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more "southwest inspired" as opposed to "southwest", or "Mexican" or "authentic".  They have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes! Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:) The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty.  The pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders "flew" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice. All in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip). Go, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!~date, pork chicken chips salsa. chips salsa... tortilla chips ~3
0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA~IuMn0cxnMEXUYDnafOb6Ew~Like most restaurants at the Biltmore Fashion Park (and malls in general), Sam's Cafe feels very corporate (and it is part of the Canyon Cafe chain), but don't let that hold you back here.  While there are better Southwestern places around, Sam's does a decent job with everything.  I've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.  Jake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.  While the food quality is OK here, it's just that - average.~chicken soup quesadillas. date date. date date steak steak ~3
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~tI63NIfcuJ5v5S0ZmBZ3HA~Ordered oysters which were very fresh. The veal chop was horribly cooked - medium throughout but completely rare towards the bone (indicates it was frozen prior to cooked). Also got the neptune platter which had an assortment of apps - it was horrible, scallops dry, tataki was dry without taste, shrimp was cooked on the outside but not the inside. This was very disappointing. Service was horrible and waiter was very argumentative when we brought to his attention the veal chop and in fresh seafood.  This place is a big no. I would not recommend going to this place unless you plan to get sick from eating the horrible seafood.~shrimp ~1
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~B8Yop0USKQdIvrvrtz772g~Been there 4 years ago. was expecting the same treatment. but NOT. Ask for a rare steak and they bring a really cook steak to me. Me and my boyfrienf wasnt happy . i was waiting for the waitress to ask how the meal was, if we like the plate. Didnt even bother or past by. maybe beacause she was busy to pamper her chic looking customer in the other table. Anyways i will never go back there because u got forget if u dun look like a rich old person. Terrible... go the check 127.93 dollars leave 18 dollars tips. we left a decent tips even all of that we had tell the waitress after paying the bill she just got nicer when she was what we tips her. what a shame.  Will never go back there. i think u can get better meal and service somewhere else.~steak steak ~1
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~nu36a_0GQ8lXmKkzv_cwGg~I went here on Tuesday, April 24th while in Montreal for a business conference.  I dined early and alone, and was extremely pleased with this venue.  My service was attentive without being overbearing, and the atmosphere was refined and "hip".   I had a beet salad as a starter - prepared beautifully, and I actually took a photo of the plated presentation....and I am NOT a "take pictures of food" kind of traveler.  I went for the New Brunswick salmon with almond foam and mixed wild mushrooms, and it was simply perfect.  Fish prepared just flawlessly, mushrooms had a unique and varied texture and the appropriate light seasoning to let the "shroom" taste through.  I did not have dessert, but did have a cocktail, and total was 48$ CAN before grat.    Would absolutely go back, without question.  Was French without being overbearing and intimidating, and there were some incredibly artistic sounding dishes on the menu.  Amazing daily specials, but I was locked into the salmon from viewing the menu on the outside of the restaurant entrance.  Safe area - I walked to and from dinner on my own from hotel, and was extremely comfortable as a woman traveling alone.~beet salad salmon almond mushrooms, mushrooms salmon ~4
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~VxEyGaTMLve0IfFA9ccoFg~A one-star blah. This place will be closed down and forgotten before the coffee is served. Let me premise this by saying I'm not one of those usual review whiners that can't find anything good about anywhere. La Coupole was simply disappointing.   When we walked in, I thought that it would be such a fine, impressive place to bring out-of-town, business guests. However, the food and service did not live up to the standards of the atmosphere and the hotel it's attached to.   We went as a group of about twelve guests for a business lunch today. A few of us ordered the catch of the day, which was the red snapper. However, it was so flavourless and tough that it tasted like the catch of yesterday. The parsnips that came with it were tasty though. Two people ordered the hanger steak, which presented beautifully and looked delicious, but they both said their meat was cold.  Some of the waitstaff were nice, one seemed very inexperienced and a couple of others seemed snooty and apathetic. One served my salad in front of me, then without asking if  I'd ordered it, took it away and gave it to someone else. I even stopped him to ask him why he was doing that, yet he ignored me and continued on serving it to the other individual. They only offered us coffee and tea after we were almost through dessert.   I'll be recommending to my colleagues and friends that they go elsewhere. This town is too big for below average in a pricey `n pretty package.~coffee steak, salad coffee tea ~1
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~s7gbar7dkCGLBf5ecsHELg~Don't go here.  I ordered the shrimp while my dinner companion ordered the steak.  Steak was okay.  Shrimp was so awful.  The bean puree, tomatoes and mushrooms accompanying the shrimp all had a terrible burnt taste.  If i wasn't starving and short on time pre concert I would have left mid dinner.    Service was also terrible.  We got our appetizers before our drinks.  And if we needed anything (salt, another glass of wine) we waited a good 10 minutes before our waitress even came over.  I was excited initially that they could seat us on a Friday pre concert without reservations but now I know why.~shrimp steak. steak shrimp mushrooms shrimp appetizers ~1
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~bZ1FLsmPOMBdgjbyR2reVg~I wish I could give less than a star.  We are Saturday and It's Montreal en Lumiere. There's a special Brunch Menu for the occasion. My friend Karine heard good things about La Coupole so we decide to give it a try. We make a reservation for 3.  I arrive 10 minutes late, my friends are already at our table. The first floor is completely empty and its 12:40. There around 14  people (approx 5 tables) in the second floor. Our server give us the menu and coffee.   We get our appetizer after 25 Min. Its a bit long for smoke salmon and oysters. My oysters are not very cold and only get a piece of lemon and a sour sauce as garnish. Nobody is impress with their plates.  We wait another 40 Min to get our second dish. We all ordered egg Benedict and they are all overcooked. So basically not really an egg Benedict. There's a table spoon of hollandaise sauce and the plate is really sad looking. Finally after more than an hour of service we finally get our first glass of water and toast. If you compared it with eggspectation, im telling you, eggspectation is just Wayyy better and you won't feel rip off.  At this point I don't even want to complain. We had 2 different server and now the manager is serving us. Its really strange because overall we had 4 different server (3 server and 1 manager) doing the service. The manager took a while before finally taking out finished plates. He made and inappropriate comment to my friend about her not finishing her potatoes that made everybody uncomfortable.   My friend told me then that when she arrive 15 min early for brunch the manager told her really seriously to wait outside. when she was about to turn around and leave he told her that it was a joke... so you can have a good picture of the brilliant type of manager running that place.   Finally for our last dish, my friend who is a pastry chef got pastries of course. The cake was sooo dry just trying to take a bite was work. our plates once again looked all very sad. the waiters were all trying hard too look very busy with their now 4 tables.   We were the 3 of us debating and thinking hard to realize it was all our worst service we ever had. on top of it we all make better food than what we had serve. It was not quality food and we all paid 40$ for that.  I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ON YELP!  Save your money, nobody deserve that, the service took 2 hours. its is now 3h24 and I feel bad for having paid for that.~coffee. salmon lemon egg egg pastries cake ~1
AVLKTVoB43D3sVBtSxsz_Q~4MhWcimAPgsmRtvs6ftylg~Gah , I don't know what to say about this place in all honestly . Fact is the first time I came here back in 2011, I had lunch et with a peer and it was a completly amazing experience filled with good food.  This was not the case on my second experience as I've been disappointed by the food. My salad accompanied by deer meat was okay . However , the main plate did not respond to my expectations as I had brunch previously with a friend back in 2011. Fact is my meat tasted extremely salty due to the sauce which really was not pleasant, especially when it covered the asparaguses and pretty much ruined the vegetables. As a result , I was not really satisfied about this main dish, especially for that price .  Anyway , La Coupole really screwed up this time , but will I give them another chance? Most likely as the service was excellent. Nonetheless , it is important to note the food proportion which is mediocre and that it is still a pricey restaurant.~salad ~3
1_VZR-M44VcvKVrfAyyZAA~plyvzZ99I_uZTcuxvAC0tg~After this last Friday, I will not be going here as often as I was. They have different colored tags, which on certain days are up to 75 percent off. This is awesome. CHEAP STUFF. You can call and check, or they have a sign with the dates that certain tags are discounted. I just got a whole bunch of Time Life Foods of the World books for a buck fifty each. I like that. Now, on to what I don't like.  I noticed a while back that they hired a new manager for the store. I now know that all of the nice, HARD-working elderly women that staff the store are unpaid volunteers. Meanwhile, the creepy Xtian white guy gets paid to lord it over them- while actually doing little of the real work. I have observed this every time I've been there. Do these women complain? Not to me. They do the work of pricing, organizing, cleaning, ringing folks up and every other thing- and they do it with a smile.  The creepy manager dude? Well...the first thing he did to me (this was about a month ago) was ring me up with my debit card and then proceed to address me by my name which he read off my card. In a very familiar, conversational way.This felt smarmy and boundary-violating. I never introduced myself, and I didn't know his name- although I do now; it's Ken.   So, what happened on Friday? He hit me. Yes, this creepy dude actually SMACKED me on the arm as I brushed by him while entering the store. I did not body-check him, honest. He then said to me in this petulant voice: "Are you even paying attention?" I said: "Paying attention to what?" I then realized what his problem was, but didn't have much sympathy since he had just smacked me on the arm like a pathetic 12-year-old dweeb. I asked, "Is anything broken? Do you think you'll survive?" I think he got the point. Maybe his mother didn't teach him how to say "excuse me"?  Hey, creep: it is NOT OK to hit your customers. And, I think it's really wrong to not pay the women who do the vast majority of the work, while you get a salary to "manage" them.  So, I'll still stop in for discount stuff now and then, but I will continue to avoid any further direct interaction with the creep who 'manages' this store. Hopefully he won't confront or touch me in any way again- if he does, there will be a BIG problem. God bless!~white ~2
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~8SYCrtHtNioIL0_UeGb1xw~This is a kid friendly chill out cafe with lots of the same food that Anna offered at the Downtown Market. We're so glad to have this restaurant in downtown with great choices for breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner.  My son's favorite is the Gypsy Stew, a wonderful blend of fresh vegetables, squash, and garbanzo beans. The panini sandwiches and quesadillas are also a big hit. We're looking forward to trying one her new breakfast menu items on our next visit.~sandwiches quesadillas ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~-fjXwcKBk37iF_fFNayCZg~This is my new favorite local foodie spot.  Came in for Sunday brunch with my girlfriend and we ordered two of their specials, the salmon/rice/egg scramble and the blueberry pancakes with homemade whip cream and honey syrup.  Also got their "orangeade" and moroccan mint tea.  the salmon/egg/rice scramble was FANTASTIC. came with a side of spinach with this delicious dressing that we both devoured.  it totally hit the spot and was just the right temperature (i have a problem with things either being too hot or too hold when they're served).  i wish this was a regular item on their menu because i'd be in here every day.  the blueberry pancakes were wheat i think, which made them not as moist as regular pancakes, but the blueberries inside of them provide the perfect amount of juiciness.  Honey syrup was different but what really made the pancakes was the whipped cream.  My girlfriend commented on how it was "just like her grandma made it".  Always a good sign :)  Like most of the other reviewers said, service can be slow, but I didn't mind, as I wasn't in a mood for things to move too fast.  Can get a little hot in there, as it seems they don't have A/C, just fans and a swamp cooler, and the art on the walls could use some help.  But I love the simplicity and design of the place, and considering I moved just down the street, this will definitely be a regular spot of mine to hit up.  Can't wait to try all of their menu items!~pancakes honey tea. spinach pancakes wheat pancakes, honey pancakes ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~p1X-3vxkjpuQ6cxv-ccQTw~The only place I know of in Phoenix where you can get a fresh vegan breakfast, with new specials each week. I love the tofu scramble, sometimes they have a tofu and veggie breakfast burro which is absolutely to die for. The owner and staff are always very friendly and have always been happy to accommodate any special requests I've made.~tofu tofu ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~w6kp2NZTgGFKBUL2GaK06g~Now I know why Emo guys can fit into jeans made for tween girls, they eat at places like this. It would make sense; this must be the target audience with this location.  I arrived just past noon with a co worker, luckily there was a police car parked nearby so I was not afraid to leave my car in this less than ideal neighborhood.   From the outside it looks modern, trendy and bright.   Inside are white tables and chairs, seating is limited but their business also seemed to be a bit limited. After hearing about the specials and looking over the menu I chose the Blue Cheese Quesadilla with tomato Marmalade as I do love blue cheese.   When my meal arrived I was shocked how small, pale and pedestrian it looked. Unlike the photo provided my quesadilla was much smaller made with an out of a package soft taco sized tortilla. Accompanying it was a small almost garnish sized dollop of rice salad on top of some baby spinach greens. The rice salad was cold, and flavorless, cold rice is rarely a good culinary choice.   My quesadilla was under done and unevenly browned, there was plenty of marmalade but not too much cheese. The flavors just did not work for me even when I tried to pair it with the apple garnish.   My coworker ordered the lentil soup special of the day. It came in a small cup with a challa spinach and cheese Panini on the side. When a ~100lb female says hr portion was small you know it must be small. She enjoyed the soup, and felt the Panini was just mediocre filler.   My second drink refill, when it finally came was warm as they had no ice in the pitcher.  I see no reason for me to try another meal here.~white cheese tomato cheese. taco salad spinach greens. salad cheese. apple lentil soup ~1
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Y_hpI3MiODb4YzTj__btZg~In my quest to find a Palatte replacement, I ate at Sapna.  Amazing.  Well crafted tasty food in non-american portions. The eggs with the tomato sauce -- the eggs were farm fresh and I could taste the carmelized onions. And the pint of gazpacho brought me back to Seville.  I did think about spiking with some good vodka for a sublime bloody mary.  Fantastic tea, great coffee, charming service, bright beautiful location. Please stay open -- I'll pay for business education classes.~tomato gazpacho seville. tea, coffee, ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~9pb-FmDNpIw2aKC1gHm-kQ~The first thing you notice about Sapna Cafe are the windows pouring natural light into this neat, white space. (For shape, think of the Flatiron Building in New York on a tiny, tiny scale.)  The windows are covered with thin 15-foot mix-and-match drapes tied to reveal Grand and 13th Ave. views.  The vaguely triangular dining room gives way to a door frame through which you find the blackboard menu and register, where you order.  I took two friends on Saturday during Art Detour for a late lunch and the place was about half-full with the owner and one other person working.  There are two daily specials, and I had the Garbanzos and Eggplant in a Coconut Milk Curry, which came with brown rice, baguette pieces, and a side salad of field greens modestly but flavorfully dressed, all for $6.50.  The curry was rich, warm, and filling, and the firmness of the garbanzos went well with the butter-soft eggplant.  A great lunch for the price.  My friend Katie had the messy but delicious tabbouleh and chipotle hummus wrap, and my friend Kelly had a large salad with cranberries, almonds, goat cheese, and manchego.  It was dressed with balsamic vinegar only (no oil?), so the flavor was mostly sweet and tangy.  The drinks, we agreed, were on the subpar side.  The orangeade was inventive and attractive on the menu, but was mostly diluted and unsatisfying for $3.  Sapna's seems to be sorting out the ordering, serving, clean-up system, not to mention operating the register.  Ringing up sales took about 3-5 minutes per patron, and you pay at the end.  The half-eaten and abandoned sandwich at the adjacent table remained for our entire hour lunch.  Nevertheless, I am so grateful for fresh, interesting food on Grand Ave., and I'm confident Sapna Cafe will work out the service issues.  I will return.~white coconut milk brown salad greens butter- salad cheese, sandwich ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~drDnE_2wTj9Q3oqL-E14bg~While on the walking tour at the Grand Avenue Festival I thought I'd stop in for a quick bite. I'd heard great things and was excited to try something new. The place was busy, sure, but not packed. After my experience today I can say I'm not impressed.  The people working seemed flustered and disorganized. No one seemed to be in charge. It was chaos.  I ordered toast. It took 40 MINUTES to get my damn toast!!! I don't care how "busy" any place is, 40 minutes for toast is unacceptable.  The snarky worker gave me attitude when I asked how much longer it would be. "Well, we're busy" was the reply. But when I pay $3.79 for toast with butter and I don't have it 40 minutes later, being "busy" isn't the response I want to hear.  I don't really care how great the food is. It could be the best food in the entire Valley and I wouldn't go back. But if you chose to go, make sure you bring a novel and have no where else to be the rest of the day.~butter ~2
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~pyPCe8441YsXXb7QI80O2w~this was my second trip for breakfast to sapna and again, i was the only customer in there for over an hour.   not that i was in a rush, but damn man, it is like molasses in there. so slow....the waiter guy....just...just...i don't know what it is about some of these uber hip places....like the orange table....couldn't give a rat's ass if you ate there or not, just as long as you look forlorn, angry, or wearing an emo-mullet.   coffee was cold and like other reviewers, feels like forever to get refill. and this time, my portion seemed a bit less filling. a baked scramble with tofu, tomatoes and cheese, it was wicked hot and i nearly suffered 3rd degree burns when i rotated my plate. i felt like i could've eaten 2 more....good, but kinda small. i've had better.   but the kicker came, and i don't know why i didn't fuss about this in my last review was the price. 10.75 for that small portion and 2 cups of coffee. i know, i know, i'm so hypocritical....i want good, local ingredients but i don't want to pay the price (did you know you can get an enormous breakfast that would fill 3 people for under 5 bucks?). what's a cheap bastard to do?   in the end, not a great exprience this time. will check back later....~molasses coffee tofu, cheese, coffee. ~2
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~pMKlgGQIQT7UD7EP_aQ3eA~I've deeply enjoyed Anna's stall at the downtown farmers' market and am delighted to [belatedly] learn she finally opened her cafe.  We went yesterday and had specials - a libation of gazpacho with beet instead of tomato as a base [surprisingly delicious and thirst quenching] - her filling take on a Spanish omelette and a pasta dish garnished with carmelized onion, bleu cheese and crushed walnut - again suprisingly delicious.

-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~aB4LhTFNCEPgQ0gjhcg49g~finally got to try this place out! i went for lunch on a friday but arrived early because of warning of slow service. these rumors seem to be true. i ordered the watermelon rosewater beverage which was refreshing and not too sweet, and the goat cheese and red pepper quesadilla which was heavenly. the only problem with it was that it wasn't six times bigger. i seriously considered ordering another. and another. the red peppers are made into a marmalade, so they're sweet; sweet and unbelievably delicious.  i also ordered the eggplant and chick pea salad because they were out of the lentil salad. the dressing was citrusy and light, but there was a little too much of it on the salad. otherwise, it was delightful. a simple salad.   service was friendly, albeit slow, but they easily accommodated my friend who was unable to eat starchy products. they cooked up an off-menu delicious spanish-style vegetable dish with eggs and chorizo. she was smitten.   my only complaint was that it was very, very hot in there. true, it's august, but i was sweaty when i left. and they were all out of dessert which may or may not be a bad thing!~cheese salad salad. salad. salad. chorizo. ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~wONjPsZ_8qVC6cu2lkb-0w~I had the brie and carmelized onion quesadilla and my husband had the calcutta egg roll.  Can't wait to try everything on the menu.   Ana was our server for our early saturday morning bruch.  When I first saw the small space and fold out chairs, I worried I had made a wrong choice, but when the food arrived we were blown away.  Never would have expected such depth in flavor.  Ana took the time to come out and answer questions about ingredients used and even went back to the kitchen to bring us the jar of an ingredient we'd never heard of.   Great place, amazing food.  I only wish I could have a calcutta egg roll everyday.~onion egg roll. egg roll ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Pv6Q-pnDfGuZV6YA-ZLV0Q~This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part.  eclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced.  I got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweet Anyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love.~salad. ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Yi7X9QyJMJnAzZ88BBh5QQ~The food is really very good. Always fresh and interesting. My favorite thing is the gazpacho.   Today, I went for lunch with a largish group of people. Even though the dining area isn't that big, we were all accommodated nicely. They even split up the tab for us! (there were 9 of us) I love that they have really tasty vegan fare which in this city can be hard to come by.   Here are my issues. Although the owners/servers are nice, the service can be really really bad. I'm not a pessimist, but why would a waiter only fill up a glass of water halfway? Also to describe the non-vegan special today, our waitress said "oh, you know, it's like fish and rice and tomato sauce" appetizing....  I prefer my servers to have social skills.   BUT I still recommend going here. The food is good, and it is a locally owned establishment.  I can't wait to come back and visit Phoenix when the Grand Ave area really explodes.~gazpacho. tomato ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~u15s-Z-hR58oBJ8Fw2VV9w~The one thing that I always think when I see a small menu is, "these better be good." Sapna's menu is very small - about 15 items - but what they do have they do really well. A friend and I shared the Goat Cheese and Red Pepper quesadilla (awesome), we all had the veggie panini (mmm-mmm good) and drank Moroccan Mint Tea (perfect). The red peppers in the quesadilla were actually in marmalade form and tasted fantastic - I'd love to try the bleu cheese and tomato quesadilla. I loved the simplicity of the panini; all of the veggies were cooked just right. The sandwich didn't fall apart, but it was fully stuffed with goodies. And if I could drink the Moroccan mint tea everyday, I'd consider myself the luckiest woman in the world.   The decor inside is simple and the service was friendly. I love the sprigs of basil as the table flowers. We waited an average amount of time for our meals (approximately fifteen minutes) and the waitress was available when we needed her. There were a few other people inside besides my friends and me, but it was Phoenix on a Saturday night - I wouldn't have expected a crowd. I can't wait to go back to try the Gypsy soup and get another cup of mint tea.~cheese tea ( cheese tomato sandwich tea soup tea. ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~pcP0acfHpWdE62an_VnjmQ~This is a really nice, unique neighborhood place - the decor reminded me of South Beach a little. The menu is nice, although the pricing is a little odd. The $5 goat cheese and red pepper marmalade quesadilla was delicious but tiny. Meanwhile, we got a bigpiece of pound cake for dessert that was just $2.50. And my ginger lemonade was $3. I'd say both food items should have been about $4, and the drink $2. The paninis are priced right - $7 for a nice sandwich with a small side salad of mixed greens. All-in-all, the food gets a solid 4 stars. The service, however, is their weak point. It took 10 minutes for our server to come over to take drink orders and another 10 minutes for her to come back to take food orders...not a place to get in and out of quickly. Sapna is a great addition to this Grand Ave. area - now they just need to hone their service.~cheese cake ginger sandwich salad greens. ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~RmcDSw5Rr1pwMVAc9Eq-nA~Each time I've been to Sapna the food has been excellent! I've only had breakfast here and each time I order the frittata of the day. My husband has ordered the pumpkin pancakes and oh my god, these are some of the best pancakes I have ever had. The syrup is so yummy. I'm drooling just thinking of them.  We have also had the Calcutta egg roll, which is worth a try, but not sure I would get it again and the pork tacos which were just delicious.  The Moraccan mint tea is very tasty. A very refreshing iced tea with fresh mint leaves.   I love the food, but have to say the service is a bit hit or miss. As other Yelpers have said, you could be the only person in the place and hardly see your server. It's a small place, so I don't know how one person could go unnoticed. Really, the service isn't much to complain about as the food is so good I can kind of overlook the service.  I think once this place catches on they will have a line out the building like Matt's Big Breakfast and rightly so as I think the food is far more superior.~pumpkin pancakes pancakes egg roll, pork tacos tea tea ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~WAbcwtq6HdYGAgXSoBC1Lg~Wow, I have to say we were both underwhelmed...and I had hoped for so much more. I loved the building from the get go...had been there before and thought it was brilliant to open a restaurant in that space.  How cute!  Cozy and charming.  Loved it.    We arrived at 2:30 on a Saturday and we were told to take a seat - and then we waited quite a while for someone to come and take our order.  They never asked us if we wanted water, and the drink I had ordered was not available so we both ordered cold drinks - he had Ginger Lemonaide and I had Orangeaide.  Loved the Ginger flavor, but both the drinks were syrup sweet - which was not what we were hoping for - we like our citrus to have some tang. Then we ordered a bowl of soup, quesdilla with brie and onion marmalade (both for me) and a turkey sandwich with cheese and mustard sauce (him.)  Both our plates arrived and were very nice...but no soup ever came.  Then we waited, thinking the soup and the silverware was coming, and we waited...and waited...and no soup - and still waiting.  My lovely companion got up and stole some place settings from somewhere else and in doing so we snuck into the kitchen to inquire about my soup.  They said they forgot - which was cool - but apparently they had put it away and it was going to have to be reheated which meant we ended up sharing everything...except the soup.  Now for the food.....it was good - but not great.  It was somewhat bland.  It had great, fresh ingredients, but everything was tainted with something sweet.  The soup needed salt (they don't have any on the table) and the other items were meant to be sweeter - I guess.  So maybe this is a GREAT restaurant and I was just tainted by the slow service.  Or maybe we should have ordered something else.  I promise to go back - I refuse to give up on this place...It's just too damn cute!~ginger ginger soup, onion sandwich cheese soup soup soup - soup. soup. soup ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~n1DdcwE5klX-jRx-ZPZ7xQ~My mom and I tried this place today. We are both avid cooks - and picky but appreciative eaters as a result.  I've got to say, we were both pleasantly surprised by the special: Moroccan lentil soup served with bread and salad. The flavors were fantastic! And the soup was hearty.  There are options for vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters here. The food is Spanish and Moroccan inspired. The ingredients are incredibly fresh. The service is friendly. And the prices are affordable. All in all a good experience.  As other reviewers have noted, the pace is slow. This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry.~lentil soup ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~qpvhoX55qoUN4O31d15Xgg~When I was a kid, and a restaurant would close that my mom & dad liked, they would always say, "oh, darn, I guess we didn't go there enough."  Sapna Cafe is one of those places that I plan to go to enough!   It is so darn CUTE, great adaptive reuse of an unusual space on Grand Ave.   But most importantly, the food is AWESOME.     Friday night I stopped in for dinner solo - warmly welcomed.  But, sadly, only two other tables were occupied.   Two more came in while I was there.   Now there are only maybe 12 tables in the place, but still.    Based on the tasty food and the almost anachronistically low prices, this place should be rockin' every Friday night. Constantly changing menu, because everything is fresh-fresh-fresh.    I was also offered numerous off-menu options, by the lovely and friendly server, Paris, and settled on a linguine pasta with shrimp and pesto sauce.  Oh my it was so good I snarfed it right down, and wanted to pick up the plate and drain the remaining yummy olive oil pesto sauce into my mouth.  (But I didn't.  Really.)     Dessert was homemade Tapioca pudding, yum!   If you do Facebook, fan them and you'll get the planned special as an update every day.   Go, really - it's awesome.~pasta shrimp olive ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~9213S_JlngrscqXFmleydw~This place makes me happy. As a native San Franciscan, Sapna reminds me of the cute neighborhood cafes with amazing food and great prices. I had a delightful brie + pear combination panini, which was served with a salad lightly dressed in vinaigrette; to drink I had a ginger lemonade which tickled the tongue. Plus...the colors of the building are incredible. Can't wait to go back.~pear salad ginger ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Y9kV6l3kJ1EbO7dwupp7Jg~OK, having read the hot/cold reviews on Sapna and having a free Sunday to spend with my sweet baboo...off we went.   First of all...service issues listed in prior reviews are mostly true. This is not a "get 'em in, get 'em out" kind of place, so we didn't see our waiter that often. I was prepared for a slow experience, so it didn't bother me...much. That said, I do want a cup of coffee more frequently than every 20 minutes. Our server mentioned that a fresh pot was being brewed, so I understood the delay for the first cup. When he came out of the kitchen and refreshed all the cups at the other table, I was already itchin' for my second cup...DENIED! Didn't even come near our table to check on our caffeine level 8(  We both ordered brunch specials. I had the much bally-hooed pumpkin pancakes, which didn't taste all that pumpkin-y. I haven't yet decided if that is good or bad. The cream cheese/walnut topping was awesome and they were not skimpy with it. The pancakes were moist and delish. The leftovers (which didn't really fit into the chinese leftover box I was given) will be wonderful tomorrow a.m., I'm sure!  Hubby had a baked breakfast casserole. It smelled delish and he claims it was wonderful. It had spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato and cheese (and other stuff i'm sure) and was baked. It looked a bit runny, but after mixing it all together and slathering it on top of the home fries (which he claimed were good), it lost its runny appearance. Go figure!  I felt that the room could have used some sound deadening, as the group at the other table was a bit loud, but the front door was open and the street noise was non-existent. Cute atmosphere...all IKEA, all the time!  Our check was exactly $20 without tip/tax, so I felt like it was a successful outing. Great weather, great food, good (if not slow) service.   I look forward to a return visit to try other menu items, as many looked like stuff right up my alley!~coffee pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin- pancakes spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato cheese ( home fries ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~sVn2vcQio8o7YoYvY20Hpw~Solid menu choices.  Great customer service.   Sapna Cafe is a breath of fresh air along Grand Avenue.   Robert M and I drove past this place after arrive home from a vacation in San Francisco. Having dined out daily there, we were in no mood to cook but a bit apprehensive about eating somewhere that would disappoint. Sapna came to the rescue.   We split the Croque Monsieur panini and a tomato salad. The panini was fabulous; the salad a little too bitter for Robert's tastes but otherwise good. They don't refrain from their use of garlic in the latter, so it's best to share this on a date.   Apparently, this space can be rented out which would make a great party spot. Plus, they're working on getting a liquor license.~tomato salad. salad garlic date. ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~NikUgoCh6u3Do2yLdSP1uQ~Best gazpacho soup in town. (In a cup with a straw, yes!!!) Many of my friends have told me to dine at Sapna. Each time I have has been more than enjoyable ( Vegan options! esp. Breakfast! ) Great staff and intimate atmosphere.~gazpacho soup ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~x19-Gtp7COy5yxhmJFCsNA~Sapna.  Been here twice. Second instance first Friday. Met with my precocious sister and a girl with a similar hair style.   The waitress was charming and fresca like a cilantro roasted lime creme fraiche. As she explained the menu, she remarked on my visage and stated that I appeared unimpressed. Either I am easy to read or she is good at detecting mannerisms.  I ordered the quesadilla with goat cheese and red bell pepper marmalade. It was tasty. However the inner portion of the tortilla was soft and soggy from the cheese yet the ends were crisp and too brittle. All in all the dish was a good combination of flavors and adequately priced for the ingredients.  The coffee was good. That is a huge plus.   Finally they changed service in between our visit. A bit weird. An introduction would have been nice. They did not offer to refill my coffee nor served us water. Was their a shortage that I was not aware of?   Anyway, it is spartan and white with copious amount of window space. Not sure if I like it, but it is definitely a style.  I am excited that Dominique from Palette. is coming on board to come up with some ideas for the menu. YAY!~cilantro lime cheese bell pepper cheese coffee coffee white ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~VhZASeIdLBPw86aWXbrw6w~Our tradition on vacation is to seek out breakfast spots. We either find something near where we plan to go, something in route, or just plain go out of our way to have some place that has gotten killer reviews. This place is not the third one yet, but was on our way (mostly) to Goodyear. We were headed out for a ball game (of course).   From the direction we were heading, there was no real perfect exit to get off the 10, so we did a little round a bout thing. But, we got there and found it. Take a good look at the pictures, it helps when you are searching for this place. We got parked with no difficulty and were worried that the place might not even be open. It is pretty desolate around this area. Not too "scary" as Matt K's sister thinks, at least not at 10am in the morning.   THe place is cute. A triangular building with lots of windows. No huge sign to advertise, but maybe just being on YELP will help them. We walked in to the small main dining area. Lots of white ikea tables and chairs with cute flowers on all of them. Bright drapery covering the sunny side of the building's windows. Lots of natural light in here and very inviting. The staff greeted us right away and asked us to order up at the counter, as they do not have menus printed yet. So, I assume that is coming.   We walked through the doorway into more of a kitchen area that had a counter setup and a large board with menu items. There are daily lunch specials, about 6-7 breakfast items, a lunch menu and a heafty list of specialty drinks. This place is really a true "Asian" Fusion, incompasing all of Asia. But, with a dabble in a few extra places, we will just call this world fusion. There are lots of really creative dishes and things that I would not necessarily have put together. But, they work.   I ordered a Calcutta Egg wrap. This was really unique. The tortilla and the egg were like one. Inside there were veggies (too many onions for me, I will omit them next time), including carrots, cilantro, and tomato. They give you a side of sweet chili sauce to top it. Other than the onions that I fished most of out, this was DELICIOUS. I am not sure how they did the egg, but I do not have to know. I just have to eat it. SG ordered a scrambled egg plate with stir fried asian veggies. He loved the combination and was surprised to find how great it all was together.   We both stepped outside our norms and also got a specialty tea. We ordered the Indian Chai. It was very good. There were lots of other choiced that tempted me, but this one struck me first. I would love to go back and try the Ginger Lemonade. I am a sucker for ginger!  Overall, this is a good little place with some really fresh, tasty, creative menu items. I hope that the lunch traffic can sustain them, since they have such potential. COME ON YELPERS, get in there and check it out. It is close enough to stop in for breakfast or lunch and get a little bite, even if you take it out, rather than eating in.~white egg egg cilantro, tomato. egg, egg tea. ginger ginger! ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Rjwd7V57in6lS2_Bo2e28A~3.5 to be exact...Came here for lunch yesterday, and enjoyed the gorgeous weather over a glass of...gazpacho?   The space is really bright and airy, we went up and ordered at the counter and then slipped outside and moved our table into the sunshine. The man-friend and I split the veggie pasta special, the veggie sandwich, a glass of gazpacho, and each had a glass of ginger lemonade. Our lemonade came out first, and it was good. Not as gingery as I like it, but not surprising. I like a lot of ginger.   Next out was the gazpacho. The chef (and I think owner?) mentioned that she was from Spain, so I knew I had to give it a try. It was listed under drinks, but I didn't really imagine that it would actually come out in a glass with ice and a straw. I got over the presentation quickly. This was THE BEST gazpacho I've had in years. Totally pureed, garlicky, with breadcrumbs in the mix so it tastes a bit creamy. Basically, the real freakin deal.   It didn't take long for the rest of our meal to make it out. The pasta was really flavorful, with heaps of veggies piled on top of a hearty serving. The veggie sandwich wasn't a new favorite, but it wasn't bad, either. Both came with mixed greens salads and a vinaigrette. The salad was tender, the dressing was alright.   We had a bit of a glitch with our bill on the way out. Everything is manually entered into the system, old school style, so take a closer peek at your check.   There were lots of other tasty looking things on the menu like the Gypsy stew, pear and gorgonzola sandwich and some breakfast items, so we'll definitely be back.~gazpacho? pasta sandwich, gazpacho, ginger ginger. gazpacho. gazpacho pasta sandwich greens salads salad pear sandwich ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~qanOUJrk6B0Pqj8_TigBng~This place was a long time in coming, but well worth the wait. The food tastes as though it were served off your own stove, with grandma at the spoon. It's homey and tasty. I had the chiken potato soup (the daily special $6.50) and it was very tasty, accompanied by 3 toasted baguette slices, served dry for dipping, and a mixed green salad with a fruity vinegarette. The portions were perfect. I ordered the morroccan mint tea with much anticipation, but to my dismay it was not what i had in Morroco or Tunisia. I guess serving a tea glass filled completely to the rim with mint and tea will have to be a home made thing. ( Thinking back to my travels i wonder where they grew all that friggin mint? They had to sell it in bushells with the amounts in each glass.) My nephew ordered the chicken panini and it was delicious, but cost $7 because it comes with a salad.  There was a steady flow of patrons, so the food will rest assured be fresh. Not to many people know about the place which makes getting in and out easy. Best part is this location is directly across the street from ShopDevious.com so you can shop and eat on your lunch break with time to spare.   On the bad side, i tried to sit outside to enjoy the fresh air, but the street was so unleveled i ended up sitting sideways at the table which was on a downward slope, and my soup seeped over the edge until i could make a dent with the spoon, ending up all over my tray and plate. Next time i'll sit inside. Good thing the food was too good to notice the slope after the first bite (i even picked up my bowl holding it in hand at one point) it was so delicious.~potato soup ( salad tea tea tea chicken salad. soup ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~o8wdMmxmmvLSLgHTwqgoxA~Sapna.  I wonder what that means? The first thing I noticed was the bright airy space that felt like an oasis coming in from 100 degree mid afternoon weather. The girl working was totally adorable and sat us down with some menus. She immediately started gushing about the lentil salad, so I didn't get much time to look closely at the menu. I was too worried about hurting her feelings NOT to order the lentil salad, so we settled on that and the eggplant panini sans cheese.  best. salad. ever. Extremely fresh tasting, local greens, lentils, and other veggies in a barely there lemon vinaigrette.  And some pita on the side. The panini was okay. Yummy rustic whole wheat bread. As we munched, I noticed the lush little patch of garden growing by the telephone pole outside. A grip of basil just basking away in DIRECT SUNLIGHT and looking fantastic. WTF I couldn't keep mine alive for a week!  Anyway. Total for the sandwich and salad was around $14. Not mad at that. I'll be back for nopales and a tofu scramble breakfast burrito.~salad, salad, cheese. salad. greens, lentils, lemon pita wheat sandwich salad nopales tofu breakfast burrito ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~V5oFzUcSzKzR3BFDbwhRTw~This is the cutest place with great healthy food options.  I love the decor and shape of the space, triangular, light and airy.  I had an eggplant and onion panini and some ginger lemonade.  Totally fantastic.  Great little spot for a light brunch after Mass.  Looking forward to visiting again!~onion ginger ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~12qrh_ofOHndIFAF0puWSw~I want to like this place a lot. Grand desperately needs some strong eateries. Sapna seems like it should be excellent: cheap, healthy food in a unique triangle-shaped setting. So what went wrong?  I've given this place several tries. Every time the service is terrible. They're understaffed (even when we were the only table there... one person working at a restaurant isn't possible), and if there are more than three employees there at once, they always get confused. I'm not sure what the reason is...the place only has like eight tables.   Second, the atmosphere is depressing. Sapna has a really different setting in the tip of the Bragg's Pie building. If anything, the atmosphere should be the automatic winner. Instead, it's a plain white room with plain white plastic tables. Last time I was in there, the one painting hanging on the wall fell off, hitting a patron in the head. Then it took several minutes for the server to get him some ice. He had a nice ole welt.   I like the quesadillas here a lot. The food is fresh... just not always tasty. The ratatouille is strong. I have yet to find a really great salad on the menu.~pie white white quesadillas salad ~2
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~vKVin4Q96jwRTLsu5bb3sA~I'm pretty disappointed because my first visit to Sapna was really awesome! My second visit was unfortunately not....  I went in last night to get some take out from the restaurant, lets just say Sapna is not prepared to do take out orders! I ordered the Gypsy Stew for $5 and the daily special ( garbanzo bean salad) for 7.50 my total came to around $13. When I got home and opened the bag of take out, my gypsy stew was placed in a 6.0z  to go coffee cup. I was a little put off by that, and then I look down and the garbanzo bean salad was placed in the smallest lil' container I have ever seen. I was upset because I had just paid $13 for this meal and waited 10 minutes for it to arrive to me.  I ate the food and it was good, but I was upset about the fact I had just paid $13 for a ridiculous amount of food! It is a good restaurant, but for dine in only.... I also feel the restaurant staff/ owners could use a little lesson in organizational skills.~salad) coffee salad ~2
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~4x9rfwKs_kN2uaU2CHOAjg~Cute decor but uncomfortable seats with odd table heights and slouching chairs. The menu selection was neat and small, which is refreshing. Prices were good and  the fresh portions were a perfect size. They have very well blended perfect pairings of exotic foods. I was going to get the indian soup special until the waitress announced that it wasn't spicy, as a sales pitch. Some of us love spicy.~soup ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~h_6p3hllH66g9ub12CK4yA~Sapna Cafe is one of those places I would have missed had it not been for the Urban Spoon App on my iPhone. I love to try new places and this place is certainly worth trying. The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh and tasty. I had one of the daily specials. It was sort of like a breakfast burrito with eggs and other goodies in a tortilla with a side salad made of fresh greens. I also had the Ginger Lemonade and even fresh Strawberries and Creme. I wish them well, I will be back again.~breakfast burrito ~5
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~Ed_PIe7-hIpyOTJS2RJSdA~The food here is just average. I wanted a hearty breakfast this morning, so I invited my friend Seene to join me.  I ordered scrambled eggs with vegetables and a cup of coffee and my friend ordered a sandwich with salad.  All of it was competently made but nothing jumped out as being hearty and good quality. My toast were this two sad little biscuits. :(   I really wanted to like this place, but there just doesn't seem to be enough special about the place to give it four stars. On the other hand, the positive side is they have vegan options.~coffee sandwich salad. ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~C4gIlX9IZsaV13-Br26h1w~Everyone, in your best Joe Pesci (lethal weapon style) voice - "Ok, Ok, Ok". Yes, just like Joe gets excited, I'm totally excited about this place.   After dying to get there for like the last month, I finally made it. Uh oh, though, I look at the menu, and oh great more salads and panini's. I mean really?, is that what downtown needs. Hannys, postino, lisa g, local breeze, hob nob- great, sandwiches. :(  Then (insert angelic chorus - "ahhhhhhhh") the waitress walks through the specials. Lentil salad, salmon over greens, tofu pasta, garbanzo bean salad, et' voilà!  Low and behold, I went with the lentil salad. What do NBA fans say?- "Its Fantastic"! A mixture of lentils, carrots, zucch - all over greens. Mmm, yum. The wife went on to have a panini, and you know what, I'll be eating crow for sure. Pears, Brie, walnuts all on wheat bread, then grill - mmmmmmm.   Let's top it off with the chocolate mousse, shall we? Yes we shall!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen - another fine course.   The atmosphere is clean, but bright and casual. Give this place a shot- open your mind and have some fun!~salads sandwiches. salad, salmon greens, tofu pasta, salad, salad. lentils, greens. wheat ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~RP2nHWAYJ5i1C68AP7QWCA~i love this place.  the food is always delicious and well prepared.  my favorite dish at the moment is the tofu scramble with veggies, it never disappoints me.    the space is clean, airy and bright.  the staff is friendly and attentive.  i took my (picky) sister here for lunch when she visited from out of town and she made us go back for brunch on the way to the airport!~tofu ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~IolfrVaStebCcA5heGA5Ug~Cute little space in a mostly anonymous part of downtown that is often neglected. Nice people serving up quality, healthy, mostly organic food. Vegan-friendly, but with a little something for us meat-eaters too. Small menu, quick and easy. Interesting desserts and juice/teas and great lunch specials. I like the chicken sandwich, but I'd pass on their quesadillas since for the price you pay, it's sort of a meager meal. you get more bang for your buck with the other items on the menu. A great addition to Grand Ave.~desserts chicken sandwich ~3
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~9Tn4bARD7zioawpA-RlmDg~update - Sapna is now closed  Sapna is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and I am so fortunate to live just down the street. The owner, Anna, is from Spain and has travelled the world, and she competently reflects her time in Spain, India, Mexico, and elsewhere in her dishes.   The food is most important, and this is where Sapna shines. A regular at the Downtown Farmers Market -- both as a vendor and a buyer -- Anna's food is local, fresh, organic, and filled with vegan and vegetarian options. Rarely do I order off the menu, as Sapna's specials reflect what just came off the farm. Yes, I have had a dish or two that didn't wow me, but the homemade pasta is some of the best I've ever had, and the paella is right out of Spain (when it is included with the specials).  The space is small, but charming. Shaped like a slice of pie with large windows on both sides of the angles, the spot in the Bragg's Pie Building is fun, casual, and filled with local art for sale. The floors are unfinished, the furniture is from Ikea, and the tables have basil or whatever is currently growing in the outside containers in small vases; and sometimes they are growing roots in the water. High end? No. Quirky? Sure.  The service is friendly, but can be slow if the place gets full. If you want fast and typical, Sapna is not for you. If you like fresh and local from a talentePhoenix owner/chef, put this place on the top of your list!~pasta paella pie pie ~4
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg~egjr677TYWik6ESIzJVC_Q~Not a fan. A group of us swung by during June's First Friday around 830PM. We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what?   I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole. We didn't leave sapna until 10PM because the server forgot to serve me the cake slice i'd ordered at the same time as the soup.    Yeah I guess I'm a little bitter about it.~sandwiches soup potato. soup. olive cake cake cake corn bread olive cake sandwiches soup cake soup. ~2
0A4wL1DwQILnrRHE2Vd4xA~yaz7ShgF4mcqUipcnTcfvw~Been here a few times. Highlights include nice smoked meat that you can carve for yourself and a nice selection of food that they seem to take care of. Low include the fact that they seem to waste a lot of food because they refuse to label the food. Yes, it's mystery food time! Seriously... you have to guess what things are. What if you had allergies? What I thought might be chicken.... fish! A few dishes could use a little help and maybe an update. But otherwise it's a solid chinese buffet when you have that craving for cheap chinese fare ala all you can stomach. The service was good.~chicken.... ~3

0A4wL1DwQILnrRHE2Vd4xA~5Dv6TwRGvwkMTPr44jGfew~Went there for the first time last night - Similar to other buffets in the area, but there's a wider selection of asian inspired foods like sushi and noodles. There is a wok/grill station where you can pick your own noodles, veggies, meat and sauce and have a chef cook it up for you on the spot. In terms of desserts, I particularly liked their lemon pie and blue bubble gum flavored ice cream - 2 items I haven't encountered at other buffets in Montreal.  If you can fill up on sashimi, you may get your money's worth. It was 18.50$ on a Monday night, I believe the weekend prices go up to 25$ and children below a certain age eat free. Watch out for coupons if you live on the south shore, I've often seen promotions like "2 can dine" for a set price in local flyers. They no longer have a website so I would suggest calling them for prices or just walk in to see the food selection.~sushi desserts, lemon pie ice cream - ~3
Au42SOOswePU8ZsIFfrhhQ~XG7GHqSaBqCiBpi4SUTUiQ~I've been here twice and I would come back. I never painted a canvas before coming here and it has made me a fan of painting! I've even started painting in my free time at home. The teachers explain everything really well and make you feel comfortable asking questions. Your painting will turn out exactly like theirs, if you want, or you can deviate from their template and add your own special touches. It's a fun way to spend 2 hours and the time FLIES by when you're concentrating and having fun. It's also in a good location because after the class you can walk over to Mellow Mushroom or one of the nearby restaurants and get a bite to eat.  My only recommendation to them is to add new paintings to their calendar. I've already painted two that I like, and I want to schedule another visit but I'm not wow-ed by anything on the calendar yet.~mushroom ~4
Au42SOOswePU8ZsIFfrhhQ~3CeKOe7DqFQsdaP4HCK_jg~Went here with my lady for a date. The instructor was a bit hard to follow at times and moved too quickly others, but would help people when they were straggling. Over all was a fun time and we have a couple of mementos from it that we have on the wall.~date. ~4
Au42SOOswePU8ZsIFfrhhQ~nJOftU_z1d0r4dZ9m6lGvA~I just recently discovered this place only because of Living Social and they had a deal going on. $50 ($100 value) for a three-hour BYOB painting class for two. Materials included are: 16x20 canvas, acrylic paints, brushes, and an apron for each student. You can go on their website and check their event calendar to see what the instructor will teach that day. Each week is a different theme and they show samples of the instructors artwork on the calendars to show you as well. I choose the "Tree of Love" theme since I was going with my bf and thought it be a cool experience for our first time. You have to make reservations online or by phone.   We got there pretty early and was greeted by the instructor and she had us sign in and then told us to pick a place to sit. We were talking to her briefly since we were early and she was so sweet. Once everyone was in we got started and she goes over everything step by step to make it real simple. During the class, she will make sure that everyone is at the same pace and then she will proceed with the next step. Her assistance was out that day so her husband was the assisting for the night and he was taking pictures and helping people out if it was needed. When she announced that I was like awww, that's too cute! Her and her hubby teaching her class together!   Since this was a BYOB painting class, it really made the class more enjoyable with your significance other or friends. It just makes the activity more exciting since you're a little tipsy. I noticed one lady that came in and she even brought a big huge icebox for her BYOB lol. Now that's SMART, I am going to steal her idea and do that next time so my drinks are cold and ready! =)  Overall, I enjoyed this fun little activity a lot. My bf liked it too and we want to go back. We loved how our painting turned out so we got it framed and now it's hanging in our room. It was a good date night, and I would definitely recommend this place.~date ~5
3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg~vpZ2OrEsBwyEMAL0yXTUKA~I might be bias since I work at this campus but I gotta admit, the ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus has appeal. It's a different world compared to the Tempe campus which is a university campus surrounded by an urban setting, Downtown campus is a university set amidst an urban setting. No, it's nowhere close to New York University in Manhattan but where ASU is situated is that it's centrally located in the Phoenix downtown area next to the Transit Center, and an urban park. Everything is within walking distance, CityScape on Washington is less than 6 minutes walk and the Roosevelt Arts District is north of it and less than 5 minutes away. As a campus, it can be recognized by the School of Journalism building on Central, and the University Center building just south of it. Basically the campus starts at the YMCA building to the west, Journalism building to the north, Arizona Center and University Mercado to the east, and the University Center Building to the south. It encompasses more than 6 blocks. It's a good start for ASU, and it's nice to see the university expanding its presence downtown. I wish the university was in more buildings spread throughout downtown instead of a specific area, I think it will eventually get there with the revitalization of the Jefferson warehouse district south of the sport arena but right now it's a good place to be. :)~sport ~4
3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg~dQHcWydyuX9iYNhdAoypkw~I love this campus. It's within walking distance to my house and was inspiration behind me going back to school.  All my classes are in the same building, which is a bonus. All is all my professors offices.  I don't feel like I can knock it for it's expensive factor because I already knew that coming into it. But I will knock it a star because of it's food options are limited, perhaps too much so. I have money on my SunCard so I went to Taylor Place one day to score some food. I'm not a resident there so I was majorly peeved by the price of a lunch. It's $7.50 for a one hour time limited all-you-can eat buffet. I'd be happy if I didn't catch it just before dinner hit so I would have had some hot food choices, but no luck. They set the dinner food out and it was about 7 mintues before dinner started (4:30) and they were very concerned about not letting students devour that food until dinner opened.  So my "lunch" I was stuck with a $7.50 salad and stale cookie. I won't go back there. I'll stick to City Cafe limited hours and get another chicken ceasar wrap for $5.50 - still a bit pricey but it's basically what I had at Taylor Place wrapped up.  I like the lobby and the success center is a score. The professors are nice and open to concerns (for the most part) and are willing to work with you.~salad chicken ~4
3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg~bg5kDuCwAbb1jjIonrGMDw~I was invited to sit in on a nursing board meeting at the Nursing Innovations Center at ASU. I was highly impressed by the spaciousness of this campus and their modern up-to-date equipment. It is extremely clean and the property is nice and safe.  Our meeting took place in one of their large board rooms that had several large screen projectors. Parking at the meters are free on the weekend, that was nice and kept me at ease with parking. But I also found out after I parked that the Nursing Innovation building parking area is also free on the weekends, however it doesn't disclose that anywhere, security informed of the free parking. I wish this place wasn't so far from me is the drawback. I was honored to be part of this meeting as their guest.~date ~5
3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg~zcVeI92S00DXxbHmXPjYdQ~I'm applying to Grad School and I am so excited that most of my classes will meet here. It's right off the light rail and just a few blocks from downtown for those of us urbanites. It really doesn't get more convenient than this.  There are ample coffee and alcohol vendors closeby by for blowing off steam or cramming. Food options, not so much but Bowl of Greens is a good healthy alternative.~coffee greens ~4
3N9r9UcvEUlsEqE_yetmYg~4NE1CoElQjEL8UFkPsLweA~My father works as faculty for ASU, my mother graduated from W.P. Carey and I left U of A to come here. This school is near flawless (for me) and the downtown Phoenix campus is the icing on the cake. I consider this place to be my second home and have loved every second of my time here. Further, our journalism program is unbeatable. I have no complaints!~cake. ~5
-TYPafTH5Bd0smF7JYEkrA~R_UBYWX4fWwpqkncRs6iDQ~This place really is a hidden gem!  Nice quiet inn exterior right on the banks of the forth.  Inside is warm, welcoming and lets not forget the excellent food!  Being a steak fiend it would have been rude not to try the steak here.  This is simply the best sirloin steak I have ever tasted!  I am also happy to say when I asked for a rare steak it really did arrive as a rare steak!  I enjoyed every mouthful and will be back for more!  The range of desserts was impressive, unfortunately not all were available due to high demand but maple syrup waffles went down beautifully!  You simply MUST stop in here for a meal, be sure to book though!  The staff are polite and attentive, the atmosphere is fantastic and going for a walk along the coast when you are finished is the perfect end to a perfect meal!~steak steak steak steak steak! desserts ~5
-TYPafTH5Bd0smF7JYEkrA~Kg77ygpElsM7CVaZSsW6ig~If I were a selfish man, I would've hoped this place was not listed on Yelp.   Reason being, it's already very popular due to its fabulous consistency of food & service.   They present a truly excellent 3 course steak dinner in cosy Fife coastal pub surroundings.   I make a point of stopping by whenever I visit relatives in Scotland.~steak ~5
6-Q2bcA43ksojhp9MBL1cA~ocN0Gpy7kS-HrV-JGyo8yQ~Best downtown Montreal food court restaurant by far. Your typical Vietnamese combination plate\Tonkinese soup menu, done  properly with fresh ingredients. Great bang for the buck. Don't get scared by the huge lineups, it moves quickly and you are served in a matter of seconds. Bon appétit!~soup ~5
6-Q2bcA43ksojhp9MBL1cA~uwygbPmVJcMIy0RFjNOtEw~Who said food court food can't be good? Me. I said that. I said that BEFORE Caravelle. Their Tonkinese soup is delicious, hot, and the service is FAST. How many people do you need behind the counter for this tiny place?! Apparently just enough so you can join the line and get out of their before you can even decide what you really want.   You want the Tokinese soup. Join the line.~soup soup. ~5
6-Q2bcA43ksojhp9MBL1cA~Ua21w0zv1tlEsMbRLgaa9Q~If you're a little office bee like me working downtown, you're probably also on the lookout for little food court gems that stand out against your generic Thai Expresses, Franx Supremes and Sushi Shops.   Caravelle is a little Vietnamese joint in Place Ville Marie. I know. "Caravelle" doesn't sound Vietnamese, but it is. They serve pho, vietnamese sandwiches (that I hesistate to refer to as banh mi because they're not really authentic, but still tasty) and grilled meats served on rice or vermicelli noodles.  Look, it's not Pho Lien, but for a food court, this place is pretty damn good. You can even find some of the more adventurous pho fixings here like tripe and brisket and the soup isn't just "passable". It's probably the best pho option in the Golden Square Mile, and very cheap to boot!  This place is very popular at lunch time, so mentally prepare yourself for a long wait in line. The only reason I don't come here more often is that I work right upstairs and prefer to spend my lunch hour avoiding running into my coworkers like the antisocial hermit that I am!  And no, you shouldn't throw your bowl into the garbage, you asshole. It's a real bowl that's not meant to be disposed of. Give it back to the ladies at Caravelle, they'll appreciate it.  Bonus: Caravelle now accepts debit and credit cards!~thai sushi sandwiches ( vermicelli soup ~3
6-Q2bcA43ksojhp9MBL1cA~uYsPmeNQUlArbxzLdH5wFw~I work in a building connected to Montreal's underground city and occasionally will journey into the Place Ville Marie shopping mall during my lunch.  It is located on the outer edge of Place Ville Marie's food court somewhat close to the entrance the Central Station (Gare Centrale). During lunch time there will usually be a line-up at this place, however, the line moves surprisingly very fast.  When I am in the mood for soup at work for lunch, I will normally come here and have one of "Vietnamese" soups since I don't have to worry about the weather conditions outside as this place is within PVM and PVM is one of the buildings connected to the "underground city". The soups aren't as good as a place like Pho Lien but I find it good nevertheless. Not that it makes any difference to me but this "Vietnamese" restaurant is run/managed by Cantonese speaking workers (it might also be owned by them) so you won't get the variety/authenticity of a place like Pho Lien for Vietnamese soup.  The bowl size for the soup is decent. When eating at the food court, they ask you to bring back the bowl after you're finished.  They accept credit cards and debit cards. If paying by card, the cashier will show you the amount on the machine and ask about whether she can use the tap to pay feature.   I eat here a few times a month especially if I am feeling under the weather or feel a cold coming along.  I rank them 4.5 stars which like all my reviews, I've rounded the 0.5 up since I don't want to shortchange the restaurant. The only thing that could make this better is to have more variety in the soup but I feel that their soups are catered to non-Asians (so you won't get things like tripe in the soup or other exotic pieces of meat like you will find in a place like Pho Lien).~soup soup. soup soup soup ~5
6-Q2bcA43ksojhp9MBL1cA~ZFhCH_EguDi8wH0DSdFK-A~If you're around Ville Marie specially on a cold day, you should give their soups a try. There is a reason why there is always a big line. For the price the portion they serve are very good and the service is very quick. They also have viet sandwich and rolls.   Note:  I have been going to this place for years and the special of the day NEVER changed.~sandwich ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~g0OeKxoPghBFJsKfptz6YQ~Came here for an afternoon treat. I really enjoy the staff and the flavors they have are delicious. I know I only gave this three stars and I'd be lying if I said I didn't look forward to this afternoon treat but it's a pretty standard frozen yogurt place and I can easily get a similar place anywhere else.~frozen yogurt ~3
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~8_Ua122CAGK17qqTKz7rhg~Across the street from my office is a bad place for this yummy, delicious place to be. Have mercy on my waistline! Anyway, it's delicious -- every day some new frozen yogurt flavors and always the veritable plethora of toppings.   What I love about them is that they layer the frozen yogurt with whatever topping(s) you choose, so that it's all mixed together. I usually walk in with a taste for something, especially chocolate and peanut butter or vanilla and chocolate, and the owners always know just how to help me out. They always give free samples, so try whatever you want before committing to it!   Yum!~frozen yogurt frozen yogurt peanut butter ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~paskZWLYcpmpPveswYbkYQ~I found this place on my second to last day in Phoenix and I wish I'd come sooner.  I thought it was really affordable and they had some awesome flavors.  I ended up getting caramel while my coworker got banana with strawberries mixed in.  The guy working was really friendly and actually thanked us for stopping by...I can't remember the last time I got such friendly service.  Definitely recommend if you're downtown.~caramel banana ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~rsczu2qs7SZANCnFzThe7g~I think Yvette has the right idea for an afternoon treat. The one problem is, I couldn't wait until Friday, I had to go today. It is the perfect afternoon distraction . . . er . . . um . . . I mean treat . . . perfect afternoon TREAT!   There was a time that I was completely hooked on afternoon frozen yogurt and going almost daily. The winter weather helped break me of that addiction and now I'm back on what others would consider a "normal" schedule.   I love that the flavors change every day and you can print a calendar from their website showing the schedule of flavors. There are about eight different flavors in any given day, and one of them is a "No Sugar Added" flavor.   The OCD side of me really shines when a new month starts. I print the calendar, take out my highlighter, highlight all of my favorite flavors and those of my fro-yo addicted coworkers, and hang the calendar outside my cube wall. That way it is much easier for us to tell when we need to work time into our schedule to hit the yogurt shop.   The flavors that are typically highlighted are:  - Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow (served on the same day, really good as a swirl)  - Pistachio (really good with almonds as a topping, I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much)  - Butterscotch (reminds me of pudding cups back in the day)  - German Chocolate & Caramel Custard (also served on the same day and very good as a swirl)  - Irish Cream & Kahlua (not served on the same day, but the closest thing to drinking at work)  - S'mores (delicious with a graham cracker topping)  - And every once in a while I like the Reese's with (you know it) Reese's as a topping!!   See, with so many delicious flavors, it was hard NOT to go everyday. They have plenty of other flavors as well. The only one that I tried that I was not a fan of was the Root Beer Float. The flavor was there, but it wasn't the same without the soda!   Either way, stop by in the afternoon for a sweet treat, and maybe I'll see you there!~frozen yogurt banana & caramel ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~J9SmrcJT62l44_v6yim3VA~Now after my first visit and review I've been back a  few more times. On my most recent I was having a sugar splurge kind of day. I decided on a Medium and opted for the Monday special of one free topping.  Having sampled the low fat carrot cake flavor and its spice cake like flavor, I figured its would go well with chocolate and I topped it all with almond rocca. Oh boy, they filled the cup with both flavors halfway sprinkled  a few spoonfuls of almond rocca then proceeded to fill the cup with more yogurt and another couple spoons of rocca.  Needless to say this made my Monday soooo much better.~carrot cake cake almond almond ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~yv09Vsyqx5Uszx06CXbxnA~I've worked downtown for two years and had never stopped in to the froyo shop.    This is unfortunant since the owners are so lovely and their product is decent.  I can't say I like it better than Yogurtland in Tempe (see my review) but it is a good alternative in a pinch.  Like David B. says, they serve Miss Karen's frozen yogurt, so it is not tart like the newer PinkBerry or its clones throughout the US.  Also, you won't be able to have unlimited toppings or serve yourself the yogurt. Not as much fun.  But again, if you are looking for a non-fat alternative to ice cream, this is a great place to stop in.   I had their sugar-free standard flavor (raspeberry) it was tasty. I do like to go there in the afternoon during my workday.~frozen yogurt, ice cream, ~3
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~3VXmOWpNm18VSuXww4Vu0Q~Ever since I started working downtown, I vowed to continue my personal tradition of rewarding myself with something yummy and sinful...kinda like a pat on the back for a job well done for the week. In my previous life as a PR bitch in the private sector, I rewarded myself with libations--vodka/tonics with two limes for extra Vitamin C; vodka Collins with three maraschino cherries instead of one; cranberry and vodka because I heard it cleanses out your urinary tract; a dirty martini for those super grueling weeks.  Alas, when I started to work in the public sector, still in PR, I knew I couldn't pull that shit anymore. I had to re-vamp my rewards structure and take out the "sinful" from "yummy and sinful." That's when I discovered fro-yo...that's frozen yogurt to you all.  My co-worker took me out for coffee one day and quickly mentioned that there is a locally owned frozen yogurt shop on Washington and First Streets. She said they give hefty portions, so I thought to myself that this might just be a good replacement for my vodka concoctions.  The place is called A Touch of Yogurt, and their fro-yo is yummy to the tummy. They are pretty generous with their servings, and the toppings you choose to include in your fro-yo. And then when I did some diggin' about fro-yos, I found out fro-yo can: 1. Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at "overcome lactose intolerance..." that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing. But no matter what flavors they have available, I am sure that you will find one so satisfying.   So Fridays, I've officially declared Yvette's Fro-Yo Fridays. I order my "small," sit on one of the outdoor tables, and stare at politicians, lawyers, bums, construction workers, delivery people, while enjoying a mouth-watering serving of fro-yo.   Hey feel free to join me every Friday for FRO-YO Fridays around 12:30-ish. Oh but not this Friday I'm in San Francisco. So just for this week...FRO-YO THURSDAY!  Anyway...I give it 4 stars...because, let's face it...it might be yummy, but it still ain't ice cream!~cranberry frozen yogurt coffee frozen yogurt milk ice cream! ~4
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~DY5ovq0XqKE3R8jDfC3B9A~This is such a great downtown business!  The owners make you feel welcome and remember your name and your preferences.  They even get peanut butter yogurt samples ready when they see our dog walking up - now that is great service!~peanut butter ~5
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~KyDOluyHbfJjwMnLU3D6FA~This cute little shop in the heart of downtown Phoenix is the place to go for amazing frozen yogurt! I've been a customer for years and always have had great service and even better yogurt. Would highly recommend.~frozen yogurt! ~5
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~Yngc2rjrtZim1JM0xuD8cQ~Pretty good yogurt.  Its downtown so its a little big pricey but overall I would say its a good place to get dessert or a treat during your busy day.  They update a new flavor pretty regularly.  Today I had the carrot cake.  What I like about them is they put the toppings in the middle and on top.  So you don't get gipped! Like some other places.  They also have smoothes and yogurt to go.   The place is very clean, the people are nice and dessert is good.  Stop in for a treat!~carrot cake. ~3
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~4mwR9eKcGdg5rDZ-CkwVtw~Best frozen yogurt in town!  Owners are always super nice.   They have a kids size that is the perfect amount.~frozen yogurt ~5
6BjIGgxIkCks3NTpkj3fAw~zM-I4rDe3HwmHPPRL1kqaw~Such a Sweet Little spot - the two folks who helped us were wonderful to offer several flavors and make suggestions. Which is great because I'm indecisive. They put toppings on for you- and they put them in the middle, which I like. And although they have huge cups, you don't have to have only that, which is nice. Had a delicious Hawaiian delight flavor- had strawberries, banana, pineapple, and coconut- mmmm!~banana, pineapple, ~5
3F3YM5wMr3-ieHKhxUemag~TN9YBHoIOnmA1CHEDKMTTA~Hard work is hard to do !  One of my friends has been a regular at Title Boxing Club for 6 months and finally talked my wife into going. I thought it was ridiculous that my wife would be boxing a heavy bag but whatever. She ended up going for about 3 weeks and already lost a couple pounds and was putting up quite a bit! So she dragged me into their club and I admit that I begrudgingly went.   My workouts at the YMCA were just fine i thought.  Crap was I wrong.   I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Casey, on site.  Man is he a motivated fellow.   You have to buy wraps (they are needed, trust me) for $8.  I ended up owning about 5 pair now!  I used the borrow gloves; and have my own pair now. (On the second pair as we speak).  The first workout nearly killed me in the just the warmup.  I was literally dripping sweat.  I had no idea how to box but the instructor took the time to show me the jabs, crosses, hooks...took me a while to get up to speed.  You were allowed to modify as needed.  I broke my ankle years ago and built up scar tissue and pain prohibited me from doing much of anything.  I've since broken through all that scar tissue and can sprawl, mountain climb, and jump rope like a champ.  The owner, Casey, personally motivates his members and seems to know all of them by name.   I've gone many times, and visited clubs in different cities, and I go as often as I can...5-6 times per week.  I have my favorite instructors and enjoy the interaction and time with them.  My wife was lost dress sizes and pounds and we've brought many friends with us to this club.  Personally I've lost pants size, pounds, and gained shoulders and chest muscles and abs; finally.  It's a great time, great workout and well worth my time.  This club is ALWAYS clean, smells nice, lots of stock, and a low turnover of trainers.  This place has become a second home to me while the YMCA has remained a distant memory.  Give it a try, first shot is free.  This is premium club; not a gym.  1000 calories does not leave you easily, but they manage to get it out of you.   It's not cheap but considering the alternative, it's the same cost as going out to dinner twice a month, except you end up a healthier person in the end.~wraps ( ~5
-N94ldMGlQw_SHdfm2pi_A~rlDDpFj7K8Mcl1DAviJH4Q~Really and truly, I want to like this place. If for no other reason than the fact that it's 100 feet away from my front door, I'd really prefer to enjoy the food at Kayla's. And yet, the strict journalistic integrity demanded by Yelp requires that I must be honest with myself and with you, dear reader. Kayla's is not worth the 100 foot journey.   I've given them several chances, and not once have I been anywhere approaching impressed. Thrice I've gone for breakfast and their home fries are consistently dry and tasteless. Even worse, the potato pancakes are, I suspect, mashed potatoes mixed with actual pancake batter. There is not enough ketchup in the world.   I went once for lunch as I could not in good conscience condemn them having only been there for breakfast. I ordered a tuna sandwich. They were out of tuna. I ordered something else. They were out of that. The next attempt? Out of that too. Now in Kayla's defense, the server explained to me that they had just donated a bunch of food to workers at a local non-profit. Alright, I can get behind that, no hard feelings. But the lunch I did end up with was lackluster.  If you go for lunch, don't expect anything better than you'd get at any standard diner. But a diner that's bad at breakfast? That cannot possibly merit more than 2 stars.~home fries ~2
-N94ldMGlQw_SHdfm2pi_A~7rDmx9FBvsCA5EA6W_0lfw~This place is not called Kayla's anymore, it's called Milvale Diner for some reason. When we got there it was only one guy at work (the owner I assume), he took the order and made the food, he seemed pretty stressed out. But he was nice and considering we were a party of 7, he worked hard, kudos for the effort. The food was tasty, some of it looked a little microwaved and it was prepared suspiciously quickly, but it was pretty good. The homemade chips were awesome.~chips ~3
-N94ldMGlQw_SHdfm2pi_A~2RxKh4Rv6Q4emEHIVPErcw~Everything about Kayla's rules, from the friendly service to the food. I loved my tender, sweet, juicy Citrus Glazed Chicken, the Artichoke Dip app, and the chocolate cake. Our server recommened to me the chicken since I didn't know what I wanted and I am grateful to her for that since it was delish.   I think we'll be eating at Kayla's instead of at Mr. Smalls when we see concerts there.  Darren was beside himself and was sooo shy due to the band Behemoth eating next to us.~chicken, artichoke chocolate cake ~5
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~IWqwPPlZOXZoooBYINHqgw~Been to Dae Bak Korean Restaurant a few times before. First time was before they renovated and last time was a few weeks ago.  Overall the quality of the food was excellent. We went on a weekend lunch when it wasn't so busy, so the staff were very quick and served us right away. We ordered a soondobu, jap chae, and this fried fish dish. The soondobu was very hot, lots of ingredients, fresh, and spicy. Comparable to many other Korean restaurants I have been too. The Jap Chae wasn't overly oil and had lots of flavour. The fried fish, which I never remember the name is a staple of this place, I never tried it anywhere else (probably because I never see it on other restaurants menus), but if you love fish, this is something you should try. I've asked the owners there before about the dish and they told me it was a specialty dish and you usually can't find it in other Korean restaurants. A fair warning though, this fish does have bones and is not a fillet but some of the bones can be chewed through.  The only thing about this place is the korean videos that seem to loop weeks on end. But then again, a lot of these family owned Korean restaurants share the same videos. I wonder if they are hooked up to 1 central server to Airplay these videos. Either which way, I'm all about the service and food and this place is great when it comes down to it.~fried fish fried fish, ~5
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~lZsg8KgZ9EQXki3Wx0faEA~It was my first time at DaeBak last night and my overall impression of the evening was a solid great!! I am a fan and would definitely return! As far as Korean food goes, they had all the standard offerings of pork bone soup, kalbi, etc. and the much-anticipated and loved accompaniment of side dishes! the side dishes were good but of standard fair! the dishes that we tried (beef stir fry placed in lettuce wraps, deep fried sweet and spicy chicken, and chicken ribs and cabbage) were - for the most part - delicious and of heafy proportions!   i quite enjoyed what we ordered - the chicken ribs (which translated means dark meat) and cabbage! a melange of cabbage, half cooked chicken morsels, sweet potato and onions (?) are served in a big flat pan over a portable gas burner - so it required a little bit of eater participation! they get the process going by turning on the burner and giving it a little stir, then they intermittently come back to stir it around and scrap the bottom of the pan where the sauce and meat/veg caramelize. what you're left with is a hot bowl of goodness that hits all the notes of sweet, spicy and savoury. we actually figured out what to order by covertly staring at (and eventually asking) the family beside us what they were eating. the aroma, the hot sizzling sounds and the overall appearance of what was going on at their table led us to overcome our chinese politeness to ask.   the other dish that resonated with me was the deep fried sweet and spicy chicken. our dining mates had it and at our next visit, *i* too will have it! it was delicious! maybe because i haven't had korean chicken in a while or possibly because it was simultaneously crispy + saucy, spicy + sweet (a favored flavour combo of mine), and light + toothsome. i don't know how this dish could possess so many opposing qualities but it did. i think it was battered in rice flour? or just something other than your regular cornstarch because it was a little "stickier" in texture - which i liked - so after your initial crunch down into the crispy exterior, your teeth meet a little resistance from the sticky-ish batter that hugs the meat and then through the tender chicken. i'm biased to sweet + spicy, so the sauce got me at first bite. i have to say, my "can i try a piece?" turned into more like 5+ pieces ... and to my shame, not of the small and dainty variety. oh and value wise, this dish was huge ... enough for dinner + lunch the next day (for 2 people).  both dishes came with the colourful purple rice - BIG PLUS in my books!   the only mediocre dish was the beef stir fry - and not worth really writing about.   overall: 4* and a big kudos to the owner for being very helpful in explaining aspects of the menu to us~pork soup, beef lettuce wraps ~4
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~OVQpZh8IcQogrK3sXRqZoQ~This is a review for lunch: 3.5 Stars = a little better than A-OK  I like the food here, even though it's not perfect. On this visit, we ordered the stir fried calamari, the bibimbap, and the spanish mackerel lunch specials. The flavour was great on all the dishes, although the fish was a bit dry. The bibimbap was served in a hot stone crock, and the rice crust was perfect, not like some other places where the stone is not hot enough to make the crust. Served with our dishes were some Korean side dishes and pickles, which were pretty good and seemed fresh.   Service was a little on the slow side. There seemed to be only one woman working the whole place. At least there was a TV with some Korean pop stars concert while we waited.~pickles, ~3
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~6ozbdkg84gx2EhDejTVaaw~Dae Bak Korean Restaurant was on my Plan Z for tonight. Our Plan A restaurant closes on Wednesday, and we randomly picked Dae Bak.  Wednesday night and this place was packed. These people know something we don't know??   Special menu selections seems interesting... but it was disappointing that nothing was available at all...My Yelp Friend ended up reluctantly picked some items from non Special menu = normal menu.  Haemul Pajeon(Seafood Pancake $12.99) - a huge pancake... I was kind of full just looking at that - not much of a taste, luckily the chili pepper dipping sauce helped to give it some kick   Galbi Jjim(Braised Beef Short Ribs $11.99) - The ribs was quite tender...but this is the first time I ever taste this dish so I have nothing to compare with  My eyes kind of lit up when our waitress start bringing us  Soju and Beers... maybe my Yelp Friend order those while I was daydreaming... No such luck!~beef ribs ribs ~2
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~3L1Hq2bTfEPs8fXH2YMmww~This is our first time coming here. There wasn't a lot of people here. We ordered the seafood hot pot and sweet and sour chicken. Overall the food was pretty average. The hotpot had some stuff in it. The chicken was pretty bland. I guess it's ok. Not bad but nothing special.~chicken. chicken ~2
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~UGvB-ndGKBUIuujF_zPVNw~The ambiance was very dinghy and depressing when we came in - it was all greyish and brown and the lighting was dim. Utensils weren't exactly clean. Service wasn't that great, the chicken that we ordered was heavily breaded (too much panko and very little chicken) and the jajangmyun that we ordered was way too salty. Will not be coming back again.~brown chicken chicken) ~1
2xorCb0z1Vok7w_vWPtzPA~70p7thsZpl3dC0KTmTKkrg~My friend and I shared the dolsot bibimbap and the tofu stew. I like how they serve purple rice, as opposed to regular white rice. The dolsot bibimbap was my favourite of the two. The beef had the right amount of sweetness, when mixed with the vegetables and rice. I would definitely visit again to try out their other dishes :)  The service was ok, we didn't get a kettle of tea until the very end, when we were pretty much done with our meal.~tofu white beef tea ~4
DA1vci3RJnQKmzPLe3uSBQ~qSx0KKmZ6sjyF25fIqylWg~What a treat! I stopped by on Saturday afternoon and couldn't believe that I have driven by this place so many times and never stopped in. I didn't catch the name of the gal at the counter, but she was so sweet and very knowledgeable. She was more than happy to let us sample the karmel korn and talked about the ice cream. We were beyond happy to purchase several bags of corn including the "Phoenix Heat." It was very hot outside, so we had to have a scoop of ice cream. I highly recommend coming here. We will definitely come back! It is so nice to have a great local business to support!~ice cream. corn ice cream. ~5
DA1vci3RJnQKmzPLe3uSBQ~187y-fr4MDsocCQpQ94urg~I drive by this place for work and finally stopped. It is clean and festive, the caramel corn is one of the best I have had, several flavors and inexpensive! Try this place in Downtown Avondale~caramel corn ~4
DA1vci3RJnQKmzPLe3uSBQ~74wPicmHjm-TW8_wedkB1w~We have enjoyed several visits and tried at least 5 different varieties of caramel corn.  Di  the owner encourages guests to sample flavors and find your own preference of options.  My dad enjoyed hand scooped ice cream cone.  Great local business, nothing compares to their self-styled tasty treats.~caramel corn. ice cream ~5

BJeHWkccQRXZKKyBcauenA~LchYHC23LnTnTgAVTRb7Og~The pizza is pretty good, but the service is a joke, and the smell of cigarettes is overwhelming.  I will get pizza again from here, but it will certainly be to go.~pizza pizza ~3

Ordered rotisserie chicken...a half chicken with seasoned waffle cut fries and Greek salad. The salad was amazing and loved the garlic sauce that came with the chicken. Highly recommend.~chicken... chicken waffle fries salad. salad garlic chicken. ~5
BJeHWkccQRXZKKyBcauenA~xHp36vsED7KwQJyNaF1Sew~To be fair, I'm rating the cold food they delivered to me on a moped. For sofa pizza, it wasn't horrible, but I will say I was starving and tried catching wild rabbit prior to the food getting to my house. I probably would have considered dumpster diving.   The jalapeño poppers were probably the best part of the meal.  I'll just leave it at that.   I will say that when I called wondering where my food was, the guy said he upgraded my 12" pizza to a 16" pizza at no extra charge. It really was 4 additional inches of disappointment.~pizza pizza pizza ~1
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~btX7y-xymBAceqaWAT8qMg~I found this place to be completely overrated.   The only other place more overrated than this was the totally LA wannabe joke that is Blowfish.  Of the sushi we had, the foie gras sushi was an absolute standout, but the rest was mediocre and really uninspiring.  The kushi katsu sampler was good, but aside that, I don't think I would challenge the parking situation or the traffic to go here.   The tastes have to drive you there.~sushi sushi ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~BHdJQc93kfJtMOHKSx6q2A~The service is very friendly, and the atmosphere is much nicer than Sushi Bento nearby. The portions are average size, and all the specials come with rice, soup, fruit, and salad, as well as complementary tea. The soup is full of tofu, onions and mushrooms, not just a watery broth. Tasty and well priced. I come here often on lunch.~sushi soup, salad, tea. soup tofu, mushrooms, ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~lP-yHS60BeVnJ_noSchubg~This is one of my favourite places in Toronto to eat sushi. Why you may ask? Simple. 1. The staff is friendly and are Japanese.  This is not your typical cheap Chinese or Korean owned Japanese restaurant where you get sketchy sushi. The service is fast, but if you wait more than a couple of minutes for your order to come they apoplogise and offer you tea (hot tea for winter and cold tea in the summer). The staff here understand how to make the diner feel welcome and number one.  2. The fish is fresh.  There is no second guessing when it comes to their food. One of my favourites is the spicy tuna roll which is actually spicy.  We usually order a 20 piece boat which is delicious.  3. The price is reasonable considering that you are paying for quality and an authentic experience.  What more could you ask for?~sushi. sushi. tea ( tea tea tuna roll ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~nsv6F9mfCk_A9D6MSW2n7g~One of the smallest sushi restaurants I have ever been to, with the simplest experiences on record.  I was waiting for my friend to show up at Cobra Nightclub; already three things I don't like.  King Street West, Nightclubs (especially Cobra), and waiting. I thought I'd pop in for a quick and inexpensive bite so that I would have energy for the debauchery which proceeded me this evening.  The restaurant is narrow, and it has five or six tables.  On the walls hung original painting which were also for sale.  Super quiet, it was only myself, and another table occupying the space.  There was light dinner jazz in the background which I would therapeutic.   Real Japanese people here btw.  I ordered a few dishes, and then my eye landed on the one thing I couldn't possibly refuse.  Foie gras sushi!  What on Earth?!  I MUST TRY IT!  I absolutely hate it when I am sat next to a couple who are in the interviewing phase of their date.  Talking about their goals in life, what they expect from a relationship in all aspects.  I tried to drown out the next table's conversation, but the jazz was too soft in this completely quiet restaurant. I wanted to kill myself...I'm pretty sure I made a facebook status update about how much the next table made me want to kill myself.  The food came at a reasonable paste, and finally when the foie gras arrived..I stared at it drooling.  The piece of foie gras was definitely generous considering the size of the rice roll.  I picked it up with my chop stick, and slowly watched it enter my mouth.  As soon as it touched my tongue, the flavours exploded into a million colourful balloons of butterfly happiness.  And for the duration of my chewing, I completely forgot that a single piece of this sushi cost me $7.00.   The other sushi were good, fresh, but hard to recall because umm....foie gras!  A light snack, the bill came out to be $60.  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???!!~sushi sushi! date. sushi sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~XZJArOOoU3PDWIcP6lCfTA~My review is based on take out food only..  ordered variety of sushi, seaweed salad and miso soup great sushi, real deal, no shortcut stuff... perfectly cooked rice(rice not suppose to be too soft like most places do)  perfectly seasoned seaweed salad and real deal miso soup i think i have a fav sushi take out place~sushi, salad miso soup sushi, salad miso soup sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~6VtL4mVxuP2fd0X_U9GLMg~I had these fantastic rolls recently at an event, and I have to say I was mighty impressed! Take out sushi is often a risky little game, but not with Toshi Sushi, all of their roles held up beautifully! Granted, they were all veggie, but still: rice remained sticky, rolls remained firm and seaweed kept that nice little crunch.   Beyond the above experience, I recently popped in for a little lunch. Freshest ebi and spicy tuna I'd had in a while, and if you're in the area and you have a hankering for some fresh Japanese, this place won't disappoint.   Ugh. Now I want sushi something desperate and it's almost midnight. Shucks.~sushi sushi, tuna sushi ~5
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~yWfhM9fY3TBzDKl965KvXA~I think this is the best Sushi place I've eaten at.  I think they use a higher grade of ingredient for everything.  Service is really friendly.~sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~HUUMIWGZ5RIu2bXEefC7JA~I ordered takeout here so it's not really a complete review. I was there on what should be a busy dinner hour, but the restaurant was empty which is not really a good sign.  I ordered the Unagi Donburi (BBQ eel on a rice bowl). The food came reasonably fast. The eel was rather dry and didn't have enough of that delicious teriyaki eel sauce to mix with your rice (it barely covered all of the eel). What made it worse is the dusting of lemongrass powder which at first made for a nice and unexpectant flavour, but was too overpowering and overbearing. The dish wasn't bad, but it wasn't good especially at this price.  For Japanese take out I would consider going to Bento Sushi just two doors away, which is more reasonably price and more suited for take out.  While waiting for my take out, I noticed that the atmosphere is very nice. Not trendy or pretensious, just a simple and comfy traditional Japanese restaurant, well sheltered from the traffic of King Street. So I could imagine having a nice dinner there. Next time I will dine here for sushi.~unagi lemongrass sushi sushi. ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~5NJcoxHpJysGEAsw7dn8Bg~Hands down, this is the best, most authentic sushi place in town. The sashimi is actually very fresh compared to other places I've been to downtown. The atmosphere is nice. It's lovely and quiet. It's one of those places you wouldn't really know of unless you just walk by it.  We ordered a sashimi set and some tempura. Though the prices are on the slightly steeper side in comparison to other sushi place, the freshness is definitely worth it. Service was great. Did not have to wait too long for anything.  It is definitely the kind of place you go to to enjoy and indulge on tasty food and not just to stuff your face with sushi~sushi tempura. sushi sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~gFEEwsm6GBsOqte8csuz0Q~Absolutely love this place (especially their chirashi!)  I can't say whether it's the best sushi in the world.  But I can definitely say it's the best sushi in the neighbourhood.  And the staff is really nice.  Japanese restaurant nice.  (it's a certain kind of nice, you know what i mean)  The price is decent.  It's not cheap, but who really looks for bargain-basement priced raw fish?~sushi sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~n5fgPb4FvdoOBJR6sLvaxA~Delicious fresh sushi. Some of the best I've had in Toronto. I'd like to take a second to point out that many people who review 'sushi.' Do not actually eat 'sushi' but just like the rolls with the crunchy tempura in them. I had a friend who went on  and on about how she loved 'sushi' and when we actually went for sushi she was all 'ew! I don't eat the raw fish stuff!'  I love raw fish. I love sushi and sashimi and anything to do with raw fish. So I know nice  sushi.   The food here is of excellent quality. They will even do a tasting menu if you call ahead and request it.  It's not the cheapest, but if you truly like sushi then you don't want cheap sushi.~sushi. sushi. sushi' tempura sushi' sushi sushi sushi. sushi sushi. ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~A84Nv5G3W-6XxJpLzUxsyQ~Don't be fooled by the exterior of this restaurant, it's truly a hidden gem. Like one of the reviewers said, the people that own this place are actually Japanese. It's a quaint mom and pop shop so don't expect anything flashy. I've been here a few times and keep returning because of the superb quality of fish and other dishes. I'm addicted to their smoked tuna sashimi! My boyfriend loves their beef teriyaki. A bonus is that the servers are are super polite and service is quick.~tuna beef ~5
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~3k7RsGqCfpDcu95guUTngA~I'd been before years ago. I was in the neighbourhood and thought I'd give Toshi another try. I got the chirashi and found it featured a seemingly generous portion of sashimi and a wide variety, too. But upon further examination, I found that the cuts were somewhat skimpy and the selection was heavy on cheaper items such as tamago and crab stick, and light on things like tuna (and salmon, which I know isn't expensive, but who doesn't love salmon?). Fish wasn't particularly fresh, either. I expect better for $30 and can get better at places like Japango, Sushi Couture and Wow Sushi, Japango being my favourite of these three.  What really bothered me was bits of chopped up pickled ginger nestled between the sushi rice and the sashimi. Likely not a problem for most, but it was for me. I hate pickled ginger and it made for painstakingly slow and not so enjoyable eating.~tuna ( salmon, salmon? sushi sushi, ginger sushi ginger ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~ystYFRCDmcLYGRG2st_axw~Have been a regular here for quite a while. As far as Toronto goes, this restaurant's sushi is as close as you'll get to sushi in Japan. It is a little bit pricier but very well worth it if you actually know sushi.  So what's the difference between your typical all-you-can-eat Chinese sushi joint and this place? Everything. The chef, the staff, the rice, the cuts, and the soy sauce.  The rice is cooked properly. They use the right kind of rice. They season it with rice wine vinegar, sugar and salt. That right there is a considerable difference from the all-you-can-eat 'sushi restaurants' where they can't even get the rice right.  All I can say is that the sushi here is well balanced and authentic. That alone has kept me coming back,~sushi sushi sushi. sushi soy sauce. sushi sushi ~4
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~GUiQb9sleGGZYTRmOt5TeA~I went there for lunch last week. Average sushi at an above average price reduced it from 3 stars to 2. The lunch portion of sashimi wasn't as much as I thought it would be for the price. Fish was fresh enough, but it's sashimi so it should be fresh.~sushi ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~XLVS0fQT59SQMz6VjLCSxg~Surprised at mixed reviews.  Eat sushi regularly, and this is best I've had in Toronto.  It's more expensive, but the quality is there.  Pretty unassuming/typical Japanese decor.~sushi ~5
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~LYPsCr6Gw6G5OINBhLe5fQ~I seriously think they gave me a day old bento box! The Sushi certainly wasn't fresh, the rice was stale, the tempura was soggy like it was reheated, the fruit slightly off, the portion for 16 bucks was way too small. I won't repeat.~sushi tempura ~1
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~PmVMF7hmznL2e0FnIHI7LA~Having been to Tokyo and tasted the fresh sushi and sashimi there, I can tell you it's impossible to get that same taste here in Toronto - Vancouver, possibly, but not here in Toronto.  Here's what I can tell you: 1) This is the closest thing to Japanese sushi you'll get in Toronto at a relatively reasonable price.  REASONABLE PRICE - that's the catch phrase here. 2) Some who do not know quality Sushi may complain it's too expensive, but that's because they are comparing this place to Chinese run joints like Sushi on Queen, Sushi Time, etc.  This place has a Japanese sushi chef so to view this place with proper perspective, compare it to other joints that have Japanese sushi chefs.  Consider the costs at Hiro, Ematei and Nami.  All of a sudden the price isn't that unreasonable. 3) When I give this place a 5 star rating, I do so considering the PRICE.   4) Do not ever order anything from the kitchen without consulting various review sites.  The kitchen chef is not talented in any way.  You come here for sushi and/or sashimi.  That's it.    What I usually get is the 20 piece sushi party plate @ $28.  When Susur was working at his restaurant, long ago, he was often seen eating here.  The place is authentic.  If you're sick and tired of Chinese or Korean run sushi restaurants that think they can make decent Sushi just because the guy behind the bar happens to be Asian and has a big knife, check this place out and do a taste test.  A Japanese sushi chef, trained in Japan, makes all the difference.~sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi sushi ~5
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~dwjfWhZQ2zM0njiD5El_9g~I'm a totally Wonderbread sushi eater so perhaps I'm judging this place on the wrong parameters, but overall I wasn't impressed with my meal. Service was fast and friendly. Decor was nice. I ate:  MISO SOUP: Delicious, but I've never had a bad miso soup. The needle mushrooms were a nice touch.   CUCUMBER AVACADO ROLL: Fine; it's hard to screw up this dish!  VEGETABLE TEMPURA: Bad. I mean, still totally edible and satisfying--it is deep fried after all--but it was worse than any other vegetable tempura I've had. The different tastes of the vegetables couldn't be detected; it was totally bland. Additionally, the mushrooms and eggplant were dry, tough and chewy.~sushi miso soup: miso soup. mushrooms cucumber tempura: tempura mushrooms ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~zlE-6pWmMcVJ803dTygaaw~The sushi was so good but why did I get food poisoning?!? Been vomiting for 5 hours now. It might have been the yakitori because I don't think the avocado roll made me sick.   Wish my review of this place was better, the staff was so nice.~sushi avocado ~1
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~ug_7Y0C0dytl9hvOf6BppA~Unfortunately standards have really slipped at Toshi and I fear the King West spicy salmon roll crowd has won out. It's a real shame. Mori san has the skill to be a top sushi chef and the location is excellent. They're in need of a reinvigoration of energy.~salmon sushi ~2
DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA~fvclnHRzgEdD9sO-HoRdAQ~I've only ever done vegetarian takeout, so this is definitely not the most relevant review for those hardcore sushi fans, but for those vegetarians out there who love sushi, this is an amazing spot. The owners are extremely friendly and take pride in every roll. Normally, vegetarian rolls can be a bit bland, but these are packed full with flavour. Can't wait to go to the restaurant and try more of the menu!~sushi sushi, ~5

6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~fB66Nd4P-SMFIiD7urhg-A~It's easy to walk by Celadon Thai, I did it twice, but I'm happy that I finally found it. The food is truly remarkable; my parents came to visit me a few weeks ago and I'm still getting daily calls from my mother asking if I remember the Thai food. The restaurant decor is simple and elegant, its really beautiful on the inside. Overall a truly great restaurant in the Newington area.~thai, thai ~5
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~HaqDp9fzmiYSEJVNnID_0A~Celadon Thai is an excellent restaurant in Newington which offers a pleasant, stylish environment and amazing food.  Apparantly this place is famed for its sweets, including sorbets and banana fitters, but it was their savoury dishes which I was seriously impressed with.  I went for the chef's recommended green beef curry for my main and the sticky ribs for a starter.  The ribs were grilled to perfection and soaked in honey which made them really nice and sweet.  The beef in the curry was tender and had virtually no fat, whilst the sauce was creamy, spicy and full of flavour.   The food seemed to take no time to be prepared and the staff were proper friendly.  I'd come here again any day and, although it's pretty pricey, it's well worth the money.~thai banana beef ribs ribs honey beef ~5
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~vVdihXz59_CB5_6eTmVdmQ~Celadon is one of the best Thai restaurants around in Edinburgh. If you ignore the drab exterior and interior, the food is excellent. I first came here with my parent after it being recommended to me by a friend, assuring me it was the best Thai restaurant in Edinburgh by miles, and whilst not quite that good (that honour goes to Thai Orchid), it is definitely up there. The staff are quiet but pretty friendly, and are efficient without being overbearing.   The food is great, if a bit expensive. They do set menus for those watching their wallets but I always find the dishes available quite restrictive, so we went for the a la carte. The mixed starter is like most Thai places, with the standard spare ribs, spring rolls, fishcakes etc but they were all cooked exceptionally. For a main course I had Tiger prawns with asparagus, garlic and soy sauce, which was beautifully flavoured. The other dishes were all good but their seafood is definitely the speciality. The only problem is that it is expensive, the seafood dishes averaging about £13, not including rice. If your budget stretches to this (probably not if you are a student) then it is a great place to go to, but if not then there are similar places to go to for better value.~thai thai thai thai ribs, asparagus, garlic soy sauce, ~4
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~tm0tftmYvcPLtz0MtUocwQ~Really enjoyed the chicken pad thai I got here, and the server was so nice and polite as well. Only criticism is that the portion size was a bit small. But the dish was delicious and flavorful. I'd definitely come back again!~chicken thai ~4
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~_q5vm-JLkgbo78A2LOpJOw~I have to admit to being steadfastly unambitious with my menu choices for Celadon - but that's only because their Thai green curry is so good, I can never bring myself to forgo it for something else. However friends that have been more adventurous with their choices also say that the food here is great. The lovely wooden tables and candlelight create a warm atmosphere, and the staff are always friendly and helpful. The prices are mid- to above-average for Thai restaurants in Edinburgh, but they also do a pre-theatre menu that gets you a starter and a main for £13, which is quite a good deal if you're watching the purse strings.~thai thai ~4
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~o_lKJVHuLWEBhd2W1egdlw~Authentic tasty Thai food!  I've only have takeaway from Caledon, but I was very impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food.  My Tom Kha was delicious, spicy, and bursting with coconut milk goodness.  The chicken was tender, not overcooked which is rare in this soup.  The red curry I had for main was perfectly balanced, sweet, sour, and oh so spicy.  This is Thai done right.  I'll definitely be back!~thai coconut milk chicken soup. thai ~4
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~ev_-x0q1wztR1Lus9ozIHA~Seeing so many Thai restaurants with a mixture of extremely positive and negative reviews, I was a little anxious about booking anywhere. I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.  I looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: "top notch" and "entirely faultless" service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.  The menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!  I booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for £12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.   My boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything.   Thai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal...   For £30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, "flawless". I would definitely come back here to sample some of the other dishes on offer.~thai thai shrimp thai tofu. tofu thai thai salad. tofu thai banana coconut ice cream, banana coconut milk. thai ~5
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~kaTTDQHu_3b7JS1qFqmaPQ~Wow.  We came here as a fluke, simply because it was the only restaurant in the area that had a table on Friday at 7:00.  And what a happy fluke it was because WOW was that a good meal.  The service was amazing- absolutely top notch and entirely faultless.  The food... wow.  We opted for the sharing platter to start which was amazing.  The tempura was perfect - light, crunchy and not greasy.  The ribs were the star, though, loaded with meat and SO GOOD.    I had the shrimp pad thai as my main which was loaded with shrimp and had two massive shrimp butterflied on the side which were absolutely fantastic.  The Man had a duck dish which he loved.  I was too busy eating my own food to pay attention to his.    Our wine - a Californian Zinfandel- was also fantastic and at £15.95, a steal compared to restaurants we've visited lately.    We were hugely impressed and absolutely can't wait to return.~tempura ribs shrimp thai shrimp shrimp ~5
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~7EWkALyS6Icw7hkr8-1pdg~I cannot state this plainly enough: Celedon is THE best Thai place in Edinburgh. I should know, I have eaten at all of them. (No, really. I have.) The décor is elegant and the ambiance quiet and intimate. The chefs use only fresh ingredients (no pre-frozen nastiness) and there is no MSG in their dishes. The difference is obvious from the first bite of tender massman lamb, Bangkok beef, or succulent 5-spices duck, or generous Pad Thai. Honestly, after all my visits, I have never tasted anything that wasn't superb.    Also, as a displaced American foodie, I have been missing the level of service we Yanks prefer. Celedon employs (or is she the owner's wife? Hmm) the best server I have encountered in my time in the UK. Ki (I think that's how she spells it) not only is graceful, charming, and efficient, but she remembers customers' food preferences, even if it's been months between visits. If I could employ 10 Ki clones in our bar/restaurant back home, I would be a millionaire.~thai lamb, beef, thai. ~5
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~fxiOxfqsi7CF17Ro8dUfNw~I came here with my Mum when she came up to Edinburgh to visit me. She loves a good Thai and I had heard from a friend that this was one of the best in Edinburgh so suggested that we gave this place a try. I like a good spicy meal and asked the chef to make a hot chicken green curry which he had no problem in doing, my Mum had the king Prawn green curry and we both agreed that it tasted great. The decor the the Celadon is a bit plain and boring but the quality of the food more than makes up for that.  it is a bit on the pricey side however, with the King prawn green curry costing around £11. I would suggest that the best time to come in would be for lunch where you can get a 2 meal set menu for around £13.~thai hot chicken ~4
6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ~nWTBk3KozoXO4uZ0lYRG_A~Staying in town at the home of a classically trained chef.  He recommended this place, and it was fantastic.  I highly recommend the crispy fish and the five spice duck.  The coffee after dinner was outstanding and the topper to a perfect meal.  10 of 10'~coffee ~5
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~W27k0zmxXct7t70cCxeRPg~We stopped in this Applebees restaurant on the way home from a soccer game. it was getting close to dinner time and we didn't think the kids are going to make it home without dying of starvation first. So something that they have that is pretty neat are the tablets that are on the tables to which can keep the kids entertained and you can also order appetizers and desserts or it'll messenger server to head back to the table if you need something. however what they don't tell you is ask if your 8 year old child gets a hold of this miracle ordering tablet there are games on this tablet that they will start charging you if your kids play them.    I ordered a 9 ounce sirloin which was cooked well but trimmed poorly. My daughter ordered the smaller sirloin which was not very good.   the manager had to come over and remove C 99 cents charge that was a result of playing the game on the tablet. Overall the food was decent the tablets were all smeared with fingerprints so it seems that some deep cleaning needed to be done.~appetizers desserts ~3
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~w4qbqWCn-8NtiZw2vknl2w~Blugh...I hate national chains but my treat and friends made the choice... I got the shimp pasta and I know... MINE IS BETTER!!!!! Lacking flavour and stupid small portions at $12.95 NO SIDE!!!!! Another buck fifty for fries that kinda helped fill me up.... Got home and had a REAL meal... Don't waste your time...~pasta fries ~2
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~sOC_HMX_mIPVUs5WiBCWCw~Our food was kinda salty but we did like our salad and vegetables. Was to hungry to complain about the food.~salad ~4
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~4xOMk0paoJv_Yp8NAOjD5A~Great service, which counts for a lot. The food was only standard though. I asked for my steak medium and it was cooked well. They charged $5 for kids Mac and cheese that was not good.~steak mac and cheese ~3
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~L1C90AJI4Zmu6QJ8u3AOiA~I have a serious pork allergy (google it, it's a real thing) I politely explained and asked the lady on the phone to tell the cook about my allergy to make sure my food didn't touch anything with pork. I finished my order and went to hang up. She didn't hang up the phone properly and I heard her tell someone "idiot says she is allergic to pork, and to not let her precious food touch anything with pork, we don't even have pork!" When I went in to the restaurant I asked for the lady by name and still being polite explained that they do have pork on their menu. "No we don't". Ok how are bacon burgers made? Or  ribs? "Oh well I wrote a note on the order so you should be fine!" She hands me the order, and taped to the bag is the order slip. With NO note of my allergy. I asked for the manager and got a similar attitude. If I was a child with a nut allergy I feel I would have been taken seriously.~pork pork. pork, pork, pork! pork bacon burgers ribs? ~1
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~gGcPe80p_X4jNz756df-qQ~The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food is ok. My son had earned a coupon for a free kids me and drink for good grades at his elementary school, which is the only reason we decided to go there. We gave it to the waitress before we even ordered or drinks. When we got out bill, it had a full adult meal and drink on it for our son. The waitress admittedly punched in by mistake an adult hamburger meal and drink and said she will talk to her manager about changing our bill.  When we got our bill the 2nd time, all they had done was discount out bill $5.99, the equivalent of a child's kids meal. So I still ended up paying the difference of adult meal minus $5.99 plus a lemonade for $3.45. So I paid almost $8.00 for my son's "free" meal.  I will not be returning.~hamburger ~2
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~Rf7UKSA91Tcu6xSFH7pVmw~Simply put.  Go North five miles to Strongsville!  The no lemon in the water can happen.  The cold French onion soup?  Shouldn't someone brown the cheese?  Shouldn't the waitress hear you say something?  Ok trick question, chicken tortilla soup does it have tortillas in it right?! Nope. Does waitress come back? Nope.  My knife was covered in dried cheese from last person.  Left knife out for the waitress, never got another.  The "pink" burger was brown, the brown burger was black as in burnt!  I know there will be a manager stop by right?  He was sweeping, or someone in a blue shirt was.  The bartender talking on the restraurant's phone, so that's why the liquor was missing?  There are better Applebee's, hell anyplace would be better.  If steak & shake served liquor.....~lemon onion soup? brown cheese? chicken soup tortillas cheese burger brown, brown burger steak & ~1
Csj88GuxCXO-24VQraitHQ~tRvZFTk5000zSFih-bwK5Q~We had the 2 for $20.00 meals, my wife had the Pasta in a Bowl and I had the Rib Basket.  My (3) Riblets and fries were skimpy and I would not recommend but the appetizer was good and my wife like her meal.  Service was great, we had Ariel.  If not for the Ribs I would give 5 stars.~pasta fries ribs ~4

7bn0TeKgKB0dT-5HwT8Lcw~ODu9FfMS7u4gTqtegz54dg~Lucky for me this truck was outside of Goldwater Brewing. Decided on the Cajun burger and chili and both were amazing.  Chili was perfect on a chilly Arizona night ( yes they exist). Burger came with tots.  Most definitely a satisfying meal!~burger burger ~5

7bn0TeKgKB0dT-5HwT8Lcw~Rdsnnc79I-QjsD-SjzPifg~I have had many burgers in my life , but I just experienced one of the best, most perfectly prepared Burger I have ever had! The Cajun burger with its chipotle aioli, spinach,tomato and cheese took me to a place that can only compare to heaven. The Cajun is paired with complementary fries and pickle, a great value for 9 bucks! I would urge anyone to give it a try!~burgers burger burger spinach, tomato cheese fries ~5
7bn0TeKgKB0dT-5HwT8Lcw~yRH636c8bFqSpmzO6Wwvkg~This truck started coming to my work a few weeks ago.  Tried the Cajun Chicken sandwich yesterday and omg was it great.  One of the best I've ever had.  Great flavor on the chicken and fresh tomatoes and spinach to compliment.  Was super impressed.~chicken sandwich ~5
DI83q_BsvRrCcING6VkHaw~Jk9jUzt7j2-xz_OtJuobzQ~The Cleveland Cultural Gardens are one of the the most unique features of CLE.  I'm not aware of anything else like it in the country.  There are about 30 various nationalities represented in the gardens.  Each garden has been created using the trational decorations and designs of its respective nationality.  During the summer months it is not uncommon to find events like free concerts, ice cream socials, and even weddings taking place.  Particulary at the Italian Gardens, and their beutifully recreated piazza.  This is a wonderful place to stroll through and soak up some of the diversity that CLE has to offer.~ice cream ~5
01j738N-D0eXnZ_w8sFqIg~07A2Juc1eJ2eAndmXHM3ow~Popped in quickly to literally grab milk and bread. Easy, pleasy. Everything was where it's supposed to be, it was well stocked, clean and easy to purchase. I would say "I wish all HT's were like this," but they are.~milk ~4
01j738N-D0eXnZ_w8sFqIg~L8VqoBC660NFg5HuSgSU5A~Having never been to a Harris Teeter before moving to NC, I was hoping to a fine alternative to Publix. Alas, it is a clone with a more down homey name. Over priced and full of itself. The only saving grace is the cashier Mary. The few times I have shopped here I always seem to get her. Let me tell you brother it was worth it. In between incoherent mumbling conversations with herself, and the inability to scan items with any sort of competence, she is a dream. She is the sole reason that I will return to this location...well that and maybe some milk if I run out, or bread....possibly beer, but there is always Total wine for that........sigh.~milk ~2
AnDhBd6fqeD1QRWhgDA83A~ZxbURUNljIIHzWu81mMmOg~Eh.  It was okay.  I suppose.  Our waitress was overly helpful and kinda in your face nosey, which I really, really don't like.  My food was good enough.  I got the grilled chicken breast sandwich with onion rings (really thick but pretty tasty)My sister got the white pizza and was very pleased with it and said she'd get it again.  Our overall impression on our first trip To Frankie and Louie's on a Sunday after church, was the food was okay, the service left much to be desired and I thought the pricing was a little high for the offerings.  I might try it again if going with a group, but doubt I'd dine in again alone.~chicken sandwich onion rings ( white pizza ~3
AnDhBd6fqeD1QRWhgDA83A~41Bt5PaM9XgzCFGh_ZKe7g~Another trip last showed the friendliness of the staff at Frankie & Louie's!  The chef/owner visited the table to discuss gluten with me and offered to fix the special for me with gluten-free crab cakes, aloong with the garlic mashed potatoes and filet mignon.  What a wonderful meal!  We'll keep going back cause every meal has been very good, from the filet to the portobella mushroom meal to the seafood jambalaya!   It's hard to find gluten-free restaurants that actually care about cross-contamination, much less find one with meals of this excellence!  Thanks Chef Mark!~garlic mushroom jambalaya! ~5
AnDhBd6fqeD1QRWhgDA83A~DHF67fp77UicUnUPjng1Vw~Food quality is poor on most items and very slow! Plus staff seems resigned to it. Sweet potato fried we got were overcooked and dried out, probably left over from lunch. The burgers are just cheap frozen patties, can do better at hardees.  We given this place two chances and try can't turn table in under 2 hours and food inconsistent.~sweet potato ~2
AnDhBd6fqeD1QRWhgDA83A~oiQanbEev3CQz1Z763kaBg~Just had lunch at his place for the second time in two days. First day had the pork tenderloins and they were awesome and more of a meal than I expected.today I tried the traditional cheeseburger and it was delicious as well. The service was great. This place has only been opened for  3 mths and I will return. The only thing I would work on is the atmosphere it seemed a little quiet and I ask for some music, and they seem to have a nice sound system and they have the big screen for the UFC fights and big games. So this place is worth checking out.~pork ~4
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~cb6g0uHwAl3ELpX1fChd8Q~Went there on a Friday around 9:30.  As the posters have said, their items get sold out quickly however I was still able to make up a half dozen with one each of all that remained.  I believe it was the owner manning the counter and he is a very nice individual.  The doughnuts were very good.  Each type was enjoyable and to us we enjoyed each type similarly.  I am a huge craft beer fan and appreciated the use of beer in each doughnut.  The reason for the 3 star rating - to me it was the price.  We read the posters comments so we knew what we would be paying and we were fine with it.  When we tried each doughnut, we personally could not justify the price of $16 for 6 (or $2.67 each).  In the end, they are still doughnuts and it's very easy to finish one in a few bites and seek out a second one.  It seems a going rate at the top notch doughnut shops is around $1 per doughnut.  Paying 3x that (or $3 each) seems excessive.  Your mileage may vary and I strongly encourage you to check this place out.  The product is good, there is no doubt about that.  Will I go there again?  Yes, maybe once a year type place.~doughnuts doughnut. doughnut, doughnuts doughnut doughnut. ~3
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~OYHaVCVBlbUOcMoPnpXB7Q~Pretty excited about this incredibly inventive shop that just opened up in my favorite neighborhoods! The owners/bakers/founders are amazing; so friendly and excited about their new venture. The shop is very clean, insanely decorated (this being a good thing) and I loved ordering my Brewnuts and Rising Star coffee and just relaxing by the shopfront window.  So the Brewnut - I've heard people be concerned with the price but I don't believe it's clear on what you're getting for your $3. Each and every Brewnut is hand crafted by their inventors. Every Brewnut is evenly spread with it's ingredients to perfection. Some have poppy seeds, some bacon, pork reins, and so on and so forth. AND, they taste amazing. Like, really amazing. You've probably never had anything like it before.  I give Brewnuts 5 stars easy - they are a Cleveland based and loved establishment. And they are exactly what what a local business should be.  I highly recommend you give them a whirl!~coffee bacon, pork ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~ddvPCdDstv9vddGXE9CquA~Donuts and beer! Come and get them - if you can catch them before they're gone, that is. They have a kooky schedule and sell out quickly so you really need to check Facebook first if you are making a special trip to Tremont for them - which you should. But they are also available at Pour Coffee and Rising Star on a fairly regular basis.   Brewnuts are a break from the norm when it comes to donuts. My favs are the Boss Hog and The Bumbler, which I just had for the third or fourth time yesterday. It was packed with blueberries! The donuts are moister (sorry, I know that word makes some people cringe) than most because of the beer, but I think that's a good thing. Shelley and John are awesome folks and really have fun with their business. The donuts are more expensive than Dunkin's ($3 each) but knowing how much love goes into them, I'm alright with splurging a little bit. Can't wait to see where the business takes them - hopefully I'll be able to enjoy a pint with my Brewnut at their shop one of these days!~coffee ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~dJH0ndWDq1HbdBLr-UiWJw~Donuts made with beer?! What could go wrong? Everything, that's what... But not here. BrewNuts nailed it.  I first tried BrewNuts when they delivered donuts to Pour Cleveland. I began with a basic glazed style donut made with Dortmunder Gold frosting. It was quite good, but my real love affair started at the popup shop on Professor Ave in Tremont.  Get here fast... They sell out fast. The first day we went, they had sold out in two hours. The second day, we went right as they opened and there was a line out the door.   Luckily, we got our fill of three donuts between the two of us. We sampled the lemon with blueberry (Bumbleberry), the maple glaze with bacon, and the raspberry frosted (IPA). I'd recommend all three, but the definitive winner was the lemon with blueberry... great flavor combination and texture. Perfection.  The donuts will run you about $3 a piece, which is on the pricier side, but you pay for the quality of these ingredients. Well worth it. Go. Early.~lemon bacon, lemon ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~onWXaxXH_n44ieECPahkOA~These are a craft-beer based donut.   Per the Facebook response I received from this business; "You can find our donuts at Pour Cleveland on Euclid (it's a pretty awesome coffee shop that specializes in pour over coffees. We have donuts there M-W-F. We also have our donuts at Rising Star Coffee in Hingetown (a little neighborhood in Ohio City) - who is equally awesome. Our donuts are there T-Th-Sat."  I picked up my first box of Brewnuts donuts at Pour Cleveland. The donuts were good, and the staff seems friendly, but at $3 each they are a bit too pricey for me.~coffee coffee ~3
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~z74WT9G-uevY-N6jieAhug~If you are looking for something a little bit different, a whole lot delicious, and totally Clevelandesque, then you really should stop into Brewnuts for a donut. If there's one thing that Clevelanders know, that is beer. And not just your run-of-the mill bud light. I am talking craft beer that should be sipped and savored because the flavor is just that good. And just like I like my beers, I like these donuts. While they don't taste exactly like the beers that the batters are made out of (don't worry, I'm 99% sure these are kid friendly), you can definitely get hints of the flavor in these delicious little pastries. They have their signature flavors, like the Bernie (made from GLBC Dortmunder - similar to a glazed donut) and they usually have one or two new ones they are experimenting with. My favorite is the Boss Hog - a maple bacon donut made with some kind of bourbon nut brown ale (does it matter that I can't remember the name - it has BACON on it!).   Disclaimer - they have some weird hours and they sell out QUICKLY, so check their website or social media pages to stay up to date on the inventory levels.~pastries. maple bacon donut brown bacon date ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~ivHhgYchdqOvLi2LOnN1tA~Went opening day, got a dozen to try a bit of everything.  Check their FB page for details on the donuts, but everything we tried was amazing.  My favorite is the Boss Hog, made with Elevator Brewing Company's Angry Goat Nut Brown Ale aged in Whiskey Barrels with bacon on top.  I don't usually like maple, but the maple glaze is subtle.  The Bumbler - crafted with Fatheads Bumble Berry Honey Blueberry Ale has a lemon glaze and is sweet & tart. I'm a big fan of lemons & berries together.  The Nutty Monkey - made with Fatheads Goggle Fogger Hefe-Weizen banana donut with crushed banana chips on top is moist & crunchy.  Perfection!  It was worth getting up early & facing the opening day camera crew with our rolled-out-of-bed look.  Will definitely be back!  Go early, because they sell out quickly!~brown bacon honey lemon banana banana chips ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~WJfCi5w7XS5kOQU_whsGYg~This is probably a dumb thing to say but the name of this place is really spot on. I hadn't really thought about what it meant but these doughnuts really do have a beer flavor to them! It was different..and I didn't really enjoy the twist!   The space is really cute too! Not too much seating and no milk sold but quite awesome nonetheless! The service was great too, very friendly.~doughnuts milk ~4
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~HnVZ-qWKhxbJ7nD52AZ7kw~I must confess that I'm not much of a beer fan, but that didn't stop me from devouring my Brewnuts. Thankfully, I didn't find the beer overpowering at all! It actually provided a nice counterbalance to the sweetness of the donut, creating a more savory (But still delicious!) pastry.  The shop is cute but small, and they don't bake the donuts on site so once they're out they are OUT. Flavors also seem to change regularly. The day I was there (in May as I am slow to review) they had six options to choose from: oreo, maple bacon, glazed, raspberry, coffee, and lemon shortbread. I, of course, ordered one of everything. The donuts are a bit pricey at $3 each, but well worth the occasional splurge. Also, the gentleman behind the counter was super nice, and even opened his shop a little early when he saw that I was waiting outside. Thanks, Mr. Donut Vendor! Your wares were delicious and I hope to see you again someday!~oreo, bacon, coffee, lemon ~4
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~acecBwci_BswIuonlFkc-Q~Stopped here last week when they opened in the afternoon. I am not a fan if donuts, or doughnuts if you don't like my nomenclature, but I love beer. So it's a small shop, with a quirky feel, but the service was friendly and fast. The Brewnuts were very good, I had the Boss Hog(Topped w bacon and made with a bourbon barrel beer), a glazed made with Dortmunder, one made with Hoppin Frog Boris Stout and it was topped with caramel and sea salt and another made with Rising Star Coffee. I think the Rising Star was my favorite but they were all good. Price is an issue, at least for me. But you can get a half dozen for 16 so it helps a bit. Marc Bona was there from the paper writing a story. In the story, he mentioned the shop eventually turning into a beer and bakery thing. That would be a winner. Will probably return.~doughnuts bacon caramel coffee. ~4
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~h__Eiv8QTLpd-k-7s5GLBw~I am absolutely NOT a doughnut person.  Not at all.  They're too sweet. They taste like nothing. And they leave me feeling like I ate lead.  Not Brewnuts.  I am pretty sure that these little bites of bliss are created by unicorns out of magic and beer. They're fluffy, they're flavorful, and they leaving me wanting another one.  I love that the donut itself is not sweet, just flavorful.  Yeasty and fluffy with a touch of beer taste, just enough to make it oh-so-delicious without making it taste less like a doughnut than a drink. The glazes add another layer of flavor and just enough sweetness to make it decadent.    Go eat a bunch of these and share them with your friends, neighbors, and relatives. They will change the way you see doughnuts forever.~doughnut doughnut doughnuts ~5
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~coH6yqupWHhY8dkYZBlZ4A~My opinion of Brewnuts is spot-on with other reviewers:  Excellent donuts (the best!); excellent service (above and beyond, so friendly); but excessively high prices.  I really don't like donuts, but since I do love craft beer and also love Cleveland/Tremont, I was excited to try this place out.  These donuts are unlike anything else; I never would have guessed how well beer can amp up a donut!  They are so much more sophisticated than your average dunkin; with depth and flavor that goes far beyond bland dough coated in sugar.  There is also something to be said for the awesome owners, who truly love their customers and the City of Cleveland; they are the type of people that you just want to succeed.  On the flip side; I'll never bring these donuts in for the office because I can't afford it.  Even on a special occasion ordeal, I'd never order Brewnuts in bulk over my favorite cupcakes or cannolis, which happen to be less expensive and even more tasty (in my opinion).~cupcakes ~4
50vVs0Mtrt1AYt74cEKLDA~DWNLWbKClxYIXGrG5rSYjA~What can I say, Craft Beer+Doughnuts.  Veritably, that's all any review of Brewnuts needs to say.  Any emotion related to this amazing venture is summed up by connotation of that math right there (because the only math you need is doughnut math, let's be real.).         However, the conceptt could have gone horribly wrong, like it would perhaps be if I tried to do so.  But in the skillful hands of the owners/bakers/awesome people, the concept is executed perfectly. Every single 'brewnut' I've had here has been absolutely fantastically delicious.  A plus is that they have some staples but consistently create new concoctions on a daily basis, which is a pleasant surprise.     The brewnuts you'll get here are some of the best doughnuts you could find and full of artfully crafted flavor.  My only negative, which is an important piece of advice in itself, is that they usually run out fairly early in the morning so get there early if you want to grab a dozen for the day.  And trust me, waking up early for a drive to Tremont for these is very much worth it.~doughnut doughnuts ~5

Never found another stylist that does my hair as well as Tonya does.  Every trip home to see my family in Champaign, I schedule an appointment with Tonya.

I got a notification that another order shipped, 10 days later inexplicably. I did NOT ORDER this second transaction and was charged $38 by debit withdraw. I did not authorize this transaction and now I fear they are just randomly placing orders on my card.  I called them to try and straighten this out,  and I got an off shore rep.

I was excited because I remember eating these years ago and really liking their sugar cookie cutouts.    How sad when I ordered some cookies from the case and they pulled them from another location and gave them to me individually wrapped.  These are not made fresh in the store.  The ingredient list reads like an encyclopedia.  Not good.  I am giving two stars because the shop is well branded and the workers were very nice.  Skip this place and seek out another shop/kiosk in the mall that offers fresh baked cookies.~cookies cookies cookies. ~2
ArscDFBm2tjblsuzO3F27A~eY3H3R_KsdFRq08PcKapSw~Horrible customer service.  They did not include a Holiday Greeting with one of 19 cookie gifts.  (hoe embarrassing to ask  a recipient if they receive a gift!)  So I called and asked they would send a small box of cookies with an apology note...you would have thought I asked them for a full refund.  So because they are too cheap and narrow minded they lost a customer.  Do not do business with them.  You cannot trust their systems and they do not to rectify their errors to save a customer.~cookies ~1

205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg~09jyGdYcf6ykBM1On_Y2cA~Le Rossignol is a small and intimate bistro newly opened in Leslieville (taking over Pop Bistro's space). And on a cold wintry night, there's nothing more satisfying than classic French cuisine to fuel and fortify a body against the chill.  Or if you're me, be a glutton and not be able to focus on anything else but a couch on which to play beached-whale during the entire trip home. I tried to solo this meal and perhaps that was not a good call. But I digress! Let's talk about the food.  After I settle in at my table, an amuse comes out from the kitchen - a butternut soup with coconut foam. The scent of five-spice wafts up from the hot ceramic shot-glass and it is a delicious way to warm up. Quite nice.  A hot bowl of French onion soup is up next - not too salty, really nice flavour, and islands of floating toasted crisps tangled in a mess of melted cheese. It's a hefty portion of soup, good for sharing. Of course, I ate it all by myself.  The kitchen clearly thought I didn't have enough to eat this evening (I had two - yes two - mains still yet to come), so a small quenelle of a duck terrine on a crisp gets placed in front of me. Meaty and a little vinegary, this mouthful was a nice way to perk up the taste buds again. A nice and unexpected treat.  I couldn't resist and got the house-made pasta of the night: Linguine with pulled boar, mushrooms, and laced with truffle oil. There was mention of tomatoes, but it was a fairly light note. Rich and delicious, this was a deceptively large portion of pasta due to the plate being more bowl-like than you'd think. Very filling and worth a try if they still have it on the menu.  By now I was pretty full. And what's next? Cassoulet. It landed on the table and this plate of beans, half a sausage, and two confit duck legs mocked me. The peanut gallery of lardons laughed. I tried valiantly, but I got through half a leg, a slice of sausage, and a few spoonfuls of beans before I called it quits.  The waitress enquires if I want dessert? I'm stuffed, but of course!  I opted for a pot de crème trio (it's small, right?) in mango, berry, and apple (in order of preference). The mango was light and delicious and not as mangoey as it could have been. Better that way, I think. The berry (cassis, I think), in contrast, was quite strong and worked well. The texture was a bit off though. I'd have opted to pass on the apple in the end.  A pot of loose-leaf tea (earl grey. hot.), strong and black, accompanied dessert in an effort to make more room in my stomach. It did its job, though I still felt like I was going to explode.  All in all, a promising new neighbourhood place I'd return to sometime (can't think about when right now - too full). Added bonus is the fact that real French gets bandied about between the FOH and kitchens. Adds that extra je ne sais quois to the evening.

205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg~Tej15EfU6hVWhoqFYCc3HA~Arrived for our reservation promptly and were immediately seated. The waitress gave us a complimentary glass of champagne while we perused the menu. Ordered the frisee, pate, cassoulet and roast boar chop. While we waited, the waitress placed an amuse bouche of shrimp dressed w/ a cream sauce   Frisee salad w/ lardons and poached egg: nice and yolky, an excellent salad.  Pate main served w/ toast and jam. Meaty w/o being salty and the jam added a sweet note. Lovely.  Cassoulet: It was -5C out so this dish really hit the spot. Two confit duck legs, rosemary herbed sausage and white beans slow cooked until al dente and flavorful. The duck legs might've been a little chewier than usual, but still a good, hearty, filling dish.  Roast wild boar chop: Cooked medium w/ an excellent, slightly sweet glaze, mashed potatoes, baby carrots and crunchy broccolini. The flavors and textures were wonderful, an excellent dish.  Chocolate cake: deep, chocolatey flavor, with just enough sweetness to allow you to enjoy the chocolatey taste w/o being sugary, sickly sweet.  Pear poached in wine and honey, served w/ vanilla creme in phyllo. Man, this dessert was amazing. I'll definitely get this again.  It's not haute cuisine, but it is a French restaurant and service is appropriate and friendly.  Five stars w/ one star off for the overly confited duck. We'll definitely hit this place as the seasons change and different things come into season like ramps and fiddleheads.~shrimp salad egg: salad. sausage white potatoes, chocolate cake ~4
205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg~YAhjIAb7CdEqszfApAW2hQ~Second time visiting here and (un)fortunately, it was the same as the last - it bit better than a mediocre establishment. I also read the National Post's (http://tinyurl.com/4htvoet) review the day after visiting and although it was a little bit harsher than I would have said it, it was on the money.   A bit of confusion finding our reservation at first, but once done we were warmly shown to our table. The wine list was a little overpriced ($14/glass for middle of the road) for what it had on it, but of the two glasses that I tried, they were nice accompaniments to what I ate.   I started with the quintessential escargots and my wife had soup of the day - creme of pear and parsnip. The escargots were excellent. Plump and nestled nicely in butter and Gruyere. The soup was thick and rich and thankfully wasn't overpowering in either pear or parsnip. Nice little starter.   We also shared another special of the day - a small order of rabbit rillette with crostini. A little heavy on garlic but a light dish that was rather quickly devoured.   Mains next. I had the wild boar which was...ok. I partially blame myself as when I had the mental image in my head, it wasn't the same as the pork chop that appeared in front of me. The Yukon mash and carrots were delicate and lovely to eat. The roasted garlic / jus that came with the boar didn't add too much to the taste that was just familiar. The $27 price for this plate was a tad too much as well.   Now, the moules et frites that my wife ordered were fantastic. Neither of us had ordered very many tomato-based mussel dishes (used to wine or curry/cream based) and this order was brilliant. Mussels were big fat bastards and picked up the broth flavour very well. Extra bread for dipping was definitely needed. Couldn't even finish the order. The mini-string frites were very tasty and the perfect lemon aioli dip was tip top.   The place filled quickly past 7-7:30 p.m. with every demographic possible, showing that this little placed is like by all. We planned it well time-wise, as with our table tucked in the corner near the ordering station, the place gets packed by 9.   Staff were very friendly, pleasant and timed their visits perfectly. At least one server speaking French with a multitude of tables.   Going back to the Post's article, I don't know how the reviewer ate for $80, taxes in. Our meal with 2 glasses of wine, a pastis ordered with a shared dessert was $135 before tip.~soup pear parsnip. butter soup pear parsnip. garlic pork garlic / tomato- lemon ~3
205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg~Vx7eWHxbJ9FL-DNuEXHEEg~(note: I posted this review prior to realizing that as of earlier this week, they've moved down the street with their sister restaurant, Le Canard Mort. Hopefully the intimate atmosphere of the old place remains!)  I almost hate to write a review of this place, because I don't want anyone to know about it and thus be able to keep this wonderfully intimate French restaurant all to myself and my husband. Every time we come here, it's not very crowded and we're free to make goo-goo eyes at each other over dinner without making anyone want to toss their moules frites. But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;)   Standouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin. Both items are rich, hearty, and perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I also really like the duck breast with cassoulet, which is another hearty choice. The filet and frites are also good, but nothing special.   The wine list is decent; on the small side, but well-curated. The server, a lovely Montreal woman, sets the atmosphere with her lovely French accent and welcoming (if slightly frazzled) attitude. Food comes out reasonably quickly, and I've already blathered on about the romantic, intimate atmosphere. Highly recommended.~ribs ~4
205IU_t4t0kzCfHN06fyKg~W3RdxFrnp9NXHg56dmL5AA~Food is mixed ... Elk is delicious, cassoulet is very hearty, French onion soup is pretty good, beet salad is fresh.  Service has a bit of a take it or leave it attitude - didn't like our request to decant our wine. Cozy room - meaning not a lot of room between table - but comfortable chairs. Bathrooms are rustic and excessively bright.  With attention this will become a very good neighborhood restaurant.~onion soup beet salad ~3
6YV0YEHJKjVrwTCiyCYJhQ~pMDCdh39U75rCBG_oxy98A~I am a Fashionista!  Seriously, I like boutiques and finding really cute unusual pieces of clothing,  but lets be real,  there aren't many boutiques around theses days. Plan deaux; TJ Maxx!  This TJ is located next to many other shopping options, seems a little touristy, but this could be the reason why this store always has good finds and never disappoints.  I find the cutest outfits and  shoes and even stuff for our house. I also love the packaged flavored coffees. I bought a delicious Madagascar Vanilla coffee for under 6.00 a bag.  The childrens clothing has cute outfits in designer labels but price pointed at Target prices.   I love this TJ.~coffee ~5
Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~3Yc4Zj3hb5R5cNUbOr5N4g~A nice addition to the douche district! A few blocks away from work (I REALLY like where I work), and offering very interesting tea selections, I am already hooked!   I found them by chance (and, please don't tell Yelp managers, but they do offer deals almost everyday on premium teas via a Toronto-based deal site, who doesn't love cheap  awesome tea?)  after tasting their teas at Moksha downtown. The COCOA TEA O-M-G. I bought a bag and it lasted less than a week. Perfect for the season!  I am willing to spend money on their matchas and more of the cocoa tea. It's basically cocoa shells, I suggest mixing it with a base tea, and adding some milk to get a delicious tea latte. But if you want a skinny hot cocoa, just make a tea of cocoa shells and pour some steamed milk on top, IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER THAN CARNATION, I SWEAR.   They could be better, though: they could offer more tea accessories (the basics: paper filters, tea tumblers...) and it's very small, so you will probably order tea-to-go. I hope they grow and offer more products and space for their customers, it will be awesome!~tea tea? tea tea. tea, milk tea tea milk tea tea tea- ~4

I truly love to support the small business. But unfortunately my tea was not even mediocre - it was terrible. My friend got a tea too and it was medicore.  I had the chai tea and it was just so watery. Just really not good at all. And even if I saw beyond the wateryness I don't think the flavor was there at all.   Just avoid.

Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~OlZUAYk6xu8QqJVuolBwYA~If you love tea, this place is tea nirvana. Even if you are not a big tea drinker, you will definitely find something you will go nuts for. It is also a great place for gifts. It is a small independantly-owned shop run by Dan who is a mad scientist with tea. There are a ton of different flavors from sweet, to smokey, to creamy, to nutty, to delicate and complex. You could find teas that mimic flavors of your favorite dessert or cocktail.  In addition to selling loose teas, Dan could brew you a cup to enjoy (hot or iced). Definitely try the Cacao tea. Cacao, not to be confused with Cocoa, is the raw bean which chocolate and cocoa is made from. The strong aroma is rich and chocolatety and the flavour is spicy and like bitter dark chocolate. Best of all it is caffine free so you can enjoy it at night. The apple smoked bacon tea is not as scary as it sounds -- it smells awesome.  The shop which carries about a 100 different tea flavours could be very daunting to choose which tea to try, but the wall of tea is grouped in different categories: decafinated, black, green and white teas. Dan is also good at choosing the right tea for you if you are still indecisive.  Dan works on new flavours all the time, so be sure to check in once in a while to see what he has brewing (pardon the pun).  You probably seen David's Teas everywhere, but this little shop is really cool and special, plus I like to support my independant neighborhood stores.~tea, tea tea tea. tea. apple bacon tea tea tea tea white tea ~5

(They provided a recipe as well) Now I get to make "Me Love You Oolong Time" at home!   Chatting with the owner, I learned that they do small group tea mixology classes, teaching you and your friends how to mix your own tea infused cocktails. Sounds fun, and was priced right. Definitely a more interesting team building exercise than some. I will be back next time I am in the area.~tea tea tea ~4
Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~cYq0pIiVArDLDeanYiOCiw~EDIT: This location is closed.   #1 World Iced Tea Champion -- that's what it says on their sign outside, so we had to go in and try it since it's so close to work. Apparently only one of their teas won, the Eucalyptus Grapefruit Tea, but we didn't know that before we ordered.  We walked into a tiny space with a floral aroma. We wanted the iced tea, obviously, but didn't know which one to order. The employee suggested the Sweet Mango, we took a sniff out of their many transparent containers, and decided that that's what we wanted. You wouldn't think that tea could be that aromatic, but a quick whiff proved me wrong. The aroma was very strong, in a good way. We waited about 5 minutes while our iced tea was steeping. It's about $2.change for a 20oz cup. Not a bad deal! The iced tea tasted a little watered down compared to what I was expecting, but I wasn't disappointed.  Tasty, inexpensive, and healthy. We'll come back for more.~tea grapefruit tea, tea, mango, tea tea tea ~4

Don't be afraid to ask him all your hard-hitting herbal questions!  Tops in my books: Sweet Mango on the rocks when it's hot out, steeped Roasted Almond with soy milk on cold days.

Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~41__u9kcmyOmPYlTSrOTIQ~I work next door to this place and I love it. I'm a big fan of loose leaf tea, so having this place so close is great. The owner is such a nice guy. He's very knowledgeable about his product, and that helps, since there's so many flavours to choose from. He got me onto a tea called lapacho when I had a cold, and it's become a new favorite. This place has top-notch customer service and product, and deserves a 5 star rating. I highly recommend visiting if you're in the neighbourhood.~tea, tea ~5
Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~zg8kiy719EmA2cHwxL3drg~I'm really digging this tea shop. I'm not in the area as often as I'd like to be, but when I am, I usually stop in for a cup of tea. It's a tiny space, but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends. I didn't think the selection was really that small, but I think it's a sign of quality. Kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than I "here is every single wine we could buy ever" list.  Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.  They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever. I like that the cacao is from Chocosol, and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic, while still being light.  I'm going to have to look into some of their tea mixology classes!~tea tea. tea tea tea tea) tea tea tea ~4
Q-lz4ZAYDGk0kE-P2Hncsg~ovGJd3NHNQ8MdxSS7ArqIQ~I was on a tea hunt with a friend, this was recommended by Yelp so I made an effort to find this place!  In fact it's on Adelaide Street, go west from Spadina. it's not exactly close to the intersection, you can't see it until you're walking west on Adelaide.  This is a very small place -even its door was so small. You would only notice this tea shop when you find its shop sign (or if you already know of its location).  When we entered, they looked at us blankly because they were expecting someone else. I don't think they were expecting customers that day, they were holding an event to promote their new online tea subscription service (pretty cool right?)  Anyways, so the guy who helped us find the right teas was wonderful. He was patient especially in waiting for this indecisive duo to find the right teas.   THE TEA SHOP INFO: - super small shop - very few selections. Still they have green, black, oolong, white, and roiboos - minimum amount is 50g per tea - $2 sample teas!!!!! ANY tea, comes in a cute test tube. Just $2. Pretty awesome.  The $2 tea sample is honestly the BEST thing ever. The test tube can fit enough leaves for about 2-3 cups of tea, and it's so cute. Totally fun as gifts.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are too few selections of teas, and I didn't like most of the teas to be honest. Most of their teas have strong smelling ingredients such as cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and especially the dessert teas (like the Tiramisu).  I personally prefer fruity, flowery, and teas that have less strong (and less contrasting) smells. The fruity teas I buy do not have any sort of "accent" smell.  Still, please please check this place out if you're a tea lover. Try those $2 tea samples!~tea tea tea tea white, tea - tea, tea tea, tea tea ~4
EHGKrUgGpxYpfs4N3paJ1w~tv0tVMoqG05w3EFeZcJu-Q~So I have a theory. The architects at the Westin really wanted to build an obstacle course as part of the hotel. And so they did. But then they couldn't figure out how to market it. So they decided to turn that obstacle course into a restaurant instead, and they called it the Penn City Grill.  Now, the food isn't too bad, and the sushi is decent. But the service is so slow and so inefficient at the Penn City Grill, that it's almost comical to watch the waitstaff run back and forth, without any rhyme or reason, because anything you ask for -- menu, silverware, napkins, check -- requires at minimum two laps around the obstacle course.  So eventually, I stopped expecting the waitstaff to come around, and just enjoyed the show. Never mind that the restaurant is at most 25% full. Stuff just takes that long.  Bravo, Penn City Grill! If that's the goal you were aiming for, you certainly succeeded.~sushi ~2

F9d_0hkJodk_mjcVmfuKrg~Az7L8PABHB7eBqCtaI4wwA~I ride by the Redpath factory every day. Twice. One day i noticed a little wee sign saying "Musuem". Hmm... museum you say? I'm curious. A museum about sugar?  My friend and I were both curious and stopped in one day on our way home from work. It was a Sunday and they weren't open but they gave us the hours so we could come back when they were open.  So we returned the next day after work, parked our bikes at the bike rack out front and headed in, not really sure where we were headed.  Inside the main door is just a small security desk. The guard asked us if we had an appointment.  Nope. We told him we had come just yesterday to ask when they were open and were told we could come back today. The flyer he gave us with the hours said they'd be open and didn't say anything about needing an appointment.  After a phone call and a few minutes of confusion, we were escorted to the back of the building and told to walk towards a guy wearing a white lab coat at the back of the property. He stood back there with a wide stance and his arms crossed in a strange intimidating way. But when we got up close, he was just an odd white hairded, mutton-chopped older man with a fun British accent. He showed us into the Museum and told us that he was just finishing up with a group of seniors (weird?) and then we would have the place to ourselves.  The displays were really nicely put together, going over the history of John Redpath and how he came to Canada and first started his businesses.  Once we really got reading about him, it was pretty interesting. The strange museum man would pop in and out every once in a while to see if we had any questions. My only question was if they ever did tours of the actually factory so i could see how sugar was really made. He said they didn't do that because it's a food production factory and everything is all sealed up for health standards. Darn.  It was a strange afternoon at the Redpath Museum, but a fun little piece of Toronto (and Montreal) history.~white white ~3
F9d_0hkJodk_mjcVmfuKrg~x7TrdRg-ozheHntAom8O7g~While I was being yelled at by the white haired bloke w/ wiry mutton chops about the dangers of walking through the parking lot and how we had to walk hand-in-hand with a partner and also the rules of the place due to federal food regulations, I was like Geez, please!  My joke to our group (we had arranged for this tour midweek): For someone who works in a sugar factory, he sure isn't sweet.  har har!  Mutton Chops didn't bother to say hello. Our group, 7 parents and 11 home schooled kids ages 5 to 15 attempted a greeting when he started roaring the rules.  ooooKay!  But wait, I'm a fan?   Yeah, a fan.  Once past the formalities, the barked orders and the chastising of an elderly woman (not part of my immediate group) for eating nuts (against aforementioned food regulations!), a great time was had. Mutton Chops turned out to be a great guide, passionate about his subject and a good story teller.  Did you know that....  You can watch the sugar boat barges unload raw sugar using giant cranes? Redpath Senior had 17 children but 5 of them died? You can wear a corset and not pass out? The factory operates 7 days a week, 24 hours a day? It takes 10 hours to take raw sugar and refine it into Redpath sugar? The original Redpath family mansion in Montreal (now gone) included central heat and three indoor washrooms? Brown sugar is just white sugar with the molasses added back in?  My youngest boy, 7, said, Can you believe it-- they take the molasses out and then they *add it back in*?!!  Random bonus: the museum includes a display of "sugar art": figures from the Harry Potter series fashioned out of sugar.   Stupefy!~white brown white molasses molasses ~4

The one star rating is for the rude treatment I received from the manager/owner of this location.  Arriving home to find that one of my four sausages was half torn open (the store owner had stuffed them into the same bag as the plastic container of sauerkraut), I returned to ask for a replacement. The owner, annoyed, refused saying that he "couldn't" replace it and that I'd have to pay for a new one. When I insisted that as the owner of the store it was indeed in his power to replace it, he angrily snatched the sausage out of the bag, slammed it into the trash can, dumped a new sausage in and shoved the open bag at me growled "Es-tu content?".  Non, je ne suis /pas/ content.~sausages sausages sausage sausage ~1

Effectivement, la petite saucisserie offre une bonne sélection brassicole; plus de 150 choix de bières de microbrasseries québécoises : McAuslan, Dieu du Ciel! Simple Malt, l'Alchimiste, etc.... Encore des découvertes!... Je me suis procuré deux bière prestigieuses du brasseur Le Lion d'Or (Sherbrooke); une Ambrée d'amour, bière stimulante dans laquelle a été incorporé un mélange mystique de 4 aphrodisiaques, et La Blonde des Cantons, bière blonde de soif, très rafraîchissante...   La bière est ici en harmonie avec la cinquantaine de saucisses proposées (c'est le plus grand choix que j'aie jamais vu) derrière un vaste comptoir. Plusieurs sont sans gluten et substances laitières. Ce n'est pas un hasard, ces deux acolytes se marient parfaitement, même que le personnel n'hésitera pas à vous suggérer les meilleurs combinaisons afin de soutirer le meilleur gustatif qu'ont à offrir ces deux éléments prisés des gourmets. À vrai dire, chacune des saucisse a son complice houblonné.  Je fus surpris d'apprendre qu'une bière bien faite contient un certain nombre non-négligeable d'antioxydants ralentissant le vieillissement des tissus dermiques. C'est également une boisson riche en sels minéraux, vitamines et acides aminés. Depuis le temps que j'en bois!... C'est pas tombé dans l'oreille d'un sourd...  Leurs saucisses, d'après la dégustation gratuite, sont délicieuses. Moi qui ne suis pas friand du feta, avoue avoir adoré celle qui en était fourrée... Quelques repas sont aussi servis pour emporter.

Service though is hit or miss, depending on who is working. And the way the sausages are wrapped (put in a flimsy bag) makes me want to plan ahead and bring a Tupperware. Those Styrofoam trays from the butcher/grocery seam wasteful and unnecessary, but they have an important role.   Another reason to go in: super yummy sandwiches made on the spot. Bonus points if you eat them across the street in the park. They are made to your liking, with or without sauerkraut and pickles, mayo or mustard.~sausages sausages sandwiches pickles, ~4
2QFXPtto9n7BGv2pfnek0w~mLoqAZvrSYNVhXPeKJVzqA~It's been five days since my Montreal adventure and I'm still fantasizing about this amazing shop near the edge of Marche Jean Talon. Initially drawn in by the bacon and salamis (in hopes that we could sneak something back home to the US), my dining partner and I returned for the outstanding sausage sandwiches.  We both ended up getting swiss cheese infused sausages-- positively bubbling with mild, gooey cheese-- with mustard and pickles as a nod to a classic Cuban sandwich. Seeing everyone else order saurkraut we opted for a little of that too... and were stunned. This, friends, is one of the most perfect sandwiches I've ever eaten.  The baguette on which the toppings were served was chewy, crunchy, and hot. The saurkraut-- something I'm not normally a fan of-- was crunchy and fresh and provided a nice mildly acidic counter to the rich, fatty sausage. Solid mustard and tasty pickles.   My dining partner and I sat in silence just savoring these sandwiches.  To note-- if ordering from the food cart, pay inside first and get a number. Kudos to the friendly clerk willing to make us sandwiches even though we hadn't done this formality before stepping in line.  Anyhow, I'll be hiding in my kitchen trying to figure out how to recreate these delights.~bacon sausage sandwiches. swiss cheese ~5
2QFXPtto9n7BGv2pfnek0w~ukGwzRXDsdxnTwWZLmUezw~I like the idea of this place: sausages and microbrew. But I don't end up buying much sausage there. I don't like the sausages much. Maybe they are low-fat or something. I do like their sauerkraut. And I occasionally buy a sausage sandwich to eat across the street in the park in nice weather.~sausages sausage sausages sausage sandwich ~3
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~IFd_EmGl0pGd4brpWokGUg~I gave this four stars, and depending what you're looking for you may rate it the same. Unless you like any type of meat on your food. Blue Elephant only serves veggies. Which is fine except they didn't even have portabella or tofu. Not sure what they're going for?    Otherwise they had good food, very fresh and served quickly. The place was clean and the employees very friendly. This will make for a great lunch spot. No doubt.  Good spot to take a client for a quick meal.~tofu. ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~CdLcSVyHBnGF9rsAu6V-Xg~When this place first opened, it was a nice addition to RIDC Park - making fresh wraps, salads, and grilled cheese on their panini press. Now, their food menu has become much more limited. When I went in a month ago and again today their only food offerings were frozen Indian meals for lunch entrees and a few basic salads. While I admit the Channa Masala entree I had was tasty, the lady working told me that they buy it frozen from a bag, dump it out, and heat it up on top of rice for $8. I don't know what's happened, because this was a decent place to grab a sandwich and coffee a few years ago, and now their menu is 1/4 of the size and it's often deserted. I'm just not sure how they are able to keep their doors open, surely not with the sales of kitchy gifts. If you're looking for a lunchtime meal, skip Blue Elephant.~wraps, salads, cheese salads. sandwich coffee ~2
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~eMwSdLGz5kFWEuJe6mJrxg~I work around this area and have come to the Blue Elephant for lunch on several occasions.  The staff is friendly and the decor is modern and clean.  It's a nice and quiet place to go have an affordable meal.    I have gotten their quesadilla, the small portion, which is plenty enough and it is delicious. I thought at first that having no meat would make the quesadilla not as tasty but it is packed with flavor! If your looking for a place with good coffee and healthy food, this is the place to come!~coffee ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~4oXjkK7WXOlLlijYO1Z4BQ~What a great little lunch spot hidden in RIDC  park. This is a vegetarian cafe that serves coffee beverages and a bunch of delicious lunch options like panini sandwiches, quesadillas, soup, salad, and pizza.   I ordered the white apple cheddar panini. It was melty white cheddar, apples, onion, and mustard on a grain bread. This baby was so good! I could have eaten 10 of them!...well maybe not, but I would love the stomach capacity to do so because this sandwich was bomb! It was served with a side of chips and a pickle spear. You could get a side of fries for an up-charge.   I was there at noon and it was pretty dead. I don't know if that's the usual scene or if the bad weather was keeping people away, but I hope this place gets solid business because I'd love to see it stick around.~coffee sandwiches, quesadillas, soup, salad, pizza white apple white onion, sandwich chips fries ~5
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~JSvDfSF2XQ4jZ5v-rjh8YQ~After working in RIDC Park for almost 3 months, I finally decided to check out the Blue Elephant Cafe.  I was surprised to find out that they were actually a vegetarian, organic cafe! While I don't live by either of these culinary choices, I still found their menu to be enticing and ordered the White Cheddar Apple Medley Panini.  It was served hot within 5 minutes, and my bill came to a little over $8 for the sandwich (which came with a pickle and side of chips) and beverage.  Not bad!  The sandwich itself was delicious. A great blend of flavors, though I found it a little difficult to eat at times. When I bit into the sandwich the apple wanted to escape and either ended up slipping out of the sandwich or hanging from my teeth. Not being one to leave a fallen sandwich behind, I trudged on and made a happy plate (or joined the Clean Plate Club, depending on which reference you fancy).  I will definitely be back soon, seeing as its a short walk from my office and a healthy alternative to many other quick dining options in the area.~white apple sandwich ( chips) sandwich sandwich apple sandwich sandwich ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~FEBoWH7kC1r0ZC0-eEVvYQ~I have to admit I only come here for coffee. Not that the lunch menu does not look good, but I usually brown bag it.  This place is located on Gamma Drive. The inside is extremely clean with ample space. There are lots of seats and tables. I believe they also have some conference rooms there as well as an outdoor patio.  The food menu is a vegetarian menu. I really enjoy the coffee as it is robust and flavorful.  all the non flavored coffees are organic.~coffee. brown coffee ~4

GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~5Bb5FI-4gaKv8-uRQBNurw~I was exploring Pittsburgh last week, when I came across this hidden gem. I easily found a place in their parking lot (since it's humongous). The Cafe had two blue elephants on either side of the main entrance, which reminded me of the beautiful blue pottery artwork kings and queens used to have in their palaces centuries ago in India.   This place is very simple and elegant, and it perfect for a casual Tuesday afternoon. Their menu is completely vegetarian, and most of their menu can cater to vegans too. I ordered the cranberry panini and 3-bean chilli. My order came within 5 minutes, and it was the most delicious cranberry panini I had ever had. I was excited to see the wide variety of teas they had, and tried the ginger tea and the green tea. Both were great.   If you are in Pittsburgh, you HAVE TO visit this Cafe.~cranberry cranberry ginger tea tea. ~5
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~Y1cel-KRw1Z8wlE6qdvqBw~So I totally didn't read the reviews and discovered that this place is vegetarian while I was looking at the menu thinking "where's the meat".    I didn't miss it though.  It is a 3.5 for me.  Here's why.    First impression...what a cute cafe!  It's clean and cool with some tables and a little seating area with leather chairs.  There's also a small private room with a conference table in it.   Bathroom is clean and modern.    Then onto the ordering - it's fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor's office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we'd interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.  My lunch was served to-go.  Not sure why since she didn't ask.   The food was mixed.  The jalapeño popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalapeños.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn't order came to just over $10.    A solid lunch cafe if you work in the area, but the menu is a tad limited and the service could use some work.~brown sandwich, chips ~3
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~UYVK-HLmPzvln4HJBsb06g~I just had a wonderful panini sandwich with a group of friends at Blue Elephant Cafe. It was filled with apple slivers, delicious cheese, fresh greens, and a spicy mustard. The wonderful lunch was topped off with an extraordinarily good cup of coffee. Try out this pretty spot whenever you're in the neighborhood. You'll be glad you did.~sandwich apple cheese, greens, coffee. ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~UEH1hAkDwbDSKzzK6WGzWg~I'll start off with the food. Food is delicious, especially the Cranberry Panini. Cranberry sauce, jalapeños, arugula-spinach, onions, and Monterey Jack cheese. Yum! It's my my favorite dish there. Their other sandwiches and quesadillas are delicious.  I love the drinks they offer. There's horizon chocolate milk, coconut water, the usual sodas, propel, and many more. I've heard the coffee is absolutely amazing. I've never had it, but my friends love it.  The ambiance is nice. The inside is clean and simple, but it lacks decoration. There is free wifi and everyone there is really nice.   The only negative thing I can say about this place are the portion sizes. But since the food isn't expensive, the portion sizes makes sense.~cranberry cranberry arugula- spinach, monterey jack cheese. sandwiches quesadillas milk, coconut coffee ~5
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~JnWR26QfhoL5HNkOhdnrpw~The coffee here was delicious, full of robust flavors with very little acidity. Best coffee I've had in the area. The free wifi and clean interior were bonuses.~coffee coffee ~5

GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~6k0pCBu2koKGkqiDgC7DZw~Good coffee and a nice selection of vegetarian lunch options. This place is across the street from my building and I frequent it often. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I think the prices are a bit high.~coffee ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~pmeUTL8kQ636vwt3KpQeRQ~The sandwiches here are amazing! All vegetarian. I highly recommend this place. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the slow service.~sandwiches ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~B4TCV4vM56vPZnvIkeC9RA~Just opened, good coffee and free wifi. Radio is a little loud and space is kind of sterile, but I'm sure it will get better with time.~coffee ~4
GtkxSYxyM6XqcChFuzMjxw~4NYE0-RSyoPk5ZUTGTyShg~I use to love going here for lunch.  Recently they changed their menu and it's now very limited.   They took away my favorite panini in fact they offer no panninis now.  The wraps are inconsistent in the way they are made.  The hummus wrap barely has any hummus now.  The sandwiches use to come with chips and a pickle and now they don't come with anything, now getting much less for my money.  I use to be a regular at this restaurant and there is no longer a reason for me to return.   I am hopeful that the management changes some things back to being more customer focused.  This is a great location and there is plenty of opportunity for a profitable business if they treat their customers better.~wraps sandwiches chips ~1

OFSM1cTMfFobADhqq1WcEw~fJIJ9ziHhMFhxdEeBrVAPQ~I've been wanting to stop in this place since it opened and finally had the chance. I stopped in right after work around 5pm this is definitely not a happy hour bar but people you should give it a chance...   They have a small outdoor seating area and the bar was very nice. The drink specials were great I'm not sure if this is every Tues. but they had $3 house martini's in pineapple and strawberry, flavors, $2 Kamikaze shots, & $1 PBR's. Why people don't frequent this place for happy hour is a mystery with those kinds of specials   The friendly bartender said the place usually gets busy around 8pm...I will have to try to make out again.~pineapple ~3

You will also get an equally generous portion of guacamole, and all the ingredients that make up the carne asada fries.  Its prices are fair enough for how much food you get as well.  From what I understand, the other Roberto's locations do a better job, but this wasn't bad at all.~carne asada fries. carne asada fries. ~4
2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw~RrgLSmlzzYDncSeY2ZoVsQ~Aint nothing better than good ol' carne Asada fries!   This location is pretty ungenerous with their portions.. Unlike their other locations! When I order carne asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it. And 90% of the time when I say "No Beans", they always  give me beans!   I've only been inside once and I suggest just going thru the drive thru. So you can avoid coming out smelling like carne asada. The drive thru is pretty fast surprisingly.   There's always this homeless man at the end of the drive thru trying to wash your windows. It kind of creeps me out because he won't stop talking to you.~carne asada fries! carne asada fries carne asada. ~2
2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw~YQAp_0FJCPwTew6PoHX8XQ~This is one of the cleaner Roberto's in town.  They are very nice here and have quick service.  You may need to speak as little as possible as they do not speak much English.  They are also one of the few locations with a shrimp burrito, which is very good and always served hot!  This location has a very interesting interior and it almost seems like a converted McDonald's or something like that.  If you use the drive-thru, beware that it may take 10-20 min. for your food.  They have plenty of parking and never have a long order line.~shrimp burrito, ~5
2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw~0FehnYsAV79OYLyF9qRhng~What can I say? I love a good bean and cheese burrito and Roberto's has one that will inspire me to get out of bed in the middle of the night to get one. Lucky for me, they're open 24 hours. Not so lucky for my pants which have been feeling the stretch of this staple of my diet for some time now. I don't know what it is about this burrito-maybe they warm the tortilla in butter before filling it with tasty beans and cheese. Maybe it's the fact that they likely cook those beans in lard, which let's be honest, makes all the difference. I don't know, but if I knew I could live off of these without dropping dead of heart disease, I'd do it.   There aren't many things I order here- the enchilada plate, the bean and cheese burrito and from time to time the carne asada nachos which are a day and a half's worth of calories and sodium, but worth it. I only recommend the carne asada when it comes to nachos- the chicken just has never been good when I've had it. Nothing to ruin a delicious plate of cheese and chips like dry flavorless chicken. My favorite salsa is the green-not too spicy and packs in some great tomatillo flavor. If you go inside you can get as many little containers of salsa as you want, which brings me to my next point.   Don't get in the drive through lane unless you like to be tortured before your meal. I've made the mistake many a time of  hopping in the drive through lane because I simply didn't want to get out of my car and I regretted it every single time. It is significantly faster to park and go in because the drive through line can be a 15+ minute wait and in my experience they get the food inside the restaurant faster. I mean, I've actually pulled up at the same time as someone and have walked out with my food before the cars in front of them have received their food.  The food is consistent, the service is what you'd expect at any fast food establishment and if you avoid the drive through line I could almost guarantee a positive experience!~cheese burrito burrito- butter cheese. lard, enchilada cheese burrito carne asada nachos carne asada chicken cheese chips chicken. salsa tomatillo salsa ~3
2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw~L1gSCPNZHxNi2duwCgbOFQ~Well, when I went into this place I did not know what to expect... I walked in and holy cow this place was so not mexican food. I should have expected not authentic duh... But nope. This place is like a fast food version of taco bell hahaha, or a fast food version of Baja Fresh. I ordered a burrito the meat was the only real good part of it. The rice and beans were dull to say the most. Plenty of parking, but the place inside is clean, clean bathroom, but boring colors inside. Weird because it has a lot more of these little stands everywhere here. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break into Mexican food and then go to little mexican places after this then to the big boys.~taco bell burrito ~2

When I acknowledged it, the barista just shrugged and ignored me. Then she gave my order to someone else, when that customer realized it she gave it back to the barista who put it behind the counter. I continued to wait for my coffee while the three baristas stood there chatting and when I finally spoke up they asked what the order was. I told them and the original barista said "oh, this is yours" about the coffee she took back from the previous customer   The other barista asked if the woman had taken a sip or if she should make a new one and the barista said "Nope, it's fine. Just give it to her." And went back to chatting. As I was already late, I took it and left. Kinda wish I had waited to tip until my order was complete.~coffee coffee coffee ~2
5kA4hmzNNWGGrwvoiGnIrg~8Mdbw_I_yUaLK-W0exYsDg~Well it's closed now folks!  What a great loss to the community.  Tango Cafe was more than just a good cup of Joe. Liliana Petruy started the business shortly after she emigrated from Argentina.  As the TribLive says, "She let local artists display their work on her walls. She scheduled regular live musical performances. She gave Spanish lessons and dance instruction, including, of course, the tango."  Petruy has since moved back to Argentina.    Rick and I stopped in here a couple of times and I for one will miss the terrific flan.  Fortunately for us, there are still a few independently run coffee houses and a few locally owned chains.  Patronize those, folks.  They help keep our world from becoming a McWalBucks!~coffee ~5

Fresh, delicious cookies and such (oh, Alfajores!), tasty sandwiches on great bread and even an informative binder about the food and beverages and where they come from and why it all tastes so good.

Actually I lie because my wife was glued to her iphone trying to find a good place to stop. But I'd like to think we stumbled upon this place because this is the kind of shop that you tell you friends about. "oh so we were in Pittsburgh the other day and found this awesome Argentinean coffee house that served an extraordinary, flavorful, thick and rich hot chocolate... right accross from a Starbucks"  The flan is how all flans should be made, and has that unmistakable flavor.

5kA4hmzNNWGGrwvoiGnIrg~HAn6SAgD1FUZ3d_J57_vEw~Had some great beef empanadas here.  Probably the best I've had in the Burgh for sure.  However, don't expect them to be deep fried and super crispy, like say, what is customary in Puerto Rico (yes I know Tango is Argentinean).  Also, had the mocha latte here, and it was just OK.  Nothing fantastic and definitely not bad.  I will definitely be coming back though for some tasty empanadas!~beef ~3
5kA4hmzNNWGGrwvoiGnIrg~TQR2GfvYsC4W-1iH-EgcIg~My boyfriend and I took the day off work to enjoy the warm, sunny weather.  On the way back from washing the car, we passed the Tango Cafe and decided it was high time we got some empanadas.  They run about $2.25 each, I think.  I also got a "fruit ice" which is canned fruit blended with ice.  It took the woman a few minutes to get it all together, but I would much rather wait a few minutes than have her just grab food that's been sitting under a heat lamp!  it's cash only, so keep that in mind.  Clearly she was the owner, the only employee in the whole place.  She was quiet but friendly.  My fruit ice (I got the peach kind) was refreshing as advertised, but simple.  It literally tasted like canned peaches blended with ice, but since that's exactly what fruit ice is made of, I expected and enjoyed it.  They also offer fruit smoothies if you want something that presumably tastes fresher.  We took our snacks home, and dug in.  We got four for two of us which I think is a good snack size.  The empanadas are quite small - maybe 4-5 bites each - if you wanted lunch, you might want 4 for yourself.  We tried the beef, the sausage, the chicken, and the spinach.  All were quite good - the crust looked and tasted unquestionably homemade.  They were hot and still a little shiny from the fryer.  The beef was my favorite - well seasoned, with a hint of olive flavor.  The chicken tasted very fresh.  The spinach was nice since it added a relatively healthy snack to the mix.  All of them were very good little bites.  Please come for a snack, and support a  local business.  Sounds like the coffee and pastries are really special - we didn't try either this time - so I will no doubt be back for more!~peach smoothies beef, sausage, chicken, spinach. beef olive chicken spinach coffee pastries ~4

It is a small but cozy location and they have some very interesting groups that congregate there, including a knitting group and Spanish lessons.  This is a wonderful Argentinian family-owned cafe that everyone should try at least once.~milk ~4
AZSYZCaawGBps_tYnG8oRQ~YQx2nsVfyhIgk0xkIBbSnQ~I've been so busy, I haven't had time to review any of the things I've tried recently. GNC isn't really the most exciting thing to review, but for me it is currently a life saver!   I had gastric bypass at the end of July, and finding a protein shake and the right vitamins has been a nightmare. Everything is gross, protein shakes are thick and chalky, and nothing settles well in my stomach that was already sensitive before surgery.  I walked in confused and desperate. A salesperson jumped right in and listened to me babble during a low-blood sugar attack. They helped me find a protein that would meet all of my needs, provide me with energy, was affordable - and most importantly - wouldn't taste like some kind of rotting thing.   I was skeptical though, because they are supposed to sell overpriced supplements that you don't need, right? Well, they have never treated me that way, and I'm grateful because I am poor and hungry. Not even kidding.  I came home with my 1.33lb bag of GNC Amplified 60 protein. It's supposed to be super clean, super tasty, etc. I mixed with my almond milk, still dubious, and took a sip. It mixed beautifully without getting clumpy and chalky. Every last bit of powder was blended perfectly by my blender bottle. The flavor is totally enjoyable, and it didn't upset my stomach. The salesperson did not do me wrong.   I went back today to replace what I ran out of, and I was thrilled to find a pumpkin spice powder by the same brand. PUMPKIN SPICE PROTEIN POWDER! I am beyond thrilled with this location. They answer all of my annoying questions, they don't rush me, they encourage me to continue weight lifting, on and on. I highly recommend coming here if you have some tricky health issues that need supplements. They aren't doctors or nurses, but they do know what their products contain and which ones taste good!~almond milk, pumpkin pumpkin ~5
AZSYZCaawGBps_tYnG8oRQ~b1-fnXJpFVXjRjS_9xBSeQ~I don't frequent GNC often and when I'm there I am normally trying to get in, get a smoothie an get out,  The staff behind the registers are way to into themselves and can't even break off their own conversations to acknowledge a customer.   The smoothies are great , but the customer interaction could be better.~smoothie smoothies ~3
AZSYZCaawGBps_tYnG8oRQ~TTBj82DCwpoqjyfnPAMRLg~Oh, GNC. I can't seem to stay away!  Great store with not the greatest parking situation downtown. But they have a SMOOTHIE BAR! Helpful and friendly staff, free samples, great selection and a FREAKING SMOOTHIE BAR! Get the peanut butter surprise with the chocolate soy milk and chocolate protein powder added. Combined with a frozen banana it's crazy good and filling! And 32oz is only 325 calories. Great for lunch! Why don't all GNC locations have smoothies?!?!~smoothie smoothie peanut butter ~4
AZSYZCaawGBps_tYnG8oRQ~4A3UDjjivCoRGkjU99NPYw~Really good experience here today.   Not sure if they just opened the smoothie bar back up @ this location but I was pleased to see a nice shiny smoothie menu upon my arrival. I was a total moron looking at all the choices and took forever and a day to order, but the gal behind the counter was super helpful & patient and recommended probably the best banana pb smoothie I have ever had- with vanilla soy milk. I even got a compliment on my hairstyle for the day (it was actually clean, due to a downtown job interview!) So, I will be back.~smoothie smoothie banana smoothie milk. ~4
AZSYZCaawGBps_tYnG8oRQ~G09_FjvnLS_KvR6qz9Pd4A~Oh GNC Smoothie....you totally lost your allure.  You lost me when you closed the smoothie bar at the waterfront where I was able to get my afternoon treat when I worked down there or was shopping.  You lost me when you closed all your smoothie bars in ALL GNC shops.  Every. Single. One.   You lost me when I went to the absolute last one on god's grean earth in downtown Pittsburgh BENEATH your corporate headquarters and you made me wait for 25 minutes for my ultimate smoothie, the peaches and scream.    After 25 minutes the first sip tasted good, but not what I remembered.    I'm done witchu.  Bye!~smoothie.... smoothie smoothie smoothie, ~1
DtrTCViUn9uV8TtD_eyMQg~YWrgUFIF9d6V9QXuHQCvPg~Sidenote- I was in town for a bachelorette party ( I grew up in Cleveland)   This place gets to be a bit ridiculous. I get that things are for "personal" use... but for the ridiculous price they cost, they should work. We bought $150 worth of merchandise for a bachelorette party. One of the things was a pack of penis balloons for $9. When we opened them and tried blowing them up for a game, they wouldn't blow up, and the one or two that did either exploded or just looked like a ball, it wouldn't fill out to look like a penis. And when they blew up you could tell from all the white lines and "stars" that they were really old balloons. So my sister called them to ask if she could return them because they were defective... and the response was she could have a 25% off coupon that doesn't expire. Gee...thanks... That really solved the problem of the defective product. I could understand if I bought something personal and tried it out and didn't like it... but i bought $9 worth of balloons that ruined our game. I will never go here again for the mere fact that you don't reimburse defective products, regardless of the price.  However, I will say, the staff was very fun and made us laugh! That was the ONLY positive experience about this over priced place...~white ~1
ChK3H2ipLFK2zQBFX_CEUw~G2IZwSSpjO_i9sTIS1fjWw~I love (nearly) anything sweet so I would much rather sneak in some caramel popcorn from Kernels than to have plain ol' butter popcorn at the movie theatre. (Not that any of us would ever sneak in outside food to the movies....)   Plus, they always seem to have some sort of deal -- buy 2, get the 3rd free, or buy 1, get the 2nd at half off -- that it's just so hard to resist!   Can do the usual bag sizes, but they have a few larger options in tins (similar to the sizes found in pharmaprix during the holidays) that make good gifts/snacks at a party.   And, if you really must... You can google the company and see the nutritional information online. Surprisingly not as bad for you as you may think!~caramel popcorn butter popcorn ~4
ChK3H2ipLFK2zQBFX_CEUw~HbxUzARv3MIOrMjPRrpz5w~I'm a huge fan of popcorn so this is definitely one of my favourite snack places. They have all kinds of flavours and packages. It's a really great place.   Obviously it is expensive because it's the only place of its kind. But worth it because it's delicious!~popcorn ~5
ChK3H2ipLFK2zQBFX_CEUw~dBYkyCvokweNPRtW302tmA~This Kernels is located right in the middle of the Eaton Center food court.  I absolutely love their popcorn! It's the best I've ever tasted with the widest selection of flavors. You'll see their popcorn on display through the glass window of the stand where all the flavors are also listed. So many choices, from extra butter, cheddar cheese, white cheddar, jalapeno, ketchup, caramel... etc - If you're not sure what you want, you can always ask for a little sample!  My favorite is the white cheddar, and it's the kind of delicious cheesy flavor that I just can't put down. Whenever I'm eating a bag, I develop this automatic hand-to-mouth motion until it's nearly all gone!  Kernels popcorn seasonings can also be purchased on site or in grocery stores. One thing I'm a little confused about is the use of monosodium glutamate which is found in most of their popcorn sold in store, however the bottles you buy are labelled MSG free. Perhaps they have different recipes... For flavor and ingredient info: http://www.kernelspopcorn.com/pdf/allergen.pdf  Prices are what keep me in control and prevent me from getting a bag whenever I'm at the mall, because they're not cheap! A small bag of popcorn is around 5$ and the larger bags are close to 10$. Prices vary depending on flavor.  They have a discount if you buy 2 bags, the 3rd is free.  The other slight drawback is the fact that this Montreal location does not take part in special "flavor of the month" featured on their official Facebook page. Other locations across Canada offer new, experimental flavors like "Mac and cheese" although when I inquired about it, staff was unaware.  Still very recommended, Kernels is far superior to movie theater popcorn, store bought stuff or anything you make at home.~popcorn! popcorn butter, cheese, white jalapeno, caramel... white popcorn popcorn popcorn mac and cheese ~4
2wGXR2aHOCNJpV4pWU5Zxg~vFTio-wkwrpS96TT3gtZMQ~I gave it 1 star only because I could not give it less!!! The owner must have owned the land behind Rita's and decided to try and make some money with the land.  The worst course in the burg and we travel to all of them. You should have executive the land first! Your landscapers ( I would not higher you if this is an example of your work) too many 90 degree angle holes, not enough interesting holes. On top of that the greens follow the lay of the land instead of a proper green.  Your employee on this night could not be bothered with the customer. We pulled on the door to return the clubs and found a rope holding the door shut. He tied a rope on the trailer to keep the door locked. Your open for business but you trying to keep customers out? $5.00 not worth it absolutely no fun!!!!!! Tried it once will not be back..~greens ~1
59SEQqdtdC__k439xdxXHg~wNdL7LSSTVjkj1vgymoU3w~I just had a great experience at La Lingerie. I had spent most of my post-pubescent life buying bras that always seemed expensive at Victoria's Secret, and never being all too happy with the fit (or their gross marketing strategies).  So after passing La Lingerie many times on my bike, I made a commitment to buy myself some nice bras. The owner spent an hour with me in a one-on-one appointment to properly fit me and help me find the right bras for me. She listened to what I didn't like about my current bras. She was very friendly, approachable, and easy to work with - and rapport is especially important when you are in your underwear.  It turns out that the size VS had fitted me with was 4 inches too big around the ribs and 4 cup-sizes wrong. How does that happen?  The bras are definitely pricey, from $50-$150. I found several that look and feel great around $70-$80. That's about 1.5 times what I was paying at VS, but this was worth the splurge. As the other reviewer noted, I had to make an appointment, but there was no payment prior to the fitting when I signed up. The owner must have dropped that policy. She mentioned that she'll have some open hours coming up when an appointment won't be necessary.~ribs ~5
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~hlVIlXyGwtVXVcn570wEUQ~Great family owned breakfast place for the quality/quantity of food and price. My go to is the specialty omelettes despite the great early bird deals. Lunch sandwiches are very good especially the club. Staff is friendly. Lots of seating.~sandwiches ~5
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~Mw4knbmRnmL3zJJ90ptIuQ~The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the cook obviously knows how to cook sunny eggs properly.  The wait staff was not to enthusiastic.  The slogan is, "we reserve the right not to smile before 11am".  And, they abide by this rule.  Very few people in the place and it took forever to get offered more coffee.  I think they were more interested in chatting up friends.  Anyway, would have rated higher because the food was good; wait staff needs work. And, it was like 80 degrees on the place. Weak! And, cost more than other places.~coffee. ~3
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~9gKuPyrnSNNYBoz5VdA2nA~We had the jack broccoli omelette and the club sandwich. Pretty good club actually. The omelette was a bit overdone but the broccoli was very fresh. Diner coffee was nothing special. I think the open concept was a bit off putting. Felt like a cafeteria in Eastern Europe. Not bad if you are hungry and really want something but there are other better spots in Whitby.~broccoli sandwich. broccoli coffee ~2
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~cU-C4jcsKIt1pKqi_JA17A~Daybreak has had a makeover! It's now bright yellow and has a half wall down the middle, so it's not so open.  It still has the same great menu and same great prices. I've had a lot of items off this menu and I've never been disappointed. Portions are decent and the food is always fresh and hot. The only item on the menu that needs more are the fruit crepes. It's not quite enough on its own.   They offer 2 kinds of homefries, deep-fried or grilled...grilled is the way to go! The coffee is ok.   Service is always good, pretty consistent. We'll be back!~coffee ~4
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~B2sI8dZHbRssv65UgdsQ8w~Solid place to eat breakfast if you tell them exactly how to cook everything. For example: scrambled eggs well done, bacon crispy but not burnt, hash browns fried well but not burnt, and toast actually toasted with butter.  Actually order exactly what you expect to get. This'll ensure you get the good you want for the price you want.~bacon butter. ~3
H8Ydr14l2ZzUAuxJJR13hw~SoOAwaHnfuXcUD3O7ikljQ~I don't know which was worst, the food or the service. The Broccoli Jack Omelette was bland and tasteless, home fries were half cooked and worst Souvlaki ever! soft drinks were served in cans or plastic bottles.~broccoli home fries ~1
96JZapwKFbOc5MrXLh8E2w~vqxaxobotoRBpIpmgOXqwQ~In general this ground floor self-serve joint is barely decent. Their bagels are always stale, several of their staff are extremely slow, and their buffet table/salad bar is extremely over priced.  Their hot foods mostly taste bland.  Better options are Kitchen Table over at "The Atrium" on Bay and Dundas, or for salads next door at Sushi and Salad which has far better quality food, service and value.~salads sushi salad ~2
96JZapwKFbOc5MrXLh8E2w~aTrtzgAiO59e-5QAohW-9w~Located on the bottom floor of the court house, this little breakfast/lunch spot is convenient, if nothing else!  There's a buffet style hot lunch and salad bar, as well as a window where you can get a freshly made sandwich. Great little spot for breakfast or lunch on the go. They've also got fruit, instant oatmeal and some other healthy snacks in addition to brownies and other treats.  and they take credit cards, yay!~salad sandwich. instant ~3
96JZapwKFbOc5MrXLh8E2w~xI2mI8qMOQSL2uXCmOayXQ~Located on the main level of 393 University Ave  Its main attraction is the self serve hot and cold buffet.  You pay by the weight. Food selection varies daily. The last time I had a stew consisting of potatoes and beef and side of sweet potatoes. It tasted good and was kept warm.   They also have a sandwich bar and a self/serve coffee tea area too.   One deal I'd highlight is the muffins. They are twice the normal size and only $1.25!  Good for breakfast on the go. ;)~beef potatoes. sandwich coffee tea ~3
96JZapwKFbOc5MrXLh8E2w~JeB7aIm47V274pN7siyDcQ~Very convenient, fast quick and fresh.  At breakfast, lots of choices on the buffet - fruit, yogurt, cereal, eggs, bacon, ham, potatoes, muffins, scones, pastries, croissants... Also do cooked to order breakfast sandwiches and wraps.~bacon, potatoes, pastries, sandwiches wraps. ~5
2k38N8o_4mAVQwZrmBMPzw~WeWCzF5easalrMQtsV7v5g~Mumtaz Mahal is the kind of takeaway joint that tries to please everyone, offering a combination of curries and Indian specialities such as pakora or the super-sweet gulab jamun, as well as standard fast-food offerings such as pizza and burgers.  I guess their hope is that offering such a wide range wiil entice in anyone heading home to Leith after a night out in town, whatever they're after.  All I've tried here is their veggie samosas, and to be honest, I asked for chilli sauce on them, with the result that all I could taste was chilli sauce, leaving me unable to comment in much detail about the subtlety of flavour in the actual samosas!  But there are times when having something simple, hot and spicy can be very satisfying, and, if you're in that kind of mood, Mumtaz Mahal will provide you with what you want cheaply and quickly.~pizza burgers. ~3
2k38N8o_4mAVQwZrmBMPzw~OBAFUySpVdrnZtrd9XPJgQ~My family and I were looking for a place to get a kebab and, eager to get out of the rain, we spotted this place. I got some chicken pakora and a chicken tikka starter as my meal which was fairly average. The rest of my family got kebabs which were pretty rubbish for what you were paying. Very small, very little meat and nothing short of what you could get at the supermarket. To add insult to injury, they had asked for the kebab with nan bread but the guy behind the till did not realize that (we think his English wasn't so great). I can only say we've had better kebabs in Edinburgh for much less money. It's a shame we didn't just go for the set meals for 2 (which we only noticed half way into the meal) as that would probably have been better. A disappointing and frustrating experience sadly and I tried so hard to enjoy it.~chicken chicken ~1
9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA~leJhdsZfd6KqObra3Ybtpg~This was my first experience using movers - prior to this move I'd successfully moved to nine apartments with the help of friends and pizza parties - so I have little to compare it to.   When three friends helped me move the same amount of stuff to my last apartment, the move took 2.5 hours. With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?  The movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one.   I'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.  They didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.  The movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do.   Nothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK.   Also, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink. So think ahead on this one!  Payment by cash or cheque (tip only by cash).~pizza egg - ~3
2NVFCXfBU0NbzOn3-nRnxQ~tWiWx9fVsgFazXG0AyzCQw~Next to the Esso station, atop a little Montreal-staircase, the "herbs' ankle boot" as it is called, is a little wonderland of leaves, teas, tinctures, home-made soaps and the like. It IS really little, teeny-tiny little. You have to zigzag carefully between the pots, and jars to find what you want but chances are their friendly staff has already offered their help by now. Their selection is huge, and they usually recommend stuff I've never even heard of, but always on point. For your DIY needs, they have recipients and jars specially designed if you want to go all-natural and make your own medicine or beauty products.  If making your own tea for whatever ailment you may have doesn't tickle your fancy, you might dig their courses: they have anything from recognizing the herbs around you, to curing your pets using plants, I recently I noticed they offered "how to make your own lipbalm"!   You don't need to be sick to appreciate all the goodness they have there: they have a lovely selection of organic beauty products from Quebec including shampoo, moisturizer, scrubs, bath salts etc..  That or a simple freshly-made chai tea brew wins me over every time...~tea tea ~4
-D24iSlpY6KhaDbi_bRv9g~2o8Tqw0f8Jek0zr7F2UJFA~I am visiting Toronto for a few weeks and my long hair was starting to bother me in the summer heat so I decided to take the chance and try a barber abroad.  Overall, it was great! My only complaint was that I got a blocked nape instead of a tapered nape, but it was partially my fault for not asking, I'm just used to every barber opting for a tapered nape. I've read that blocked napes are supposed to make your neck look thicker, so Dominic (the barber) must have thought I had a chicken neck (joking)! Besides that, Dominic took off so much weight and my cut looked exactly as I wanted it and he worked with my hair the way it was. I also came on a Monday and it was convenient that it was open at that time when most barber shops are closed or have limited hours.    For $30($5 tip) it was worth it, might shop around next time though but I would not hesitate to come back here again if I had to.~chicken ~4
1jdZuhFDFiAtgZIo4WyhEg~4wHaijlWvXhCipNTIoGAtQ~Um Hamburgern und Pommes zu entgehen, ist es auch in Toronto empfehlenswert sich nach einer Alternative umzuschauen. Chinatown ist nur einen Spaziergang vom Sutton Place Hotel entfernt und bevor wir unseren Leihwagen übernehmen, wollen wir uns hier erst einmal stärken.  Etwas wuselig, wie in asiatischen Städten geht es auch hier zu. Wo kommen bloß plötzlich so viele Asiaten her?  Ein ansprechendes Chinarestaurant ist schnell gefunden. Fast ausschließlich Gäste aus den fernöstlichen Ländern sind hier anzutreffen. Ein gutes Zeichen, es ist vollbesetzt zur Mittagszeit, die Angestellten fahren mit kleinen Servierwagen zu den Tischen und bieten aus kleinen Körbchen leckere Spezialitäten an. Tee wird serviert, an den einsehbaren Küchenwänden baumeln lackierte Enten und warten darauf verzehrt zu werden. Wir probieren einmal quer Beet, es schmeckt schon zum Teil ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig, zumindest anders als bei unserem Stammchinesen in old Germany.~beet, ~4
1jdZuhFDFiAtgZIo4WyhEg~MhaERFK01AhyvB6jm0iZCw~To my mind, Toronto has one of the best China Towns of any city, in fact better than the more noted ones of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco or that of Sydney, Australia. It's easy to get around and besides just simply being nothing but Chinese, also has areas of Korean, Malaysian as well as a surprisingly large area of ethnic Portuguese enclave. So when touring the area you are easily able to explore other ethnic areas as well.  Toronto's China Town offers shopping bargains galore, all sorts of markets loaded with varying goods include some of the most exotic of fruits and vegetables and the best of what are real authentic Chinese restaurants with hardly any of them including those cheap American New York styled Chinese crap such as General Tao's Chicken. Yuck!   Better yet, the neighborhoods have greatly improved over the years, now having become rather upscale due to the relocation of many of the locals brought about by the gentrification of the former hippie areas of Yorkville or formerly impoverished areas of what is known as Cabbagetown.~chicken. ~4
9q_O836mXia6Lqkirl2Ynw~KHjqdYpxbSGsZNzBOzCmjA~Ahhhhhh LC, how I love you for so many reasons!!! The cheesy bread here is friggin amazing. It really is hit and miss for most people. You either love it or you don't.   Personally, in my opinion, you can't compare this pizza chain to any other. It's one in its own. Walk in pizzas readily available for $5-8 bucks. Obviously they won't be as good or fresh as a freshly made pizza pulled out of the oven. BUT YOU COME HERE KNOWING THIISSSSSSS!!!   The pizza crust is the perfect firmness every time and the toppings are a-ok in my books. Absolutely love the cheese bread.   Not "authentic" pizza, not always the freshest (though you can wait and order a fresh one), but when in a hurry, when hungry and when you don't feel like spending $20 on a 3 topping medium, this place is your best friend!~pizza pizza pizza cheese bread. pizza ~4
9q_O836mXia6Lqkirl2Ynw~7HdSy97VV8mHVG6iupF0Hw~Good quick pizzas!!  Always friendly staff! pizza is cooked consistently.  Can't beat the price for medium cheese pizza, and is always ready!!  Kids love it!  Lots of parking in plaza! In and out in a few minutes!! Fast!!~pizza cheese pizza ~5
9q_O836mXia6Lqkirl2Ynw~gCXlLpDjVYZJQm3uHKueZw~Tried their deep dish pizza with 3 meats for $12.99. Love the crunchy outer crust.   On the menu I did not see a chicken pizza but I know I had it at another Little Caesar location. Ask the person at the counter for a chicken pizza and she said they will make it for me. It took about 7 minutes and it was done. Cost $8.50.   Before handing me my order she threw in an a bag of cheesy bread stick on the house. That was so nice of her. Probably their strategy to get future business and it works. I will be going back again when craving pizza.~pizza chicken pizza chicken pizza pizza ~3
9q_O836mXia6Lqkirl2Ynw~haZ2s02fuIVWB8tVm9tL_A~I dont know how someone can write an entirely positive review and still give only a 3 stars. This place is amazeballs. The specials are cheaper than the elgin mills location that is closer to me. The cornmeal on the pizza bottom is soooooo guuuuuuuud. Wings are just delish, they toss it in sauce after theyre ready. The bacon honey mustard sauce is *high pitched voice* to diiiiieeee for. They are smaller wings but meat is always juicy and skin is flavourful. Marinara sauce is $1 and is a GENEROUS portion. Wait time is less than pizza pizza too. No seating, take out only.~pizza bacon honey pizza pizza ~5
9q_O836mXia6Lqkirl2Ynw~LWNBIkPWy5MseF1NaEq_Vw~I like going to this location. The staff is very friendly and they will always let me know how much time it will take for a pizza that's not ready ( I like hawaiian and it's not always ready).    It also does not take long to make them. The only inconvenient is that it can be hard to exit the plaza during rush hard.~pizza ~4
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~_qmwSIamm_pVC8STBOWtZA~This is a food truck and they are pretty popular. They are not in the same place everyday so if you ever need to find them or want to know when they will be near you follow them on face book. That's what I do :) With new daily specials you really cant go wrong here. Oh and they are the tot kings. They bring tater tots to a whole new level. Loaded tots with creme, well just heavenly. Tater tots with chez wiz, chives, bacon, and sour cream. I forgot how much I loved tater tots as a kid. Now I can experience the adult version only Chef Street Bistro can give.  So if you happen to see this food truck  suggest stopping, even if you are not fully hungry. It will be well worth it, even if you only get the adult tater tots.~bacon, sour cream. ~5

Absolutely loved the hot dog wrapped in bacon topped with pimiento cheese and grilled onions. Great idea putting it in a pretzel roll. All I can say is WOW!! The tots were amazing too!   Looking forward to meeting up again with Chef Street Bistro to try some of the other delicious looking items on the menu.~hot dog bacon cheese ~5
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~UOCzrCJ1dqIV-xltgPcYHw~This is another great food truck you need to find.  They were at Triple C Brewery last Saturday.    Previously, I  talked to Johnathan about their Cubans I figured I give it a try. I have lived in Tampa, Fl in my past and I have I never really like a Cuban sandwich until I tried Johnathan's. The pork/ham mixed in the cheese pickles and other spices made for a great tasting sandwich that I will ask for again.   This Saturday, I came a little later and they were out of Cubans, so I got a Prime Rib with Au-juice. It was awesome with the caramelized onions, mushrooms and other seasonings.  Thanks for being at Triple C!~sandwich cheese pickles sandwich mushrooms ~5
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~COKNTRqE1nNLqKVJMXYFRA~A solid 3.5 . This is really tough because I LOVED their Buffalo Tater Tots, and I wish I had an entire basket of those bad boys. They were also very friendly folks   ...but  I also tried the Prime Rib Au Jus sandwich which was suppose to have melted swiss, onions, and mushrooms but I couldn't taste or detect any of the veggies or sadly even the cheese. All I could make out was chopped meat and it was dry. The Au jus it came with was tasty and did combat the dryness a litle bit, but I was really hoping for some melty cheesy-goodness.  I would give them another shot because those tots are pretty incredible, and based on all of the great ratings maybe they just had an off-day.~sandwich swiss, mushrooms cheese. ~3
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~XYZurkOlOHNfNjpyjnzVmQ~I tried them on their first day and while they were still working the kinks out I could tell after I tasted the Prime Rib sandwich and Tots I knew that this would be a truck I'd be visiting for a long time. The food was great! The only thing I could say that wasn't was that the rolls would be a little better if they were the ones with the hard crust but the Prime Rib was incredible. Chef Street Bistro is worth the trip and the wait and while you're waiting you should check out how well the truck turned out. It's fantastic as well.~sandwich ~5
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~tGCFGBsyA6EsdtO30Ckk1Q~I had the chance to try this new food truck today at Triple C Brewery.  Love the combination of Prime Rib sandwiches and tater tots with various toppings.  The truck is really cool.  They have an awning they raise from the side of the truck so if it's bad weather you won't get wet.  Under the awning is LED lighting so you can see what you are doing also.  They even brought their own Apple wireless router.    The menu consists of various prime rib sandwiches from a a South Street Philly to a French to a classic.  Each sandwich comes with tots are your choosing, also with the similar toppings.  I ordered the Classic sandwich and French tots (I forget the exact name of them).   The tots were absolutely amazing.  They came covered in blue cheese with fried onions on top.  Best Tots in town!!!!   The sandwich was also good but the meat was cold when I sat down to eat it.  Also it was too much bread.  It would be nice if they added an option for a wrap in addition to the roll.  Overall, great idea for a food truck.  The flavors are fantastic.  I look forward to trying other options from this truck!~sandwiches apple sandwiches sandwich sandwich cheese sandwich ~4
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~Wr5A7LE_NY1FAM31B4bIRA~Ran into these guys at Triple C brewery tonight after a photograph of the Shanghai Shrimp Po'Boy captured my attention. Excellent execution of the sweet and spicy Asian sauce with a nice complement of cabbage and peanuts. The tater tots were crispy and hot.  Great service and great food!~shrimp cabbage ~5
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~_dP34kAMO2MMMQcC1D4XtA~If you like blue cheese you have to try the frenchie! It's the most heavenly sandwich on earth. Second favorite is the Oscar, kind if reminds me of dinner and dessert at the same time... Both have amazing sauces and flavor. Tater tots are to die for. Definitely top your tots!!!! Low country!!! Amazing!~cheese sandwich ~5
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~0u9w1Tp9Un-ULoSFlHGiCg~These guys were parked outside of the Triple C Brewery today. The aroma going in definitely caught my attention as did the words prime rib sandwich, buffalo chicken eggrolls and tater tots. Even though it was a real scorcher today I sucked it up and got my grub on. Apparently they change the menu now and then to keep selection fresh. I settled on the "What's up dog?"; a large hotdog wrapped in bacon, served on a pretzel bun with caramelized onions and zesty, chunky style/grainy Dijon mustard. What a combo! Went really well with a Nowhere Porter. Nice job guys!!!!!~sandwich, chicken bacon, ~4
5TyPecufGvH8cMwv2gxMxQ~TKIcfVydiQCnjjCrD_aaJQ~I went to this food truck gem a few days ago. The steak and egg was amazing. They also have some of of the best tater tots I have had in awhile.  I wish this place was a stand alone restaurant.  GREAT FOOD!~steak egg ~5

You're the proud recipient of a slightly blurry but [damn it!] clear enough candid portrait with a pricetag of $165 plus points on your license.  Unless, that is... you attend traffic school.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is how I found myself with 50+ other unfortunate drivers and a former adjunct professor/wanna be stand-up comic in a Holiday Inn conference room with a legal capacity of 35.    Having to go traffic safety school: 0 stars + the desire to re-do my drive down Rural going the speed limit. Getting to go to traffic safety school instead of getting points on your license: 5 stars. Instructor who tries his darndest to make it interesting: 5 stars.  Online registration at AZCCTS.com was easy, there were several open classes before my court date, and when I showed up they had me on their list.  The instructor genuinely tried to entertain and enlighten us with his endless supply of anecdotes, illustrations, and attempts to toss the used illustrations in the garbage can, without ever actually making a basket.  People: If you love to entertain but can't seem to find a captive audience, consider applying to teach traffic school.    I attended the course in Chandler at the Holiday Inn Express at the I-10 and Chandler Blvd.  WIth one individual bathroom for men and one for women, a broken vending machine, and serious over-crowding in the 'classroom' there is some room for improvement in terms of the accommodations.  But - isn't there always a silver lining? - when I asked the front desk about the broken vending machine, I was told I could partake of the free continental breakfast and sampled a suprisingly delicious cinnamon roll from under a heat lamp.  That s*** was good.  All in all I recommend this course to whoever needs it.  It's not so bad...~date, ~4
HIHYRrc8ous_ncIs8X_clg~Hm8BxE3W0W4FVs3HnR94wg~This place makes my favorite butter curry of any Indian restaurant I've ever visited!  I'm don't live in Montreal, but the last time I was there I even flew some of the food home in my luggage.  It's definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area.~butter ~5
HIHYRrc8ous_ncIs8X_clg~JqZj_Me8ado_HoLGDpwa4g~Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.

I promise to wholeheartedly appreciate the design of the store and all the original artwork, photography and sculpture that's displayed so marvellously!  I promise to drink tea from the gorgeous, hand-painted cups and juice from the chunky and wholesome Mexican recycled glass glasses!  I promise to bake cupcakes and tasty stews in all the pretty, and functional, ceramic dishes and bake-ware...and then serve it on plates decorated with furry animals and blossom trees!  I promise to read all the interesting books lying around whilst lounging on the comfy looking sofas and bed in the downstairs area...and I'll even put them back in the right place and straighten the gorgeous throw that I know Jen wants so much!   I promise to look after the sparkly, pretty jewellery and wonderful bags that are in the accessories section ...and wear them to the best of my abilities!

3sMcKyE8SjrU3CKgOHs_EQ~m7qQfmdp7yL42Tvw_LNkKw~When word spread that Anthropologie were opening in Edinburgh, all of my American friends (who had the pleasure of shopping there across the waters previously) told me I was going to *love* it. All of them. Individually. They actually said "Jenny, you are going to love it." They also warned me that it would cost a pretty penny.  Correct on all fronts.  It was perhaps for this reason I had totally and utterly ignored it until recently. It opened a wee while ago but I just never went out of my way to go. But now I've been in I can't help but imagining my life with more Anthropologie in it.   A beautiful quilted duvet in mist-matched Indian fabrics on my bed perhaps? With the cutest porcelain drawer-handles to replace the old ones on my desk drawers? And the delicious smell of vanilla candles to compliment the equally vanilla perfume on my dressing table? And a beauteous mug full of fresh lemon and ginger tea on the desk, sitting beside the completely unique and individual hand-made leather-bound notebook, containing all the notes for my latest upcoming novel. And beside the gorgeous cup and beautiful notebook, a mismatching (yet so mismatching it matches) china plate that I made using the most stunning yet still practical of kitchen utensils (like a pink spatula, floral bowl, hand-carved wooden spoon) spread with a layer of butter from the pottery butter jar.  You get the picture. My life with Anthropologie in it would be look better, smell better, taste better, be better (and I would be an author on the side, FYI) -in the most fabulously earthy, boho hippy chic-meets-Betty-crocker type way. It's just...me...in a store.  Sadly, my wallet and pennies do not afford me the luxury of living in a home that looks as if it just happened to all fall together like that in the most mismatching and ear-worn of ways. (That Indian-material quilted duvet? Close to £300). If you could kit your home out in Anthropologie it would look effortlessly cool. Like even cooler than Monica's apartment in Friends (cos that was so at least 10 years ago...God I'm old.)  They also have clothes. And accesories. And fashion things. An amazing hat that I wanted. And the cutest little aardvark toy. See, all pointless things I don't need but that my life now feels imcomplete without. The clothes aren't quite so *me* but the homewares...ohyes.~lemon ginger tea butter butter ~4
3sMcKyE8SjrU3CKgOHs_EQ~HFvoR4phx7XSvVvK6nBGFg~She and I, we have a strange friendship. She invites me into her home on occasion - she never comes to mine. Each time, I am quietened. For example, I will pick up a cushion, and she will casually mention its value. I'll quickly replace it, blushing. "Sorry," I say. "I'm just... it's really pretty."  She smiles - laughs actually - not a tinkling, vanishing laugh, but a proper laugh full of sparkle and fun. "It's fine," she says, with a wink. But I've put the cushion back too straight. This is not a house of straightness. As she bends to re-skew it, back to the perfect angle, just so, I notice the way her dress falls. It's elegant. It's quirky. It's colourful. Oh, for a dress like that.  The coffee table is laden with enormous books: Berlin. Photography. Seasonal Pies. Spaces... Spaces? They're beautiful, and they don't look like they've ever been opened. They are there to be on the table. The table, likewise, is there to bear their unread weight. A candle in a tin, too, wide, with three wicks, which have never been lit; a fresh, fruity aroma hovers around it all the same.  I turn to comment on the beautiful smell but she's pulling on a patchwork apron over her beautiful dress. It messes up her hair a little bit, improves it somehow. "Let's make a cake!" she laughs - that laugh again - and pulls me out into the hall by my arm, starting to make for the kitchen. I wonder vaguely if she ought not to perhaps try making one of the Seasonal Pies instead. I nearly trip over a padded fabric doorstop on my way out, a paisley and polka-dot letter "A". Ah. Her name stops doors from closing. Of course.  "I'm - I'm sorry," I stammer, un-straightening the A, checking it for a mark where I've kicked it. No. Thank goodness. "Actually, I - I have to be heading off again pretty soon." I seem in danger of knocking everything, and yet there's so much room here. Spaces.  "But you never stay!" she cries, with a playful pout. "I've got these pecans to use up, you know..."  "No, really, sorry, I know, ha. Um." I shrug. I'm trying now not to be standing on the rug. Has anyone ever stood on this rug? She probably stands slightly above it.  "Oh, spoilsport," she grins. "Ok, off you go then. See you next time, Cressida!"  "Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye, Anthropologie."  She waves to me from the door, an embroidered oven glove on her hand, as I walk out into the street, holding nothing in mine. Already I regret leaving - already I want to go back in - already I will visit her again. I turn to wave back, but the door has closed.~coffee cake! ~4
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~qPVG0uXBkkAyIpxyxRdh-w~Way better than Sweetie Peas!!  I love this place! Great service!  My favorite is the Hawaiian Sherbet!  I can't find it any other place !!~peas! ~5
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~h0XX7Ppv6CBofmn8bwcqqw~Before trying Froyona I had never had frozen yogurt before and since then I've spent a considerable amount of time mourning those lost years. This place caught my attention because I was driving by and there was a line!  You've got the standard flavors like vanilla and chocolate and then you've got flavors like root beer float, cake batter, cookies n' cream. What's really cool is that the flavors don't stay the same, almost every time I go in there are different flavors and they offer samples.   Now, let's get to the toppings! There are several different sauces to choose from like caramel, hot fudge and butterscotch. Just a few of the toppings are brownie bites, cream cheese bites, reese's pieces, m & m's, frosted animal cookies, white chocolate, dark chocolate. There must be at least thirty different topping and they are all delicious! The shop itself is really nice too with comfortable chairs, natural lighting and the staff are helpful and polite.  The ONLY reason I didn't give this place five stars is the serving sizes. There is only huge and ginormous. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that this stuff is sold by weight so they encourage you to indulge. Usually, I do, and then I kick myself for putting to much in my cup. I've gotten pretty good at keeping tabs on how much I'm putting in it but those cups fill up fast and if your not careful you will dread that scale. My total usually tallies around $12 and that's for me and my son (don't just assume it was for me...). I wish they had a smaller cup for when I want to have just a taste and I won't have to worry about packing on the pounds on either scale....~frozen yogurt cake cookies caramel, cream cheese ~4
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~TxBJU8CVEp34QQW1mZitWw~I hope they never get rid of the Yellow Cake Batter yogurt because it is heaven! This establishment is really clean and I love the presentation of their toppings. There are more toppings to choose from at Froyona than at Sweetie Peaz and Yogurt Jungle. I also like that they do the reward program and your 10th yogurt is free! You don't have to use those stupid punch cards either they use your phone number. I am now a die hard loyal pregnant fan of Froyona.~cake ~5
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~p5YeGFl8DylWDEemR1fOJQ~Really enjoy the store.  Temperature of the yogurt is colder than some of the yogurt stores I have frequented.  As I must watch my sugar intake,  I think they don't have a selection of sugar-free flavors.  I don't care for S-F  strawberry-banana, as it tastes too sweet.  Would love to see S-F cookies and cream, chocolate or tart vanilla.  Would then rate the store 5-Stars.~banana, cookies ~4
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~seH4TtZelE9DqgQ5n1kEpA~Thank you JESUS! Finally there's a place where I can score a strawberry milk tea with boba!! There's also slushies and smoothies.  Oh, and the frozen yogurts really good too.  My daughter and husband had the frozen yogurt and said it was great.  TONS of toppings too!  We used to go to Sweetie Peaz but the owner went a bit cray cray and it was uncomfortable to go there but thankfully I've found a fabulous replacement.  On my way back for another milk tea....~milk tea smoothies. frozen yogurt milk tea.... ~5

-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~1wm_5Wrk70E4ZcXcgJ7OiQ~They've recently added TONS of flavors, teas, smoothies, frozen espresso drinks, etc. Definitely worth stopping by. I wasn't too fond of them at first, but with the expansion, they're worth a visit!~smoothies, ~4
-5fK4OgKir00PiuiGUIrAg~9ux-YcD4QWjI7DCnDQmXUw~This place is now called YoBoba if I read the sign correctly.  I am super excited to have a Boba tea house by me. The boba is awesome!!!!!! Just like the place I always go to in chandler and now I don't need to make the drive.  Super excited to go back.   I did ask if the place was under new management and if is. A new owner.  He was super friendly and the place is as clean as it was before.    Boba and frozen yogurt.  Heaven!~tea frozen yogurt. ~5
-TGwtTiieh_JLml5_VRMQA~HyB1i1s4Wyu4TNdzwceDIw~You know, Starbucks gets a bit of a bad rap and I have to say that this particular Starbucks certainly does not deserve it. I was very excited when it opened just down the road from where I work. After all, the drive to coffee was pretty long.   Here they do things right. The staff is knowledgable and friendly and they make good lattés. I'm not a fan of the fancy drinks. Just give me my espresso and steamed milk. Now, the thing about such sime tastes is that when a barista messes the drink up, there's nowhere to hide. There are only two ingredients after all. I have had some pretty nasty lattés in my time, but never from here.   So, if you're far from the city and up in Oak Ridges, stop by this Starbucks for a lattè. I'm certain you will be perfectly happy...unless, of course, you don't like coffee.~coffee milk. coffee. ~3
-TGwtTiieh_JLml5_VRMQA~aM5_VgevbkbWJOUAY7x4cw~Dirty coffee mugs with coffee strains at the rim really turned me off!  I have to give credit for the Starbucks for the placement of the electric outlets. There are really 3 different sets around the stores and spread out quite nicely. The chance of getting a table near a plug is quite good!  The nice armchair in the front of the store is a great place to lounge and take a breather...  But those coffee mugs!! Just gross me out!~coffee coffee coffee ~2
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~bHfz_-9tsLgsX1ULQ9Jwkg~Had the Spanish Omelet and coffee here. The omelet was very good, I liked the flavor of the chorizo and the thin egg wrapper. The coffee was also great, bold and fresh. It also came with a guava pastry which was good, but not as flaky and airy as I had hoped. Nonetheless, paid less than eight bucks and could have saved more if I knew that UNLV students and faculty got a 20% discount.~coffee chorizo egg coffee guava ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~ub1vwlOtsGKilCPDdFPikw~We tried the medianoche, guava pastry, cortadito and empanadas ... they were good, good, good and very good, respectively.  Their selection of pastry was limited. I still think Roly's is worth trying because of the good service, cleanliness , and decent taste of food. We will be going back to try some more from their menu.  My reason for 3 stars - frankly, the best Cuban pastry&sandwich I've tried was in So Cal, Glendale at Porto's bakery and that has been my standard to beat. They have some of the best Cuban  pastry&sandwich (at least from the places I've tried).    Until I find something better than Roly's in Las Vegas, I guess this place will do.~guava ~3
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~XM4wwJlkmn5OaHPFw3eeAw~I tried some of Roly's items at a birthday party and I wanted to return. I was mainly in search of the fish croquettes which were like a creamy fish stick. These are so good and I am glad I went. I tried some pineapple coconut cake which was outstanding. Some many more items to try I can't wait to go back, the Cuban sandwich on the menu was calling my name.~croquettes pineapple coconut cake sandwich ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~GkrmHhcm0L6CpEzWfy7vXw~¡Azúcar! Is this the only Cuban bakery in Las Vegas? The sign advertises that they are "like Porto's," where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.  My first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said "cuban coffee"), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my azúcar? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.  The selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.  Prices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go. You may wait a bit for counter service, but I think that's a good sign.~coffee" guava- cheese cream cheese ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~g9luZHejvO5vLGaZSd7Dgg~Had the Cuban sandwich. On a scale of 1-10,,about 7. Flan was a little disappointing..not above 5. I would not make this a destination, but if I needed a place to eat in the area I would return.~sandwich. ~3

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~UM3MPrZEAzuTo3xehk2ihg~I was dragging during a midday slump and waiting for a friend to get out on his lunch break. Driving around the university, I spotted this bakery. I am always in search of a sweet pick me up.   Looking around, Roly's offer the usual goods and a full scale menu. If we did not have plans to go to a restaurant close by, I would have told him to meet me there. After the experience, I probably should have. Not wanting to completely gorge myself, I ordered a eclair. It is massive. For $2.75, this large pastry is nothing to complain about. The thin shell had a good bite and did not go soggy due to the cream custard filling. The chocolate dip was generous, but not too sweet. As I was paying, I saw large trays of tres leches for $10. I wished they had mini cups or single sized portions for sale. At least I know where I can get a party size tray for the next picnic UYE.  When you check in with Yelp this week, they offer a choice between a coconut or guava danish.~coconut guava ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~rbWiFG_gUgWwTdomQrjDrA~Yummo!  Very good authentic Cuban sandwiches and pastries.  Fantastic breakfast and really liked that the omelet was not greasy.  It was so tasty, filling, and budget friendly as well.    It's hard to find Ironbeer and Materva unless you're at a Cuban place and it was so exciting to get some. Om nom nom.  Since we were driving back to LA we picked up some great pastries for the ride home.    They do compare themselves to Portos (they even have a sign out front that says it), however they are not Portos.  Don't expect the crazy lines (yay).  The selection of pastries is not as large but they are just as good!~sandwiches pastries. pastries pastries ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~oaCz-G8yyp5i0-xtePaWZw~Delicious sandwiches and pastries, surly staff. No greeting, no thank you. The girl behind the counter seemed very irritated that we were asking questions such as "does the sandwich come with mayo?" and "can we get it with no pickles?" (STILL got it with pickles). I know that working with the public is unpleasant a lot (if not most) of the times but when a customer is smiling and asking a question nicely, the least you could do is fake some niceness and not act as if we're inconveniencing you. We'll be back because the food is really good, and now we know not to expect too much politeness service-wise, but it'd be nice to be able to put in an order and not be made feel like a jerk.~sandwiches pastries, sandwich pickles? pickles) ~4

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~CMBvNTgg4FiGFvdMTKZhoA~Went back here yesterday on my way out of Vegas and was excited to have some good breakfast.  I raved about this place to my dad and was so disappointed by the crummy service and the even worse food we received.  We waited over 30 minutes to get our breakfast when everyone that came in after us was served quickly.  The ladies wouldn't even look our way until my dad finally stared one down and she asked if we were waiting for our breakfast.  When I said yes with an attitude miraculously our breakfast came out. It was COLD!  All we ordered were two eggs over easy with ham croquettes (those things were horrible) our Cuban bread was so hard it was more of a cracker.  Our coffee was weak, the place was dirty and the staff just ignored us.  NM we won't be back.~croquettes ( coffee ~1

Ordered a cake day prior came for pick up it wasn't ready and they had to substitute ingredients then what they said they would put. Had me waiting for an hour. Could be just baked a cake at home probably. No sense of compromise for my disatisfaction. Got the cake for work and ended being late for work. Disappointed much senor.~cake cake cake ~1
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~1T5Y0SsBPj1_QuKxHr49EQ~What a disappointment!!!  I was excited to visit Roly's Bakery I am Cuban and recently relocated here from Miami.  Being in Vegas for a few months now I have been missing the pastelitos, Cuban bread, and sandwich.  I expected something a bit more authentic.  It's a shame the people of Las Vegas will equate Roly's Bakery with Cuban pastries since they probably don't know anything better.  First of all the Cuban bread wasn't authentic it was like the chewy bread Wal-Mart sells.  For those of you who've never had wonderful authentic Cuban bread, it has huge air pockets, is very very light in texture, with a crust that flakes almost like paper.  The pastelitos were as far away from authentic as the bread. Again, they missed the flakiness and  the taste was mediocre.  The only thing they nailed was the cod croquettes.~sandwich. pastries croquettes. ~1
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~bjw-MdsdlQco0fHpXj9mMQ~I ran into this bakery by pure chance while buying some parts for my car late one afternoon a few weeks ago... and it was the amazing smell of freshly baked goods that lured me in! A mixture between a colombian and cuban bakery, this place has some yummy breads, pastries and cakes from different regions south of the border at very reasonable prices. I purchased a toasted coconut cake, fruit pastelitos (turnovers) as well as some ground beef ones and they were all awesome. Oh yeah, and if you are in the mood for a cuban-style coffee, get ready to indulge! Their coffee is awesome. Although I did not get a chance to try their bread, it all looked very tasty.  The lady behind the counter was friendly and courteous. The owner also came out to honor a Yelp deal I received (apparently it is expired but still shows up upon checking in) and did it all with a smile!

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~DWDNAvs2tMceSlsNdy_jUA~I love this little place!   The staff was friendly.   Atmosphere was welcoming! We stopped and had a Cuban sandwich which was a pretty good size SO WE just split one.   It was good but not great.   The Cuban coffee was delicious.   Price is a little on the high end, but the pastries were delicious!   We met this cute lil Cuban man that told us that this cafe had been here for over 30 years!  They must be doing something right!  The chorizo empanadas are a MUST have!  Hope this review helps! Adios for now!~sandwich coffee pastries chorizo ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~iXSYP2dAmEWFDiTYSIMwHg~Cuban bread!  And it's good.   Cuban crackers (home made---no more shipping from Miami)!  Ahhhhh....  Pastelito de guayaba (guava) is good.   Pastelito de carne (meat) is okay.   Cuban Soul food.  I'm happy.    AND the cafecito is excellent. Have an espresso here (made with sugar, and please have it this way -- no Splenda, no fake shit!) for $1.50 and see what Cuban cafe is all about.    Cubans, we have coffee, sugar, rum and cigars. Use them all to excess and you'll be fricken happy.~guava) carne ( soul food. coffee, ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~zHfW2b3fW3WB5ndEqSaBKg~Delicious Cuban pastries, yummy breakfast omelets and affordable prices.  Ain't nothing like this in Texas. Great off the strip cafe,  you all go check it out!~pastries, ~5
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~5s4-C6heqsMtSEazguRkqg~Good food, bad service. I ordered a cuban sandwich without cheese, and somehow they heard "cheesecake". The sandwich was very tasty though, but I would add more mustard. My dining partner ordered a pizza, that was served cold, definitely not melty and delicious like picture. And we kind of were given a hard time when we asked them to heat it up. Maybe they were just having a bad day? Didn't even get a "thank you" "goodbye" or "come again"~sandwich cheese, sandwich pizza ~3

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~oGpRjhYBiX7qCQB0-HQi_w~Small place, reminded me of being back home with family. Staff was very nice and the food was good. This was our 1st time having Cuban food. We will be back to enjoy more desserts.~desserts. ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~kJkq4dvXZvRA4R-U0vDw1Q~Nice local bakery. Everytime I go everyone is friendly and it's never been crazy crowded or anything. I like all of their pastries and cakes that have fruit in them like the guava pastry, mango cake, and coconut and pineapple cake. But the main reason why I come here is for their Tres Leches! My second runner up would be the Tres Leches at Drago Sister's Bakery but their style is a bit more of a American version, sweeter, more dense, not as light. But here, the cake is really moist, flavorful without being too sweet and their whipped topping is so silky and just delicious! They also sell them in a variety of sizes. Definitely my go-to cake to bring to parties or take home after a crappy day at UNLV lol! :)~pastries guava mango cake, coconut pineapple cake. cake cake ~4

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~r4DO45pByrYHZjxjsQEiMw~I've driven by Roly's dozens of times. It's a small little mom-and-pop joint located across the street from UNLV. One thing that caught my eye about this place is a sign that touts that they have the best Cuban sandwiches. When someone makes that sort of claim, I don't just take their word for it. I take this matter into my own hands.  Walking in, I saw their array of baked goods right away. Some being traditional items like cheesecakes, croissants, as well as their own selection of treats of Hispanic influence. Everything looked absolutely delicious, but I had to pass since I was there looking for a meaty lunch. Those sweet treats were put there to distract me when I had a sign to challenge.  The Cuban sandwich comes to about $8 + tax. It comes with the traditional works: ham, sliced pork, some pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard served between their own baked bread. In terms of flavor, the sandwich could have had more, especially with their sliced pork. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it left me feeling indifferent. I kinda like my Cuban sandwich a bit more greasy and toasty. Sorry Roly's, but this was not the best Cuban sandwich. It was a bit to plain for my tastes. I have to admit that the thing was gigantic though. *3/5 stars based on the sandwich alone  I decided to bump the overall rating to 4 stars due to how delicious everything else looked. They even had chorizo pizza and empanadas, which I definitely have to come back to try. Their cakes are very extensive and have so many other baked goods that's sure to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'll keep that in mind the next time that I drop by.~sandwiches. sandwich pork, pickles, swiss cheese ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~gXi-brQgknV52srRmsHexg~This place is great!  Especially if you like good Cuban coffee and a pastry to go with it.  But they also had a good breakfast offering.  I had the veggie omelet and the choritzo omelet.  Both were great with fresh ingredients.  But most impressive was the coffee.  They make a classic Cuban coffee with sugar, and they also make a great cafe con leche.  Interestingly, if you search for coffee houses in Las Vegas, almost all of them are some distance away from the strip.  I guess that is because the coffee houses serve people living here, not the tourists.  So this was a great find, although it will take a car to get there.  Highly recommended.  By the way, they also run a wedding cake business from the same bakery, but you can get many of the cakes by the slice - nice!~coffee coffee. coffee coffee coffee cake ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~rshsfm757bJ8klIHIQ8xnw~I'm happy that my brother, a Las Vegas resident, knows all the decent bakeries in town. Since Roly's Cuban bakery is near McCarran, we often stop here before heading to my mom's when I fly into town. So if you get on Tropicana leaving the airport, turn right.  In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside. And it's not particularly descript on the inside until you look at the display cases full of pastries and the most beautiful cakes.  The two women working inside didn't speak much English, but I speak enough Spanish that with the menu having pictures and prices, it's no problem. Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)  Pastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.  Too bad we didn't taste the cakes. The ones we saw were beautiful, and if they tasted anything like they looked they would be perfect.  We don't plan to order any cakes soon, but this would definitely be a spot to order one.  There are table and chairs for those ordering their sandwiches and relaxing.~pastries hamburger. burger burgers, burger patty, chorizo patty, chorizo bell burger pastries mango cake, mango white cake mango white cake guava cheese coconut coconut cake sandwiches ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~KCnBCtfrYe_WyyCwOSeqKw~Ordered a cake for my daughter's first birthday and it was terrific!   Having recently ordered a cake for another event at another bakery and being pretty dissatisfied, I was really stressed about this cake order. Roly's came highly recommended from another Mommy friend of mine so I gave it a shot.   The place isn't much to look at and I wouldn't describe the guy who took my cake order as super friendly but he listened to everything that I said. I had several photos of cakes from Pinterest and u was kind of combining them all to create the perfect cake for my little's perfect party. The guy was patient and took lots of notes. Then we got to flavors. They have tons to choose from and lots of fillings as well. We ordered a two tier cake (30 servings) so I got chocolate with raspberry filling for the top and Cuban cake (which he described as a very moist white cake) with Bavarian cream coconut filling.   I braced myself for the cost: $172! This was extremely reasonable. So reasonable in fact that my neurotic brain started worrying about the quality of the cake.   When I picked the cake up, it wasn't ready. We had about a 15 min wait which normally would not have bothered me but it was the morning of her party and I had tons to do so I was a little agitated.   Any and all agitation immediately dissipated upon seeing the cake! It was PERFECT! Exactly what I asked for.  Driving the cake home was nerve wracking and next time I will definitely pay for delivery.   The most important thing is this was also one of the best cakes I had ever tasted. Moist and cool with the perfect amount of evenly sweet frosting. I got several compliments from the parents and the kids devoured it!  My only regret was I didn't get to try the chocolate tier. I blinked and it was gone!   I will absolutely be ordering again!~cake cake cake cake cake cake ( cake ( white cake) coconut cake. cake cake! cake ~4

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~kt8uqKVEV4Cpfnr_c9d3XA~I had no idea this was a Cuban bakery. I was pretty excited when I looked at all the pastries.    The place is pretty clean. The bathrooms too! I don't  know why, but clean bathrooms, to me, are a good sign that their kitchens are also well kept. I could be wrong but whatever. The staff has all their hair in place which is also a good sign. The desserts looked extremely appetizing. I decided to buy their beef pastry, sausage pastry, senorita, meringue, and tres leches.   The beef and sausage were okay. The senorita was good but I couldn't get myself to eat it all. The crust it had was a bit hard to get through with a fork. The filling was good but the lack of other flavors other than the vanilla made me get bored of it quickly. The meringue was good too. I don't think anyone can mess that up.  The tres leches on the other hand was awful! It was just cake and milk mush with whip cream on top. It was gross! I always though tres leches should be a little dense. Oh well. I might come here to try their Cuban sandwiches and rereview.   One star for the nice cashier. One for the cleanliness. And one for okay pastries.~pastries. desserts beef sausage beef sausage cake milk sandwiches pastries. ~3
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~5azUe7LwgYSarcX1sKGU2A~Items Selected: Guava and Cheese Turnover Cappucinno Flan Pan Con Croqueta - Ground Seasoned Ham Croquettes with Swiss Cheese Served on Toasted Bread  Located on East Tropicana Avenue and as such driven past thrice weekly en route to work it was largely an effect of location and ongoing intrigue that led me to Roly's Bakery on Saturday afternoon and opting for a small selection due to otherwise substantial eating plans my experience was fine, though certainly not without flaws.  Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.  Small, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like crème brûlée, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.~guava cheese croquettes swiss cheese ~3

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~WsOnVtXKIR1go3I7g6Fi2w~I LOVE this place! I found it on yelp when I was looking for breakfast places near the airport.  The bakery is in a little shopping center and unless you are actually looking for it you may miss it.  We went for breakfast and had the vegetable omelet. It was like $5 and it includes coffee or soda, toast and even a delicious pastry.  It was a super deal, delicious, very clean and the staff was super friendly. Very nice family owned place with very inexpensive home cooked food. You HAVE to go if you need a break from the strip or if you have a little time before your flight.~coffee ~5
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~4dPtj8Y10PLKjtDriALQVA~Been here a few times. Got a couple cuban sandwiches n pasteles de guayava.  Both times the pasteles we're stale and flavorless, biting into them I knew immediately they were there for hours.  Not good at all. The sandwich the first time was good. Unfortunately the 2nd time. They forgot the pickles that give it a nice flavorful kick. If it weren't for that fact that there's really not many CUBAN places to go. I'd probably would never come back. This is definitely NO PORTOS FROM CALIFORNIA.~sandwiches sandwich pickles ~2
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~CYdATuh_J3p8D2Mx2Wqq_w~Great little shop on the corner of Trop and Maryland. I cant say a whole lot about the pastries but the Looked incrediable! A bit pricey but I'm sure well worth it.  I tried the Cuban Sandwich- very simple ham, mustard, pickle, swiss/mozzarella cheese. what stuck out was the BREAD- OMG, it was so soft. I cant tell you how it's made but it was the first time I've ever tasted bread with that sort of texture. Try it, it's good- but I warn you the sandwich is quiet large.   If you're looking for something to wash it down with try a good ol Malta Goya! very unusual taste- but you might like it!~pastries cheese. sandwich ~3
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~Yyn9CVIBrbf0W23r1VmFlg~Ordered a custom cake from here for.my daughters birthday. The cake itself was decorated well. Unfortunately  the cake itself was super dense and odd tasting for a vanilla cake. The raspberry filling was nothing more than jelly. For paying 60 bucks for it, it was definitely not worth it.~cake cake cake cake. ~2
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~p5vRBcOIqGlslAXiesL7yQ~Small place with big flavor.  Be careful you may want to get up and start dancing to the music playing in the place.  Not very many breakfast selections but it worked for this family of 5.  What they did have they did it right.  Food was very tasty and portions were large.  Came with coffee and a pastry so you can't go wrong.  I had the breakfast croissant and it was very, very good.~coffee ~4

ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~nFsOPFFMMSU_Taak3bkwzQ~We haven't really ordered food but their pastries are yummy.  The senorita a refrigerated pastry is yummy. I like the guava/cheese turnover and the cheese roll.~pastries cheese ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~U-3ifL_Cq1LRzjb-OS0l2g~I first visited Roly's Bakery two weeks ago with my husband. We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe.   Confession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed.   Though I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner.   My husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.  We ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos.   The coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).  The pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA#ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA  A quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day. The latter was what brought us back today.   There are four combos available:   #1: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), and coffee for about $5  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=X0sEYYhXQ6bCbjH_f1SMRg#X0sEYYhXQ6bCbjH_f1SMRg  #2: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), pastry, and coffee for about $6 #3: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), ham croquette, pastry, and coffee for about $7  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas#24c6bmIEBCafd6T-POQqHA  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw#ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw   #4: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), marinated steak, pastry, and coffee for about $8   To each combo, you can add ham, sausage, and other items for $1/each .  In addition, there are four omelette selections: western, spanish, veggie, and one other that escapes me. All come with a pastry and coffee.   I ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?  My husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, "Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?". I took a bite and can attest to the fact that these are the best croquettes I've had from an eatery.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g#XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g  All in all, breakfast came to about $13 before tip. We plan to come back for the Cuban pizza and, honestly, for more of everything else.~coffee appetizers, coffee guava cheese coffee: coffee coffee guava cream cheese ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~5wOKTfNI0w1ryw0ZVGJvLg~Cuban sandwiches and coffee. Yummy! The pasteries are great, too, if  you like the flakey kind. My biggest complaint is that they take a very, very long time to get a to-go order ready. It took over half an hour to get a freaking sandwich made. If you aren't in a hurry and love a good Cuban bakery, this is a good one. I would go there again.~sandwiches coffee. sandwich ~4
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~RQ6_EJucP7J0loJAg8V-UQ~This place is amazing. I have gone there every single time I wanted / needed a cake. They're cakes are delicious and so moist. The spaghetti.. There is so much of it and its just so great. The sandwiches are massive. About the same size of the bag. Which is a good size and its thick. Also the pizza is soft, its smooth, its fantastic. Best pizza in vegas.~cake. spaghetti.. sandwiches pizza pizza ~5
ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag~14ucs86J9pxRITFVHoes9g~I last visited Roly's a few months back, but I wanted to write a review and forgot...sorry.  Anyway, I am Dominican and I was born and raised in Miami. Many of my friends growing up are Cuban.  To this day, when I go home to Miami my dad goes to Riviera Bakery on 17th ave to get me an assortment of pastelitos. So, I consider myself an honorary Cuban pastry connoisseur.  With that said, I will say that Roly's is pretty good, for Vegas.  I've had the pastelittos (pastries) - cheese, guava, guava with cheese and meat. All good, but not as flaky and yummy as I am used to.  I've had the croquettes, and they are okay as well.  I had a mango milkshake and a mamay milkshake and they were both good.   Can't go wrong with a cafe con leche.   So here's the deal.  If you're expecting authentic "from back home" stuff, then you're going to be disappointed.  But, if you just need a little fast of home to get you through the day, week or months, then you'll be okay.  They do a good job and trying to make everything truly as Cuban as possible and you have to give credit where it's due.  And if there are Cubans in there on a regular basis drinking coffee and eating sandwiches, then it's gotta have some authenticity to it.  Give it at try!!~pastries) cheese, guava, guava cheese croquettes, mango milkshake milkshake coffee sandwiches, ~3
0J2QK4Hk8EvJKYGu65qH8w~5qlbW8eQz8O60-ov4hDB9g~In a surprise move, I think this Borders actually wins when placed in such close proximity to the Barnes and Noble (also in Crocker Park--why?).  I do usually choose B&N, but I think I liked the Borders experience better in this location. Firstly, it's a little bit easier to approach/find parking for than the B&N (when coming from 90, it's a quick right on Detroit, then left into the parking lot, as opposed to weaving in and out of Crocker Park "streets"). It's right next to the movie theater and Spoon Me, two of the main reasons I have to visit Crocker Park (the other being Liquid Planet, but I think Spoon Me trumps that one as well).  Also, I like the layout of this Borders. They have a nice kids' section and a much larger parenting/education section than the Barnes and Noble (yes, I suppose since I'm a mom now, I have to take these things into consideration).   Checkout took exactly 30 seconds.  I'm not entirely sold on Seattle's Best Coffee yet, but it's not a dealbreaker. I will definitely give this Borders more traffic in the future.~coffee ~4
0J2QK4Hk8EvJKYGu65qH8w~BNq1eYdiPehgV-0pUz5Nhw~This Borders is a great spot to grab a table and get some work done.  Free wifi, tasty snacks and drinks (including a peach smoothie which was extremely yummy) make it easy for you to spend hours here without even realizing it.  The facility was clean (including the restrooms - I checked the girls' and my hubby checked the guys'), and the staff was friendly!  On top of that with this Borders being in the heart of Crocker Park, there are tons of restaurants, stores, etc. just footsteps away from you.  I'll definitely be back!~peach smoothie ~5
0J2QK4Hk8EvJKYGu65qH8w~k_HAk4nBOXFtTZzT6WUTpw~I remember long ago when The Promenade of Westlake was built, bringing Borders and several other great tenants along with it. Seriously, that feels like ages ago...and despite all of that time, this place still is goin' strong. I was afraid that the arrival of Barnes and Noble 50 feet or so away from here would kill off Borders, but as of now, Borders is still alive and well. Maybe it's because the prices are cheaper? Finding a good deal at Barnes and Noble happens occurs just as often as passenger pigeon sightings...whereas Borders typically has some type of deal running, and if you're a Borders Rewards member, you can nearly ALWAYS find a discount coupon either via the web or their emails...and if you aren't able to find one, wait a few minutes and one will probably appear in your email! =) (I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to be in Borders Rewards, considering that it's FREE to join...but hey, the money that isn't being saved on discounts goes into the economy, which seems like a good thing these days, right?)  Also, their coffee shop offers cheap refills, which is nice for the days when you're relaxing with a big stack of the latest magazines...~coffee ~5
0J2QK4Hk8EvJKYGu65qH8w~FKQtZUQSpt4Qt3MllzSaBg~Rip-off the man!  THE UP-SIDE:  Books, CD's (for those without iPods!) and lot's of cards and stuff.  This place is pretty clean, efficient and friendly.  Best of all, they have a coffee shop in house where you can read all the books without paying for them!    THE DOWN-SIDE:  Like a big, dumb, lumbering corporate dinosaur, this place has the nerve to still charge for the wireless internet.  WTF?!  You gotta be kidding me!  (If you're a smarty-smartster like me, you'll just grab the FREE wi-fi signal that wafts through from neighboring Bruegger's Bagels across the way!  Me loves to rip-off the man.)  In addition, this place attempts to push their "Borders Rewards Cards" with every purchase.  This isn't such a big deal, as most employees here will accept it when you say you don't want one.  However, there is one absolutely annoying Borders drone that works in the coffee shop area.  He will annoy you to no end, practically force-feeding the benefits down your throat.  I've told him I don't want one, that I visit the store every week, and that he has asked me over 10 times so far.  I told him, "Please remember me and never ask again."  He refused and said he will always ask.  He just doesn't care that he is annoying me and will basically always do so.  Great customer service there.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for a good selection of books and to rip-off the free wi-fi from a neighboring business.  Good stuff!~coffee coffee ~4
4eoZjaMw54QHoAHHcvcZdg~FxmE-i9ah5AqyZHQgqYN2w~It's a small location, but they have a healthy selection of products for natural and curly hair. They carry Miss Jessie's, Shea Moisture, Mizani, As I Am Coconut, and as of recently, Carol's Daughter as well. Currently, they only have CD's Black Vanilla products.  I was happy when, after learning of my hesitance to try the Black Vanilla, the employee advised me that I can try it and return it if I don't like it.  (Use less than 1/3 of the product for this to apply.)  Well, I tried it and did not like it.  I returned with my receipt and had a hassle-free return experience.  The woman who was working when I returned even offered to special order some of the other products in the CD line, which they didn't currently carry in-store.    I was happy with the customer service and the ease with which I was able to shop and return items.~curly coconut, ~4

4eoZjaMw54QHoAHHcvcZdg~G6fBLmLvJHcxODmzqi7ktQ~So flippin' excited that this location is now open!!  Hair Extensions, ethnic hair supplies, regular nail polish, gel polish, eye lashes, shampoo (no, conditioner is better), hair saving re-nourishment masks for when your DIY bleach job leaves your hair a little fried (or so I have heard...), line this small, but packed store. They are still stocking their shelves so some items might be sparse, like the Gelish gel polish collection, but don't fret, the shipment is coming!  As usual, with Sally Stores, I was greeted by a very friendly employee. She was busy stocking shelves, but still stopped to look up and put the items in her hands back in the box as to give me full attention, and asked if she could help me find an item. I told her I was there just to check out this new location as I have been going to the Bell and Indian Bend locations. She laughed and said not to worry about loyalty cause these three stores are in the same district so everyone gets credit. I laughed at her response and proceeded to mosey on around the store and secretly take pictures to post on here...and then I ended up buying $28 worth of supplies. My budget will probably be ruined now because of this location, but at least my nails and hair will look fierce!  P.S. If you are not familiar with Sally Beauty Supply, it is open to the public, no cosmetology license required.~bell ~5
4xETVbh239uFddQ0ZBI0PA~fYiuaEfKkIbTua4dsWHcig~This place gave me mixed feelings about their Pho.  Although the broth, seasoning and garnishes were fresh and bursting with flavor, I was highly disappointed with the chicken (I got the "Pho Ga").  Sadly, it was bland and was nothing like the soup or noodles.  On the flip side, the portions are huge.  I got the size small (CAN$5.25) and had enough leftover to make it into another meal.  Plus, the small order of spring rolls (CAN$3.75) was crisp so it kind of made it up for the bland chicken... kind of.  I would come back here, but I'll order a different type of meat.~chicken ( soup chicken... ~4
4xETVbh239uFddQ0ZBI0PA~r8r0ZTUuyehYifiU5dN8bw~I was excited to find a vietnamese place near work that was fast and good. The beef is great and there's a lot of fresh good herbs. Spring Rolls are tasty and crispy. Service was good and fast, and I got back to work on time!~beef ~4
1AXbGcdRlG09cgvHNaIj7Q~4egXmJ3kpoOY1iueMS53tA~I visited this place couple of days ago for the first time.. I must say pretty nice.. I used to live in Iran when I was young.. And the offerings in the store reminded me of that.  Tried the hot food section.. Beef kebab (Koobideh) pretty good portions and also very tasty. Also the Gormeh Sabzi (Beef Curry with fragrant herbs), which was pretty good, but a bit too much lemon. But still pretty good  Will definitely be back!~beef beef lemon. ~4
1AXbGcdRlG09cgvHNaIj7Q~zna32Eapkkv1EYjIl1ypCw~This review just covers the hot foods section.  It's actually a supermarket which has a hot foods section that serves Persian food.  I came here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.    Pros: Very good prices for Persian take out Meat is "naturally raised"  Cons: The lamb shank could be better  I had a hankering for some Persian food and was on my way up Yonge Street to get some.  I passed by Urmia Market and decided to give it a go.  I'm glad I made the decision.  This place is very good for Persian take out.  The lady behind the counter was very nice.  It was my first time and she treated my like a regular.  She was very polite and made sure I got exactly what I wanted.  I got 2 Beef Koobideh and a lamb shank dinners.  Dinners come with rice, roasted tomatoes and a salad.  Beef was $6.99 and the lamb shank was $7.99.  These are great prices for Persian food, some of the best I've seen.  There's a place south of where I live that charges 14.99 for the same beef dinner.  The beef tasted great.  The store says all their meat is naturally raised with no chemicals or hormones.  I like that sound of that.  The lamb shank was a bit smaller than I'm used to getting.  It was OK, but I've had better.  Still doesn't take away from the place.   All in all, this place is great if you have a craving for Persian food.  Prices are great and the food is good.  Can't go wrong there.  I'm definitely going back the next time I have a craving.~lamb beef lamb salad. beef lamb beef beef lamb ~4
1AXbGcdRlG09cgvHNaIj7Q~3MKZ9WnmtZS1v4yo3tELQA~I went here again and I am now a devoted fan.  THIS PLACE ROCKS!!! BIG TIME!  I got some chicken again and am now heating it up for brekkie.  The 'fat', which I decided to save was very soft, like room temperature butter and melted when I spread it over my cold rice.  This people, is what the naturally raised meat and fat does.  It was not grey and hard like the crap from Maple Sludge Farms.  It was as nature intended. This is actually healthy fat. Once again, the guy at the meat counter is very knowledgeable and very friendly.  Smiling and willing to go out of his way so that you have the best grocery experience ever.  It is people like him that make me love shopping. The shelves are packed with traditional Persian foods, so the experimental foodie will love it. I got a chance to go to the deli on my visit. Can you say OMG!!!  This food was FANTASTIC.  And I am not exaggerating.  I had these balls, like Indian kofta, delicious.  And some walnut chicken.  They did NOT  skimp on the walnuts.  It was so friggin' good. The walnut oil oozing on top, so healthy, good for the brain.  OMG, these guys can cook.  I am going to try everything, something new each time. THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!!!~chicken butter chicken. ~5
-GOpxpQbDcfioE-vQ55h6A~Xlm5Vw7Fr3fy2UskZDkJiw~Went to Villa Massimo twice and was satisfied both times. The seafood risotto was perfect. The service was great. Loved that old school Italian feel. The only down side is it is waaaay to expensive. Sure, all is good but you can get food like this in the city for half the price.  But seeing that there aren't many places like this in the south shore, for a romantic evening without having to cross any of the bridge traffic, it's worth it. So, go and mangia, mangia!~risotto ~3
-GOpxpQbDcfioE-vQ55h6A~JhbvUMG6jKLF6yaqdB2cBA~We had a party of seven, all ordered something different and everyone thought their plate was the best. From Osso Buco to swordfish to vegetarian lasagne, we all shared tastes and all agreed it was excellent.   The service and menu knowledge of the waiters was excellent. Not to mention the owner who walks from table to table chatting it up.  We enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  Visited July 2013~osso buco lasagne, ~5
-GOpxpQbDcfioE-vQ55h6A~ZNJFQTUT4KsYMgVSTZ3RVw~Hidden gem of Italian experience hiding in La Prairie.  Decorated with wine bottles, this restaurant feels almost like a home. This is a bit pricey, but you are getting your money's worth. I started with a delicious Caesar Salad, then for entree had their house made Gnocchi.  The Gnocchi is served in a wine sauce with Gorgonzola cheese. Fantastic. Coffee was good.   Five star service, wonderful staff.~salad, gnocchi. gnocchi cheese. coffee ~4
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~_NQDyIvuBaHJ038fc8okBg~Prob the worst dining experience I've had. Overpriced. Empty (it's obvious why - first RED FLAG). Sub-par food, even worse service. Stopped in because I wasn't in the mood for sushi or pizza, which are the only other options in the plaza. Ate half of my bland sandwich, the chipotle chicken (WHAT CHIPOTLE!?), and left.   I stopped at McDonald's on the way home. And you know what? Even though I regretted that, it was still a huge step up from this dump. Try at your own risk...~sushi pizza sandwich, chicken ( ~1
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~koMK8hv-XfqIPNrddCBZvg~Dad and I came here for lunch. They had options of either a quesadilla-type wrap or a panini.  I got the italian-type panini "new jersey" or something. It was so good with the panini bread, it was fresh-tasting. Dad got the special panini which was "Uncle Luigi" which was similar to mine, but with turkey. My dad loved every bite of his sandwich. They came with a small serving of potato chips.  We would definitely come back!~sandwich. potato chips. ~4
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~NDjYMmcn1TQ9dY55WKY40A~We stopped in for lunch a few Saturdays ago and were pleasantly surprised by the food and service that we received at what from the outside appears to be a fairly nondescript establishment.  My husband ordered a veggie wrap and I had the chicken taco salad and asked them to go light on the cheese and to substitute salsa in place of the chipotle dressing.  My salad arrived exactly as I had ordered it, the ingredients were fresh, and the salsa flavorful.  My husband's veggie wrap was also very tasty and had fresh ingredients and a soft, high quality tortilla.  We sat on the patio and the waiter was quick in refilling our drinks and providing service.  The chef is an incredibly nice guy and brought us some complimentary "granita", which is an Italian shaved ice made with fruit juice and no additional sugars.  He explained that this dessert is made by freezing the mixture in a pan and scraping the pan with a fork every 15 minutes to create the light, fluffy shaved ice texture.  The granita was so delicious, we would go back just for that!  I certainly hope that others will give Mumbles Place a try as this is a great little place that we really hope stays around.~chicken taco salad cheese salsa salad salsa ~4
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~ZxJYMQuAyWlb-NbXPWp6lw~Utter garbage and one of the worst places I have ever dined at. It is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant/bar that it pretty difficult to find. Arrived at 6:50PM and there was one waitress/bartender and one cook.  I was not greeted upon entry and ended up just sitting down. The waitress was either playing with her phone all night or talking to the gentleman at the bar, After given a menu, waitress did not come back for another 10 minutes. Ordered. Appetizer arrived and was not served plates so ate off the board. A Chipotle Chicken  panini took over 30 minutes to come out, with the wrong side order and a ton of onions and instead of correcting it - just took it because I was sick of waiting. The chocolate cake took 10 minutes to come out, it was pretty good - ended up having a hair in it. I was leaving and I was the one who said goodbye - the customer.  Do not come here. Period.~chicken chocolate cake ~1
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~fwOOZh3g8dlhoK4VGm2iJw~Hungry for a good lunch at a good price, I found Mumbles in my Groupon Now options. I bought their $5 for $9 Worth of Hot Pressed Wraps or Panini Sandwiches deal and made my way over, excited to give them a second try since the last time I'd been here, they were still rather new.   The place was empty when I walked in. A waitress was standing there looking at me like I was a freaking alien, so I cheerily said "Hi there!" to HER. I said it to HER. She kept staring. I told her I'd gotten a Groupon Now deal as I went to sit at the bar. She nodded, but looked completely flustered and finally grabbed a menu for me and asked "This is To Go?" in a way that pushed me to say yes, even though I was expecting to eat there. She stood right in front of me while I was trying to figure out what to order while tapping her pen on the counter, making me feel rushed.   I had planned on getting a panini, so I looked at the paninis (the menu has changed significantly since we'd been there) and quickly saw that NO panini was $9. They're either $10 or $11. uhhhhhh okay. So I looked through the wraps. They were all $6-8, so whatever. I'll lose my extra $1 in savings. No big deal, so I order an $8 wrap called Popeye something or other, trying not to think about how it seemed a little sneaky to offer a deal for something that forces you to pay more or save less once you get there.  The waitress puts my order in their system and I give her my phone with the Groupon code pulled up. She writes down the information and she hands me my phone back and I hold onto it for a little while until she walks away and then I hit the "redeemed" button. She came back from the kitchen area looking even more confused and flustered than before. She needed to look at the code again because it wasn't going in the system. I tell her that it can't be pulled up after it's been redeemed, but I can try? So I do and show her that the code is gone. She huffs and paces and taps her pen against the bar some more, making me feel really uncomfortable, until she finally goes to the back again and time passes. When she comes back, our conversation goes like this:  Waitress: "Oh my boss figured out why it wasn't working."  Natalie G: "Oh, okay that's good!"  W: "It's because the Groupon is for a PANINI, not a wrap. When they put up the Groupon, it's not supposed to say wrap. So since you got a wrap, it's $8, not $9 like the Groupon says and that's for a panini"  NG: "..............Come again?" W: "You have to pay $8 for the wrap"  NG:"I have to pay $8 on top of the $5 from the Groupon? There aren't even any paninis that cost $9. And the Groupon says wrap... I don't think I understand why I would be paying extra."  W: *huff huff pace pace tap tap pace huff*  I finally tell her I want to speak to her boss or manager or whoever is back there and so she disappears again. When she came back, she hands me my food and just offhandedly tells me that "It was taken care of."  YEAH IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. Where is my apology? Where was the manager? Why is this even an issue? Does the waitress know customer service at all? Good luck, Mumbles. I don't know how you survived this long.~wraps sandwiches wraps. ~1
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~7wKMXHYpa3M7SxmvLx22MA~Saw a deal on Living Social so decided to give this place a try.  So glad we did!!  My hubby started with a Mumble's Margarita-  it was delicious!  This is coming from a gal who doesn't like margaritas!  It was so good in fact, I decided to order one for myself.  We tried to squeeze the manager for his secrets.  He wouldn't divulge them all, but they do make their own sour mix which makes such a huge difference!!   We ordered a caprese salad as a starter-- and then each had an entree.  I had a wrap and my husband ordered one of their panini's.  All of the items we had were fresh and delicious!!  They did a very unique take on what would normally be very traditional menu items.  Nothing over the top but simple- such as adding fresh dill & parsley to the caprese salad, which surprisingly turbo charged the flavors!   The service was very attentive and friendly.  I enjoyed it so much I brought my friend here for lunch the next day.  We both ordered different items and they were equally as delicious as the day before.  All in all- the place has alot of potential.  Great food, friendly atmosphere at mid-range prices.  Only suggestion I would make is they need a big sign up top so people know where to go.~salad parsley salad, ~5
0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw~XEJVOlpe1zJjNmCKZlgJ7g~A surprise winner!  I avoided going to Mumbles for almost two months, since every time I passed the place was empty.  What a mistake!  From the outside it seems to be just another bar that serves sandwiches.  But these are not ordinary sandwiches.  The fresh paninis are just different enough to wake up your taste buds.  Try a Long Island Louie.  Better yet, check out the hot-pressed tortillas.  Think of it as a roll-up pressed into a panini oven and grilled, then sliced into quarters and served standing up like a sushi roll with a dipping sauce.  I had the Mumbles Crumbles with shaved beef, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and a blue cheese sauce.  Great!  And ask about dessert.  Don't be discouraged that there's nothing on the menu except granita.  The banana split was a delight.  I don't even like banana splits but was talked into it after being shown a picture.  It was not your usual gooey mess, but had a single banana sliced, covered with sugar, then broiled to caramelize it, topped with three  small scoops of ice cream, nuts, berries, brownie bites and pound cake bites.  The atmosphere was cozy on the inside with a cute patio in front.  The service was very friendly, but a bit too slow to warrant five stars.~sandwiches. sandwiches. tortillas. sushi beef, cheese banana banana banana ice cream, cake ~4
GdQqhyy8bx0iU6IErIt1WQ~rpNdDsM9ztu08r5WZxk-oQ~Not sure where the negative feedback is based on for this place.   Service has always been great whenever I've gone here; greeted with a smile, my order is never messed up, and they can keep up with a long line -  which has never gotten too long.   They have a large shelf for pastries and cakes, larger than other Second Cup locations I've seen. This, they have a wide variety.   It's a very large space, and it's rare for me to go here and not find a seat. Lots of tables to sit and do your work or chat with a friend.   There's an outdoor patio (though it doesn't face Yonge, that would've been nice for people watching) and it's located above a subway stop. And a 20-second walk to grocery, LCBO, and a Cineplex.   Great location, great Second Cup.~pastries ~5
HPjOwB5dgIMdL3DOk6abGw~C40VjlwNGVTCVSl0Aknqnw~Just drove by and decided turn into Golden Gate Plaza  since its a beautiful day to have ice cream. This is located in a residential area which makes it convenient for families to walk over and grab a treat. The service is fast and friendly and they have an outside seating area too! It seemed busy so I will assume that it is quite popular with the locals. I will be coming here more often for either ice cream or fruit smoothie with ma homies.~ice cream. ice cream smoothie ~5
HPjOwB5dgIMdL3DOk6abGw~7mWjza-j1sykCKvYryYXaA~I've been here a couple times for ice cream but I have to say it's the dirtiest Dairy Queen location I've ever been to (and I promise I've been to loads of Dairy Queen locations in Ontario). The staff was either not trained properly or just choose to be lazy and unfriendly to the customers. It's also the only location where you can't really see the food when they're making it for you. The best Dairy Queen location in Brampton is definitely the Centre St location, great patio and great service there.~ice cream ~2
HPjOwB5dgIMdL3DOk6abGw~eSQlN_vBeu7-IYY4fFWWVA~I love this DQ. It's close to my house which is a bonus,  so whenever I'm wanting Ice-cream I always make my way there.   The staff are nice, friendly and paitent when I'm making my orders (because sometimes it takes some time to decide) and they offer great suggestions when I'm undecided.   Also,  they made me an ice cream cake for my birthday and it was Awesome. It was the same girl who did my cake last year and she remembered me. She was extremely helpful and great when I was loading suggestions and ideas to her. She made my cake Exactly how I wanted it,  and I couldn't have been happier.   I am a regular here and will continue to be. This place is great and I love it!~ice cream cake ~5
2ZZmVT4Y8Rk3OIzu18PvFQ~SiOM9GLjkKKN1AXUr0kbKA~Is this the best pizza in the world?  No.  But for $5.00 for a medium (14") cheese pizza, and $1.00 per topping, I'll take it!!  I don't know if this is "true" New York pizza, but it's certainly a departure from the national chains.  Not thick crust, but not crispy thin either, and just the right amount of good sauce.  I personally would like a bit more cheese - but my friends think it's perfect just as is.  The sausage and pepperoni are better than what I've had on other pies delivered locally.  This pizza is great fresh and hot, but is just as good two hours later when there's a break in the action in the Friday night poker game.  The perfect food for weekends!  The menu says they offer wings and chicken fingers too - maybe someday we'll branch out from a stack of pizzas on a Friday night.  The specialty pizzas, calzones and strombolis sound incredible.  Here's hoping this little pizza joint at Serene & Tamarus sticks around - they've already dropped their prices in the two months they've been open (the menu with my pizzas tonight had new prices.)~pizza cheese pizza pizza cheese - sausage pepperoni pizza chicken fingers pizza ~4
0x-mYPoatVE0DNlZhha0_w~DeHkI5QZCch62Eznnl6Btw~Attempted to return our truck here. The owner or lady at the desk was so RUDE. She appeared annoyed the instant we walked in. Wouldn't accept our truck without ALL paperwork. Come to find out after calling budget, she could've looked up our info on the computer. Lazy and rude. The customer service rep called her, she wouldn't answer so they left her a message. When we returned the second time she was on the phone arguing with customer service about us. We told her we would just return the truck to a corporate office. She then stated "fine!" and threw the keys at us. YIKES. Not only will I not be using budget, I won't be using this place for storage either. Attitude adjustment ma'am.~instant ~1

Most items were fair and average at best  CONS: Hawk/Camp out with the anxious, greedy patrons for Lobster re-fill, you have to time it right and make sure you're either 1st or 2nd in line, otherwise, you end up with nothing and could be the 1st for the next batch.

-lWLXHxSkvZ7wSs4V9vmwQ~FMZtt8fN8BZhhMi5iCbt-Q~We live pretty close to City Buffet (Used to be called Zen Buffet) and my kids, who are buffet freaks, have been waiting to try it, and I saw that they just had a name change this week and had new prices listed outside.  For adult it was priced $8.99 for the buffet and with 4 teens that's a great price, because they sure can eat!  The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs, drinks were being refilled without asking, and there was a good amount of people in restaurant. Now I have to state that even though my kids are into the buffet dining experience, I am not, but having said that, the place does offer a variety of dishes, all of my kids where equally happy with the selection that they had and everyone did get plenty.  If you are a person who likes seafood, they had plenty for you, shrimp, crab, mussels, other fish; one of my daughters loved the fact that there was even sushi.  The place was clean and staff was always making sure there was never an empty dish.  According to my kids the only down side was that they stated the ice cream was lacking in flavor.  I am sure I will be taking them back their again to eat.~shrimp, sushi. ice cream ~3
-lWLXHxSkvZ7wSs4V9vmwQ~Fuw6Aqacfl5Np4abNK0tzw~This place used to be called Jen Buffet. They're now under the dubious ownership of City Buffet, though the chef is still the same (for now).  Seriously underrated. I'm Chinese, so naturally, I love buffets. Still, I find most of the offerings in Arizona to be lackluster if not downright disgusting. In terms of seafood, the quality at Jen Buffet (or City Buffet, as it's called now) is fresher than even Pacific Buffet, specifically the sushi/sashimi and the shrimp. The grilled fish is also really fresh. There are less items than Pacific Buffet, but the quality is generally better. Here's the run-down of my experience.  Day of the Week: Saturday Night  People: Generally empty--there was one family speaking Cantonese seated near us, but mostly non-Asian diners  What I ate (at least, what I could remember): Tuna and Salmon sashimi--fresh if small-portioned Various sushi items--typical California roll, Philly roll, spicy tuna--fresh and tasty Seaweed salad--too salty Octopus--too salty Mussels--chewy and fairly fresh Oysters--clean oyster taste, though my brother complained his was bitter and had sand in it Crayfish: Cantonese family swooped down on these as soon as they refilled the tray; did not get to try these Clams: fresh and tasty!!!!! Roast Beef: My piece was a bit tough/overdone in texture, but the flavor was good Coconut Shrimp: The one Americanized Chinese dish I'll admit to actually liking--a bit soggy, but again, the flavor was good Stuffed Chicken: surprisingly good; the outside was crispy and the inside with thick and juicy teriyaki chicken: nice sweet/savory glaze and juicy, tender chicken inside Mongo BBQ: light and not overly sauced hot and sour: I have low tolerance for spiciness, so I thought it was a bit too spicy--my mom loved it custard bun: small and delicate--possibly the BEST custard buns I've eaten at a Chinese buffet. Not soggy and not dry--the PERFECT dim-sum quality texture banana "pudding" (in squares): silky smooth, cool, and delicious unlabeled dessert that tasted like banana pudding with a tasty base of banana cake and bananas--it had the "fake" artificial banana flavor that my brother really enjoys unlabeled soft-serve "ice cream" that I strongly suspect was actually frozen yogurt--not watery, but a bit icy as frozen yogurt often is. I loved it, though, being lactose-intolerant and all cantaloupe-fresh!!!! It was actually FRESH!!!!! Oh, the joy of finding fresh fruit at a Chinese buffet  Missing food (that is, what Pacific Buffet has that this place doesn't)  -Crab legs: my mom said they used to have these, but Chinese families would grab 5-6 plates of crabs legs per person, in order to get their money's worth. Personally, I've always found crab legs at buffets to be bland and uninspired -Pineapple RIce -Red bean paste bun shaped like a peach -More sashimi/sushi offerings -frog legs -hard scoop ice cream (green tea amongst other flavors) -sweet dessert soup (with white fungus, gingko nuts, and dates/longan) -BBQ pork buns (actually it might have been Phoenix Palace that used to have this way back when it was a buffet)  Price: $9.99+tax. Best deal EVER.  For the value, City Buffet has the freshest seafood in town. Almost everything was authentic (no overly sauced, greasy, "spicy" Americanized Chinese food here) and that might be the problem. Chinese people like authentic Chinese food, but they would never go to a buffet unless it had expensive items like crab legs and sashimi--otherwise, they can just prepare it at home. I'm afraid this hidden gem might close down or worse, descend to the depths of bad American Chinese. And there's far too much of that already.  4.5 stars (but I'll round up)~shrimp. tuna salmon sushi california roll, tuna-- salad-- beef: coconut shrimp: chicken: chicken: chicken banana " banana banana cake banana ice cream" frozen yogurt-- frozen yogurt peach ice cream ( tea soup ( white pork ~5
-lWLXHxSkvZ7wSs4V9vmwQ~pT43gv8kLwdeoSn6w_XgMA~This place was absolutely the worst buffet I've ever been to.  Honestly, I'm not even a picky eater. Even though I am Chinese, I would not say I'm a Chinese food snob. I firmly believe that amazing Chinese food and dim sum can be found outside of San Francisco and yes, even in buffets. I love myself a good Chinese buffet and have been to much better ones.  BUT, this place is just bad  As a disclaimer, I do not eat seafood, so it was partly my fault for coming here. I can't comment on those dishes, but I can't imagine them being very good based on the other dishes  I started with noodle bowl station. This is really what convinced me to stay here since I love noodles. Well, the wonton were tiny and bland, while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth. The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.  The mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.  They have standard "Chinese" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum. The dim sum buns were hard and these dishes just tasted unappetizing. Blah. The spring roll was especially offensive. The only thing that I enjoyed were the fried wings, which I stuck to after discovering everything else was not good.    Save yourself the trouble and find another buffet if you're hungry.~beef beef beef broccoli, orange chicken ~1

I like my white cotton shirts to look fresh and crisp. Two girls at the counter both said that ladies shirts cannot be laundered, only dry cleaned. Only men's shirts can be laundered. That makes no sense! I said that I would take them somewhere else to be laundered. The girls said "everyone else has the same equipment they won't be able to launder them either." I went directly across the street to DO Summers and asked if I could have the shirts laundered and they said "of course." Is Al Fran Cleaners under new management or why are they so clueless?~white ~1
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~CX6Lo6KjNhhgivYO4xxhGQ~I came here to use their WiFi. I had a chai latte which was fabulous. The staff was very friendly and the coffee shop was mostly quiet I got a lot of work done.~coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~KHFPddz74xni9pKJUplREA~Coffee is fine, foo foo coffees are fine, pastries are fine, teas are fine, ambiance is pretty good with wireless and a nice selection of books to choose from, even location is pretty good. The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers. If you want to own or work in a coffee shop then be ready to screw a smile on your face and show some positive energy.~coffee pastries coffee ~1
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~BkbZql2JXPabeHrnKS3X0A~I usually go to coffee shops to work and Mama Javas is a strong contender in my rotation.  They have free internet and a variety of comfortable seats inside and out.  The coffee is great but the snacks and food leave a bit to be desired.    I enjoy the art they have on the walls which is rotated regularly.  They have regular live entertainment including open Mic Nights which draw quite a crowd.  Even when packed and loud I am still able to find comfort and quiet space to work in the back room.~coffee coffee ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~GJbhF4Kw3r3oV_C4jkAThA~This place is right down the street from my house. It's close and in a great location (small shopping mall with a Zipps).  I really, really want to like this place, but for some reason the Barista's cannot get my order right! I do not like 3 pumps of any flavor in my latte, it's frankly too much flavor. Especially vanilla, it is already strong on it's own. Not sure why all these places claim to have the best coffee and espresso yet mask if with all the sugary flavors! All I ask for is a one pump vanilla latte, that's it! By the time I get to my car to take my first sip, it's ALWAYS WRONG. Guess I should drink it at the table to make sure it's right. I even see the barista write it down on the cup. Hmm not sure the disconnect here.  If you are looking for free wifi and a decent selection, check this place out. Just make sure you bring enough $$ so they don't charge the ridiculous .50 charge for using a card!~coffee ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~dAMZeIvbwPV4ADoDDWq4RA~I have been going to Mama Javas with my daughter  since she was was 9 months old. I love this place. Seriously!  The coffee is awesome, the location is as well. And the big table in the back room is perfect for spreading out a bunch of light plots to review.   I just stopped by earlier last week and saw they had re done the back room a bit, and it had a much better layout.  The food is good, especially the potato knish. I wish they had an actual kitchen, but since they are a coffee shop and not a restaurant, I can give them a pass.  And the live music is great as well, really I wish we had more places like this, but then again, I guess that you shouldn't mess with perfection.~coffee potato coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~5T0vNDbSd8dOpKGiTPH_7A~i discovered this coffee joint after i got a new job in the neighborhood and my addiction to caffeine forced me to start looking around. from the outside, it doesn't look like much, a couple of plain patio chairs and tables, but once you walk in, you'll know this is going to be a regular stop on your way to go anywhere. very nice atmosphere, revolving art pieces over every wall, and my favorite, and actual espresso machine! (unlike the push button machines i find at every starbucks.) the staff is always awesome, and the clientele is very diverse. anyone from the suit and tie on the way to the office, to the hippie getting his morning started, everyones there and seems to be enjoying themselves.  i have to admit i haven't had any of their food yet, and im a creature of habit, so i found a few drinks that i like, and have stuck with them. but their iced coffee is hands down the best ive ever had. its strong but without any acidity. just smooth good tasting coffee. also, their pomegranate green iced tea is so good i didn't drink anything else for months. so if your looking for an alternative to starbucks that has a great atmosphere and even better coffee, give this place a try.~coffee coffee coffee. pomegranate tea coffee, ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~Qx3PaVlWvC8oSD6hYHGLCg~This little coffee house is great. I didn't actually have a coffee, but I definitely enjoyed the pastries they had. There were three different kinds: chocolate dipped coconut macaroon, raspberry and chocolate rugulah. The macaroon was amazing, especially with a tall glass of ice cold milk. I also enjoyed the art that decorated the walls... pretty cool place.~coffee coffee, pastries coconut milk. ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~UmNJJ4alsapj9qnX15hNZw~I will start with the disclaimer that I love independent coffee shops. I'm not a Starbucks girl. So I think I wanted to like Mama Java's better than I actually did.  My co-worker and I headed there one afternoon to do a little work. We walked in and there was nobody there (but it was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday). The barista must have been hard of hearing because even though it was pretty quiet in there we had to repeat our orders several times. But he got them right eventually so I guess that's what really matters. We sat down at a little table near the window and over time the place did start to fill up. But there was just something about the vibe in there that I wasn't feeling that day. I can't put my finger on it but it just wasn't the comfy coffeehouse feeling I'm used to at other places. Maybe it was just what I was working on.  I would go back but I wouldn't rush back. Sorry!~coffee ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~HdRi-OO8cOXPsfJQCgLPbA~I really enjoyed myself here!! I wish mamas was closer to me! The prices are around starbucks but, that's okay. I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas! So awsome! Im not a "hipster" so I wasnt really feeling the atmosphere or did I feel like I fit in (they could work on that) But, I was there to work and enjoy coffee and I did. Bagel was amazing too!~coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~9JZrAD9ul1CXyLq90L8yuw~I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.  The coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!~coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~2BhBAgH3B1c6TW263vF31A~As an out-of-towner, I found this place by accident and was completely thrilled with it.  The Americano was as good as those I find at home and the breakfast sandwiches hit the spot.  In a place where Starbucks seems to be on every corner, it was very refreshing to find such a fine indy coffee place.  The free wi-fi was a great bonus.~sandwiches coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~xHtwncpnBmeBUh2ILaz_rQ~What a delightful little treat! I have wanted to check this place out since I learned about it last summer and finally went. I got there late, so they were closing up shop, but I still had a great experience. My coffee shop benchmark is espresso. If a coffee shop can't get espresso right, then there is no hope that it can get anything else right. But Mama Java's gets espresso right! With just a splash of milk it tantalized my espresso loving taste buds with its smooth, sweet flavor. Like a good coffee shop there was lots of books, art, things to eat, places to sit, etc. This is a place I could spend hours on my laptop or a place to sit and talk philosophy.~coffee coffee milk coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~LnDVJ5WeWr_GolOoG6zgYA~Okay, so I actually like Mama Java's coffee, expect for they looked at me crazy the other day when we asked for cream. Last I checked Cream and Sugar are the coffee standards. Anyway, my problems lies in what has happened in the coffee world. I know there is the big debate between Sbux and smaller privately owned coffee shops. I am the first to admit that yes I prefer the smaller shops. Here is my problem....   Products take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right   This become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly.   Anyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them. For $4 a cup of fancy coffee, I'll go to Crate and Barrell and buy a cappuccino maker and make my own. Yes Mama Java - this liberal elitist knows how to make her own.~coffee, coffee coffee coffee coffee, coffee coffee, ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~9LrFJUHK90IU5YewTjNY9g~Been coming here for a long time.  Coffee is decent, can't speak to the froofy stuff, I stick to boring black.  Generally not too busy (unlike Lux), free wi-fi, great music, plenty of seating with a few not very appealing chairs on the sidewalk outside.  Never pretentious.  They always feature a variety of artists, and offer more local music and open mics than most places.  This place supports Phx artists, makes me happy to support them.~coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~FUluCE23C8XiSUrV49O2pQ~Officially the roo--gaah--laa is very tasty in all 3 flavors.  Chocolate, raspberry and apple cinnamon.  K.~apple ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~Y9Rr78MnWo4MPaxLZTtTKQ~An independent coffee house is Phoenix?  Really?  Yep.  The coffee is okay, but I wouldn't come here for the coffee.  Come here to read a book, people watch, listen to some music, be social.~coffee coffee coffee. ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~QwdlYoMalZ5dEFnzHTvUqQ~This used to be one of my favorite places and the coffee and entertainment are still good, but it hasn't been service with a smile recently.  I've sadly decided to check out the other places in this area (and there are plenty).~coffee ~2
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~oJs6ZmTzULQciCzlhjE87g~Was walking by and really wasn't in the mood for coffee.....but.....something won me over. Don't know if it was that I was just having a 'leisure day' or didn't want to go home and do household chores I've been putting off or the look of the place and that it wasn't busy at all. (I'm going with a combination of all four options with a HEAVY leaning towards not wanting to get home and do chores.) ;-)  So, in I walked and went for an iced mocha. Made quickly and professionally. I almost opted for a rugala....and now I wish I had since several reviews say they are great. Next time....  Like I said, it wasn't busy....nice and quiet....which is good for coffee time. For me, anyway.   Liked the vibe of the place....a few small tables and chairs and a couch...(or two?). There is free wi-fi available.....cool, cool, cool.   They seem to sometimes have live music which if I have a night off may go back for. And they have some breakfast options available too - breakfast sandwiches and omelettes. Nothing too fancy or extravagant but good to know if I'm up early and want breakfast.   Will definitely go back and try it out again.~coffee..... coffee sandwiches ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~g-sXj9IMOnF9uQFCRMdNfA~We wandered in here after walking back to the Zipp's parking lot for vehicle retrieval. I got a delicious peach iced tea that I didn't want to end. However, I just walked half a mile in 100 degree weather, so it had to.  They have adorable little treats for only $.60 each (or 3 for $1.50). The chocolate covered macaroon was by far the best. Much like the elusive "Bon Bon" I feel like I've heard a lot about Macaroons in my life, while never actually tasting one, so I'm glad that changed with Mama Java.  Also, they have a toy sushi set that I really enjoyed. It was among the books. Next to the Mr. Potato Head. I think it was for children, but I'm easily amused so I had a fun time with it.  The only thing I would change is the $.50 surcharge for credit card transactions. But their macaroons are only $.60. I could probably scrounge up that kinda coin from my car any given day, so I'm not too worried about it.~peach tea sushi potato ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~yvqLtL7x0v_00kpjiyKQKg~I'd give MJ's 5 stars if they stayed open later, which they used to do.  It's completely understandable why they don't - they weren't getting the business after 6 to support later hours.  And they tried - live music, amateur poetry (is there any other kind?), art shows, etc.  The coffee is good, the staff can be a bit forgetful but it's more amusing than annoying, it's comfortable, free wifi, lots of space for meetings/studying, lots of natural light (run trolls, run), and they now have a new section of gluten-free baked goods - to my knowledge the only in the area.  As for the credit card service charge - it's never been an issue for me.  I usually carry some cash or can find two quarters in my car and, to be honest, I'd gladly pay an extra half-dollar to drink good joe rather than that burnt swill SBX pushes.~coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~sZls9dMjsWv3Hpjd4gxRLA~I need a 3 1/2 star choice.  Four starts for the coffee, three stars for the atmosphere.    Things I like:  Their coffee: That's important when going to a coffee house.  Accessibility: Lots of parking available.  Local Support:  They had multiply local artist work there to buy including their baked goods.  Things I would work on:  Ambiance: A real bummer of a place.  I just wanted to get my coffee and get the heck out.  It was an environment I wanted to sit and enjoy.  When you think coffee house, you think a place to meet friends, read, relax.  Not here.  It was too quiet, sterile, and the staff need a kick of caffeine themselves and maybe some knowledge on their goods their selling.    So I write this review to let folks know to stop by and definitely grab a cup a joe to go and I also write this to let Mama Java's staff know they should take a lesson from Hava Java up the street when it comes to customer service.  You will never find the coffee spot empty.~coffee, coffee: coffee coffee coffee coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~L7-A1cv2QI6JjvgOvz9vvw~another place that i really like but whose coffee is totally sub par. bitter shots, bubbly milk in my macchiato. good for other kinds of drinks, i'm sure, and i love their book selection and their general seating area. it's very spacious. if you're looking for poetry slams and traditional folk company, this would be the place for you.~coffee milk ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~FPfS0xXUHi36rEgAZ7YZpA~I'm going with Gabi on this one (kiss ass that I am) and raising it one star. I'm all about customer service. And the ladies serving up the joe at yelp office hours were perky and aromatic. Just like the coffee! Just remember. No cell phone at the counter....we don't want Mama Dearest Java Coffee House now do we!? "NO CELL PHONES AT THE COUUUUNNNTTTER!!"~coffee! coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~HWuWpsJu3wyEKEj9HhhBqA~Good coffee. Casual, comfortable ambiance and I had no trouble finding a plug. They have a ton of local products and really yummy bagels and pastries. I don't know that I would continue to go out of my way to go here, but it was definitely not too shabby!~coffee. pastries. ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~5Jhfncd2CmE4EWi5yNC6jQ~My gal and I decided to give Mama Java's a try and I realize why I love Hava Java so much.   Mama Java does have good coffee! If you want a good cup of Joe this could be your place. I guess I have been spoiled by HJ's service.   Mama Java's seems to have a more sterile and less friendly feel to it. It could have just been the time we went, but I had no desire to stay and drink our coffee. The place wasn't as welcoming as our usual hangouts.  Overall the coffee was worth 4 stars, unfortunately the service and atmosphere brought it down a little for me.~coffee! coffee. coffee ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~o-HEvONJ2Mbm-cnxCftTFw~Love this place!  They're so friendly and the coffee is fantastic.  I'm a sucker for Starbucks because of the drive thru... but the more I visit Mama Java's the more I remember just how bad Starbucks really is.  If you haven't visited this place yet, do it!~coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~-ZSBdjRR6BkXV-D4XnU6AA~Don't be fooled -- Mama Java's isn't a coffeeshop; it's actually a secret portal into Eugene, Oregon. Yes, really, right in that funky strip mall on Indian School, next to the Tuesday Morning.   They have it all: hipster baristas, art on the walls, laid-back, slightly funky vibe. They even have the requisite kooky, befuddled, aging hippie behind the counter. He can't quite remember your order, but it's OK, because he's probably going to make you something delicious anyway, and he won't be a dick when you tell him it's the wrong thing.  They've also got that special brand of uppity-ness that you only find in coffeeshops -- you know, the kind that leads the baristas to post handwritten signs forbidding you from using your cell at the counter. Again, it's OK. After all, if you're on the phone while order, you are, in fact, a total fucking douche.   The coffee's pretty tasty and the beans seem fresh, and they have a great setup for studying or working -- even tables in a little back nook that are perfect for groups. Free wifi, of course, and what looked to be a tasty small menu.   Now if only they could transplant some evergreens to block out Indian School Road...then it really would be like Oregon.~coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~IkpBMUuc8ycNdTQZmB7RRg~I can't work at home because the bed always calls my name. So I needed a place to go where it would slightly uncomfortable to sleep at, offered free-wi-fi and possibly have cute boys I can pretend to not stare at.   Mama Java's fulfilled one of my requirements: it was definitely not  a place I could nap at. There are lots of tables, not enough outlets for your laptop and only ONE couch that I wouldn't even think about having drunk sex on. To be fair, this is a coffee shop, not a whore house so ignore my last comment.   What I meant was that it isn't a cozy place, rather cold, actually. I'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups, the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs. I just need a hug at Mama Java's.   There was only one guy at the counter when I was there and a long line but I don't have anything important to get to so I didn't mind the wait. I ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay. Too sugary and strong spices.  I'm actually writing this review as I'm finishing up here at Mama Java's. It's getting cold and I have to go pee really bad, so I have to wrap up this review and head home, which is just down the street. I have a shy bladder.~coffee coffee coffee ~2
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~9WgCeMqhRzGmkpu9Vci1yg~Not a bad local coffee spot.  I had a pretty tasty blueberry muffin here and an iced coffee. Prices were okay and the shop had a very warm and inviting feel to it.  There are always plenty of people around to watch if you need some entertainment.  Or you can always do like I did and bring a book to read- it's a great way to relax!~coffee coffee. ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~lHpmKiJp5laRT-_ySg8kuQ~Exceptionally comfy and attitude-free coffee place. Plenty of evening entertainment, free wi-fi, and the friendliest staff around. Definitely a neighborhood mecca for those of us in Arcadia or the Arcadia-ish area. Meet your neighbors or sit and chill -- free will is the essence of Mama Java.~coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~xPF1ePcrzh_hE45s0TA_Wg~Pretty sweet little spot with nice and bitter espresso and quality artwork on the walls.  Doesn't 'try too hard' to be a hipster joint or to differentiate itself, instead seeming to pride itself on an innate classic-ness.  It seems ridiculous to use such words describing a coffee shop, but coffee seems to have a life of its own when it comes to creating its own subculture, similar to wine.~coffee coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~aFmn03CPcOGCOEIGBOc6ZA~PROS: Coffee quality, espresso quality, Barista skill, Barista friendliness, espresso drink menu is outstanding in terms of options and clever twists, and Layout/design is SUPERBLY inviting and cozy, and its perfectly lit, mostly taking advantage of natural light.  Pleasing mix of live entertainment.  Free Wifi, and 80% of the patrons seem to be using it at any given time for hours on end (coffee shop commuter office).  Middle of the Road:  nothing, really, the elements of this place are either very good (see above) or rather bad (see below).   CONS:  Those damned debit card charges are kind of annoying.  Staff can get overwhelmed at peak times.  Breakfast stuff is fair to slightly-above-average quality, but surprisingly limited for such a popular place.  Location is humble (but convenient), smashed between a scary looking bar and a weird hardware-type retailer.  Probably my third favorite local coffee shop in the valley behind 32 Shea and Coffee Roastery on Hayden (and I've tried dozens and dozens of them), and I definitely beat a path to Mama Java's whenever I'm in the area.~coffee coffee coffee coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~CR-v4u5kTlwvs4QpXGp3Ow~This is my spot. The mature staff members are very refined, like European cafe barista meets Santa Monica cool-cat. Participating in the coffee of the day feature is always fun. I hold most of my professional meetings here and also meet friends here to break up the day. Even the patrons here are way cool. The prices are alright and they support non-profits too, which I like I think is stupendous.~coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~lBBtZcuboE8pRuUWxW7i4g~The pastries are SO good here.  The vibe is comfy.   Did I mention the pastries?  SO good.~pastries pastries? ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~QcUKbZgj0pWWuUTquJW0Ow~It takes forever for them to make a coffee. I have never been overly impressed, and wish that they would offer some gluten-free goodies! I heard that the Terrabite Bakery offers some GF goodies there, but I've never seen it. Although it's a cool atmosphere, I'm not sure I'm impressed enough to go back.~coffee. ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~MZOI6T_oeBNTAtTjxGVzLQ~This place was ok.  It has a real crunchy vibe.  The iced coffee is kind of bitter.  There are interesting people hanging out in there.  I kind of felt like I was intruding on the staff, their conversation seemed more important than serving.~coffee ~3
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~cslsoYX9YMCiwp8op7VIJQ~strongest coffee, pure organic milk and great atmosphere! I dream about the coffee!~coffee, milk coffee! ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~yzorgdiR9trex3VN_XSFFg~Acacia Cafe is, apparently, closed on Sundays. Luckily, Mama Java's is in the same complex so I took my friend to it due to remembering the reviews were positive. The cafe is warm and inviting and we went straight to the eggs speciasl-better luck before 2pm on weekends, folks. The display case had danishes, muffins, bagels and an odd exhibit of bowls with raisin bran already poured into  just ready for milk, I suppose? I went for the potato knish, which was way over priced at 3.25 and since a sign on the sandwich board said "For 50 cents add tomato or cucumber to your bagel...or whatever", I added what were light pink unappealing tomato slices. I ordered a Cafe Mocha soy...and he charged me 50 cents for the soy (ERRRRRR). I wanted at least a fruit cup but there was only a bowl of some bananas, an apple and an orange for the fruit options. My total was like almost 8 bucks-I could have had a full breakfast and coffee at Wildflower Bakery for that amount! The cafe person warned me my knish may be too "peppery". My friend was so hungry she got the ham and cheese sandwich...made with american cheese. No fruit, chips, whatever and a coffee. We sat by the window and perused the lackluster books for browsing (1989 travel guides to Portugal, anyone?) although we did end up on the sofa laughing at Garfield books someone had left.   The prices and quality of food were absurd and I hate being charged 50 cents for soy milk aka the lactose intolerance tax. And since most people are quiet doing work, I felt strange shootin' the shit like we may be annoying people. I don't think I will be back anytime soon.~raisin milk, potato sandwich tomato cucumber tomato apple coffee cheese sandwich ~2
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~okd-x9bMPE5yZU6ZXCSjVg~With a friendly barrista staff, Mama Java's is one of those coffeehouses you immediately feel comfortable at. Good coffee with a nice, unassuming atmosphere, including a real comfy couch which you can sit back and relax on. Free Wi-Fi and live entertainment on most nights (eg. bluegrass on Sundays, open mic on Tuesdays) are big pluses, too.   Definitely a positive attribute to the Arcadia neighborhood.~coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~O9iopumWA-qEl63EGuPvbA~Mama Java...often the highlight of my day!   Ok, so i might be a bit of a caffeine addict and while i am sure that contributes to feeling good almost every time i walk in the door at Mama Java, it is also the coffee and the staff that make me smile.  Best coffee, truly!  Jensy and Billie (the baristas) are sweet, fun, friendly and truly coffee prodigies.  I am sure they will have their very own coffee shop someday soon but for now I am happy to give them my $4.06 everyday like clockwork!!~coffee coffee, coffee coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~nlsJWSyNDv_d6f5j-3GrOg~I popped in here yesterday with my boyfriend to kill some time before going somewhere else. We were there around 5pm and there were only four other people there and two people behind the counter. They kind of left us alone until we were ready to order something, which I really liked. However, we shared a Frozen Mocha and it was just not very good.  I thought it tasted like like the coffee had been burnt, but my boyfriend said it was more likely they used a powder mix instead of real coffee.   Also, it took them almost ten minutes to make this one drink with only 5 people in the entire place--four of which were at different tables talking and reading.   The place itself looks cool and they have a bunch of books if you want to read one, but I didn't want to be there too long since we had somewhere else to be. The drink we got, which was only 16oz was  overpriced for $5.50. Cool and comfortable location, but as of right now Starbucks has better cold drinks, in my opinion.   Maybe we'll go back another time and try something else.    (Edited.)~coffee coffee. ~2
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~V4LlVY0xgoaxDUNaCqkrpg~Was working around the corner and saw this shack at the last minute.  I had to rush out of the house today with no coffee and no Wheaties. It wasn't going to be a hectic day thankfully, but having a giant latte and a bird seed bagel with cream cheese sure would hit the spot.  Thank you my friends!~coffee cream cheese ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~W2pGWnaEWovS6AIWztJEhQ~Was a great joint- I usually go to fair trade coffee down town PHX, and I must say I enjoy here better after 1 trip.

2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~lpoFe1EYRnfBI8s4MKJDGQ~The short: It's all solidly good--the not-too-pricey coffee, the simple pastries, the breakfast sandwiches and knishes, the baristas, and the comfortable and mellow atmosphere when going solo or meeting a few friends.   The long: Located on the southeast corner of Indian School and 36th St., in the strip mall between Tuesday Morning and Darwin's, MJ's is accessible and fairly easy to sign. The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar.   Speaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates.   I usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent café mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality. They also serve one or two different quiches every day, potato knishes, breakfast sandwiches, and omelets.~coffee, pastries, sandwiches coffee coffee coffee tea coffee coffee, tea. mango lemon tea, pastries apple) cookies, potato sandwiches, ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~KfeQorw_j3QioiZ-z7h9Pg~I was thrilled that two places I'd bookmarked from Yelp were in the same strip mall!  After my mani/pedi, I walked down to Mama Java's for an iced coffee.  The inside of this place was very cute -- very funky coffeehouse.    The guy working was a little odd -- very nice, but a little absent-minded.  I asked for an iced coffee and he got me hot coffee.  I told him I wanted it iced and he was like, "oh yeah!  Right!"  I got my iced coffee with sugar free hazelnut syrup.  It was really delicious, and really pretty reasonably priced.  It was one of the better iced coffees I've had.  Not a Starbucks fan (it always tastes burnt), so I'm always on the lookout for new places.  I like supporting the smaller, independent coffee houses anyway -- they seem to have a better vibe, and it's always a good idea to support small businesses.  Even though the guy working was a little odd, I will definitely be back.  Good prices and great product!~coffee. coffee coffee. coffee coffee ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~-pU8YkzkI82exi4sTLgzAQ~New in town, I had heard nothing but good things about Mama Java's, so since I live half a mile up 36th, I decided to walk down and try it for myself. I walked in and was immediately introduced to a warm, welcoming atmosphere. A very popular place, there were many people, and there was still ample seating. As I approached the counter, I had asked a friendly employee what they would recommend. As soon as she had asked if I liked chocolate, I quickly nodded in confirmation. I didn't have to wait very long for preparation of my soy mocha, which tasted truly outstanding. I highly recommend Mama Java's Coffee House, it's very well worth the price...SO much better than commercially owned coffee houses like Starbucks.~coffee coffee ~5
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~T0-ENYb9m9g0fuiG_BZvCg~Discovered this gem on a Friday afternoon. Great Latte. Cool Kick back down to earth staff. More comfortable vibe than any coffeehouse in Seattle I've been to. Great of them to have the Heather Hill Photo showing for Provety Pets going on when I stopped in. I was able to browse the photos and then order without feeling I had to.   They could use a few more flavors for their coffee drinks though, I like butter rum and butterscotch if you;re reading. For the moment it;s not walking distance for me but I consider it a great neighborhood spot.~coffee butter ~4
2O_ec-By_tho2KeXvcnBuQ~OU8tgLYNmY8SG_OiUEK_SQ~If you want a coffee house that makes coffee like its their own personal artwork, this is the place.  Great service, great atmosphere and most importantly, great coffee that is made how it is supposed to be made.  on the comments about the .50 credit card charges...obviously these people have no clue how expensive it is to have a credit card machine and how much each transaction costs.  It is hard for mom and pop shops to survive in the world of greed lusting chains.~coffee coffee coffee ~5
6NczdpOqzGQ7_Sgc_VHA0A~Sa8XmYtarClsn0MPZCsJLA~River Island is one of my favourite clothing stores that I like to visit. This store is large and sells a range of Men clothing as well as womens. I like the up to date modern designs on the clothes, they could make mens designs more interesting instead of plain white tops and black v-neck tops. I really like the shoe range as for it is modern looking and unique. The prices of the clothes is rather expensive, like a t-shirt could be 25.00 pounds for a plain white top, which isn't really worth it. But sometimes they have nice items, depending on the season. The quality I would say is good.~date white white ~4

2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~nr6HVj403qT3UxjGevK_Hw~It's really close to my workplace, so it gets attention from me.  Chicago Deli is very much a deli... fresh meats and lettuce and tomatos go a long way.  Service is moderately quick and prices are middle of the road.  One highlight is the Romanian.  Great Salami sandwich with a slightly different sauce.  First place I've had this particular combo.  I've eaten it once, and I'll eat it again!~lettuce salami sandwich ~3
2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~Lq3YwAAKSgAfZJayBbcOpA~I ate here because I didn't have a car and I had nowhere else to go to get some food. The restaurant looked normal but the options weren't very appealing to me.  I was reluctant at first but I ended up getting a sandwich and a bowl of chili.  It wasn't amazing but it did the trick.     If I stay at the hotel again I'll probably eat here just for a quick bite before I got out but I'd rather travel a few miles to find something better.~sandwich ~3
2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~Zk_9NU_bDGSBLPt_TwP8xg~PATHETIC... The waitress slammed my coffee on the table, gave me no creamer or sweetener, I still said thank you as she rushed off. I tried to get her attention as she ran around like a chicken with her head cut off. She was obviously in the weeds, but that's no reason to slam down guests food and drink. She was obviously unhappy which made me unhappy and unwanted... So I left and will NEVER go back!!~coffee chicken ~1
2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~2LbN13BSJnU1APJei0OhNQ~I know we're in the midwest, but we experienced some of the slowest service ever at the Chicago Deli, to the point where our neighbors at the table next to us said, "I don't think she's ever coming back!" I'd say give yourself 15 more minutes than you expect to need if staying in house.  Pastrami did the trick, though. Now I remember why I miss the midwest!~pastrami ~3
2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~wDbPOxMqMtfl-asfBF71Nw~If you love Corned Beef Sandwiches, This is the place to go.  FRESH SLICED Corned Beef.  They make different sandwiches with corned beef.  But these are the best I have had.  They have other food, but I don't ever get the other food... lol I eat there everytime I am at the Cleveland Clinic. It is worth the stop for lunch.~corned beef ~4
2TVZb3GdY6XvX88jbOofIg~6d2lruOSkrRAwyT57NnkGg~Nice little Chicago style deli located by the Cleveland Clinic.  The place gets busy at lunch, but their sandwiches are big! The staff is courteous, but rarely refill your drink. You pay up front when you're done.~sandwiches ~3
6ioGGhiSRG0T-Z7NvJ-sXA~Nw7HjouPu60yBLeRC6ZJzw~I'm going to attempt a twisted metaphor in my review, pitching The Ale House as the Gregg's sausage roll of pubs. A hostelry that performs its role admirably, yet apparently has few pretensions towards fashion or changing tastes. As you descend the rickety stairs to the toilets there's something a bit dirty about the whole experience, with greasy graffiti adorning the walls. But if this is what you were looking for, an instant hit of gratification, you'll find few better examples.  The beers on offer are standard fare, with a guest ale or two on tap. During the festival at least there's a mixed clientele of young and old, but I'm sure The Ale House is welcoming enough at any time of year.~sausage instant ~3
6ioGGhiSRG0T-Z7NvJ-sXA~Gj-MtQEpOjV0t4KTigrDqQ~Women eeh!! {see reviews below} - this is a pub, it shows sport, serves beer, pork scratching and scampi fries!  Like a well known brand it does what it says on the tin! Would I go back with a mixed group of friends - probably not! Would I go back for a pint and to watch the footy to avoid having to hear 'Tarquin' saying its just not cricket.... - yes!  No ayres and graces, no non-sense, friendly staff! Seems fair to me.~sport, pork scampi fries! ~3
6ioGGhiSRG0T-Z7NvJ-sXA~REoYltCRcXekMfLV21XRuQ~"Let's get a drink!"  "Ok!" "Um...where?" "Next door!" "Yes, go!"  So went the general conversation at Kampong Ah Lee after our yelp get-together meal. All hailing from completely different parts of the city, we just wanted somewhere close that sold drink, and you can't get anywhere much closer than next door.  I have to admit I wouldn't have normally stopped in here, or gone out of my way to. It's an old man pub, which I think attracts mainly said old men and students. There were lots of students, huddled around tables eating lots of packets of chocolate biscuits with their pints. Awh, bless.  But the bar staff were friendly, easy going and didn't mind a crowd of us around the bar despite that there were ample free seats. The tv screens are obviously an appeal as almost every man I spoke to (Chris M, Jurgen D, Joe A, Andrew...I'm looking at you all!) got that distracted, distant-look of "ooo shiney moving things on a flat screen" look more than once.  There's a lot of old man boozer's on Nicholson Street. This was 8pm on a Tuesday evening. It was pleasant enough, I think mainly down to the company. It wasn't my cup of tea, but I didn't experience anything particularly terrible here. Although I didn't use the toilets or stay past 9pm...~tea, ~2
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~_QuDbY-SMIesgVoReDmfPA~For a chain, the food at Zizzi is excellent. The menu changes with the seasons and includes a good range of dishes including traditional pastas and pizzas as well as meat and fish dishes, with a good range for vegetarians too. The restaurant is rather open plan and, if sitting downstairs, you can see the chefs hard at work with their huge pizza oven. The staff are friendly but the restaurant can lack atmosphere if there aren't too many diners. When it's busy the service can be slow, but this is perhaps only to be expected. Worth a visit for a tasty and reasonably priced Italian lunch or dinner if in the area.~pizza ~4
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~ecj13WojAvGgq5QU_jyHqw~yes, zizzi is a chain but there is nothing wrong with giving a chain restaurant a good review if they provide good service and tasty food.  this is exactly what this zizzi did for eight hungry people on this past friday night.   after being told we couldn't order food in hyde out (for reasons unknown to us as the cook was clearly making food in the kitchen) we headed to the next closest option and lucky for us it was this zizzi.  we we first came in the waiter that greeted us seemed a bit put out that there were eight of us for a table without reservations (although they were only moderately busy with empty tables available).  luckily for us the guy set a table anyway and we were shown to it with our drink orders taken by a lovely and friendly waitress.  i really have to compliment the waitress on her service for us.  she was lovely and polite and helpful the entire time, checking on us after the food arrived but not constantly being around or disappearing for long lengths of time.  after such poor service at hyde out i was really pleased that this girl was so attentive and friendly, well done to zizzi for hiring her!  the food was also very lovely.  we had an assortment of garlic breads to start, my favourite being the tomato with pesto although the garlic bread with cheese was also quite tasty.  i had a rustica pizza for my main with auberinge, rocket, olives, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms (which i'd subsituted for the peppers) drizzled with pesto.  it was awesome!! and the perfect thing to line my tummy for the drinks to come in the night ahead.  i also shared a really lovely sauvigon blanc that was fruity and fresh and so enjoyable :)  so yes a chain restuarant, but this place had good quality food and good service.    it's a bit of a shame that it's tucked away behind cargo but this didn't seem to stop people from finding it.  so well done zizzi for proving that chain restaurants can also provide a lovely and tasty meal.~garlic breads tomato garlic cheese pizza mushrooms ( ~4
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~FyQqgWS-JPxVg5Jw9L7X1A~Zizzi's is an often overlooked Italian restaurant group, particularly with the dominance of this area by Pizza Express.  I visited their restaurant on Fountain Quay a couple of year's ago, and had a very enjoyable evening.  The location is the first aspect of this restaurant that is striking.  It is situated at the canal basin that marks the end of the Union Canal, which links Edinburgh to Falkirk.  This area was developed relatively recently, and befits the fashionable image that people would now associate with the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh.  The building that houses the restaurant is primarily glass in construction, and this affords diners a great view of the canal basin and the moored boats.  The food is particularly good.  Prices are comparable to its competitors, and the quality of the food is great.  I was there as part of a large group, and never at one point did I feel that anything was taking too long, or did I impatiently have to catch the eye of the waiting staff.  The kitchen feels like part of the restaurant, and if you're looking hard enough, you can actually see your meal coming together.  This is a great restaurant.  It's a shame that it doesn't get more attention, and I would recommend it as a great meal out along the same lines as Pizza Express.~pizza pizza ~4
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~bpeCtCd0UnQ5Xah37VMY3Q~I wouldnt say I was overly impressed with this place, I went when it was not long opened though so it may have changed. I went at the weekend for a meal with my boyfriend and was surprised at the casualness of the place for a weekend evening. The menus were quitr good and its just normally priced like most other Italians. the menu consists mostly of pizza and pasta, the pasta I had was very nice but we waited quite a while and the service was generally just ok. The thing that spoilt it for me was that all the waiting staff had on jeans and thier own clothes so it was hard to tell who to ask for things and none of them seemed to be very well trained, a bi disappointing as it is in a nice new development along the Union Canal and could be so much better than it is.~pizza pasta, pasta ~2
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~Z2jI4qP-kZbOLDr18ljELQ~For all of Edinburgh's numerous qualities, it sorely lacks a good, authentic pizza establishment.   Sad but very, very true.   Saying this, Zizzi, in my opinion, is definitely the best of what's on offer. Very thin, crisp bases and a wide range of gourmet styled toppings make this a place you can come and enjoy your £10 pizza.  ...and yes, you can get takeaway!~pizza pizza ~3
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~KiADu6ioJb2EQP9h8DlCQQ~I went here on Saturday to meeting with the only people that I would generally goto such a place with, with my Parents, sister, brother in law and their two kids. This is because if I'm eating out - I want to go somewhere special (preferably somewhere that does beer) and also because they were paying, I was pretty much ok with it.  Food is good. Pretty wheat heavy. Pizza, pasta, garlic bread etc - luckily I'd just been out on a long ride so was feeling like I deserved it.  I had some weird half calzone. It was good though! There is a lot of spice going on in their stuff sometimes though which I'm not 100% happy with. Sometimes it just seems to be a bit OTT.   However the staff are great, they don't mind kids, it's big enough that I don't mind the fact that there are kids, and it's in a central location.   So - basically - good for a quick lunch etc, but I ain't taking a date here.~wheat pizza pasta, garlic date ~4
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~UxiTLwSAad93O9EbEBXU8A~Zizzi is one of those places you never really plan on going to. I've recently had to relocate to the Fountain Court apartments that sit across the canal from here and we decided to grab some food. We had our 2 month old in tow and the short distance appealed...  I can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute of the Zizzi experience (in the past I've never been that fussed). The pasta was super fresh and full of flavour, the staff were amazingly helpful and they even had some guest Italian beers on, which for a chain shows a nice commitment to choice.  It'll never be a world beater, but don't rule out Zizzi for a decent Italian  meal.~pasta ~4
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~PMgl29BOA3UYKu9b7KOpAw~Zizzi's is a chain restaurant but is pitched further up the market than most chains. It is owned by the same people as Pizza Express and Ask restaurants and offers reasonably priced Italian food. They often offer '2 for 1' meals to boost business which means it becomes great value (given most main courses are sub-£10 anyway). The pizzas are excellent and you can watch them being cooked in the wood fired oven in the restaurant. The pastas and risottos can be more hit and miss however with the focus on heavier sauces (it can be a bit much at lunchtime!). The menu changes regularly and there is a wide choice of types of pasta and a good selection of vege dishes. The service is good and is usually pretty quick which, along with the '2 for 1' offers, makes it a good work lunch option.~pizza pasta ~3
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~Kjs-qs_CQ5e9OKNTGCULag~Recently visted Ocean Terminal and chose Zizzi to dine in before going to the cinema upstairs. The view is lovely out in to the harbour however we were seated to the back because it's so busy (which was a good sign) casual atmosphere (staff wearing jeans and uniformed top) Had never been to this particular Italian chain before and so was unsure of what to expect; ordered the dough sticks to share as starter, ideal as its actually quite a large portion which is nice, would have preffered butter as opposed to the mayonaise but other than that it was a good start. Ordered the house wine which wasn't the best but fairly cheap at £3.00 glass.main course however was not satisfactory at all; chicken and mushroom pasta bake, pretty sure the sauce was either dated or from a tin, very similar to the consistency of soup! Also couldnt eat it for the first five minutes as it was too hot from having been in the oven. Friend ordered the meat calazone, dough was lovely and thick however the whole meal was really hot (spicey)...perhaps better suited to those with a liking for spicey food- jalapenos in every forkful! Over all i would say the service was good, and if you are looking for a basic meal before cinema like myself it is ideal, not sure i personally would go back though~butter chicken mushroom pasta soup! ~2
HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw~jvAA6Qmk8KgRt42EGPyZSg~One of the well established brands in the UK, Zzizi is anf Italian chain of restaurants. It is located by the canal which on a sunny day makes it a much preferred destination for locals. It is also close to Cargo bar which offers a big open space of tables outside. Zizzi has a limited area of tables outside which could have its drawbacks too - not being offered a good view and a table in the fresh air. Service is very good, compare to some of Pizza Express restaurants, and their menu is quite diverse. One of the best things about the food is that it is made on the spot and you could watch how it has been cooked.~pizza ~3
6m82IjcZEp72P-PVQijElA~WObSi70ezSkV5XUYQy4ypw~Due to iffy weather plus wanting to have a few drinks, we chose to stay over at the Hampton Inn following a company Christmas party at the hotel.  The banquet space was nicely decorated. We had apps and drinks in the lounge before dinner -- good nibblies. Dinner portions were on the small side but everything was quite tasty. Not 5-star dining but pretty good for hotel catering (on par with or better than weddings I've attended, for example). The servers were friendly and bilingual and kept things moving nicely.  Our room on the 4th floor with king-sized bed was quiet and comfortable. I turned off the heater/fan as it was a bit noisy during the night.   A full breakfast was offered in the morning (included in the price of the room). There was a really wide selection including scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries and bake-your-own Belgian waffles, fresh fruit, cereal, porridge, toast, ... Not haute cuisine but much superior to the usual hotel brekkie of weak coffee and a packaged muffin.  We had a quick swim after breakfast in the indoor pool, which was clean but no showers -- bring a coverup or something to get back to your hotel room so you can change out of your wet swimsuit.  Definitely a comfy place to stay.~sausage coffee ~4
6m82IjcZEp72P-PVQijElA~5Be987EXtOO85kht9pAn6A~Ok let's start with why do they serve baked beans for breakfast? Yes I ate them and don't get me wrong I liked them just found it odd.  Now I really enjoyed my stay including the different front desk people.  At one point I wanted to order food for delivery and the gentleman at the front desk ordered it in French and it showed up perfect.   The room was clean the folks here made me feel welcome other than a plumbing issue it was a wonderful stay.  Ok I mentioned that I was lactose intolerant and the staff, Susan and Mireille gave me almond milk.  Upgraded one star.~almond milk. ~5

Everything tastes reheated (which it is). Pancakes were hard as rocks. Bacon was tasteless and paper thin. Soggy toast. Not the best way to kick off your morning. That said, atmosphere and staff are nice.  This is simply a review of their buffet breakfast please take into consideration this is a pizza joint.  Keep working at it guys.

5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~_yjJPUEb3ORLqCf5SnNRBA~This has to be my new favorite fried seafood joint for sure. The price is right and the portions are big. I had the 6 piece fried shrimp and it was excellent. The shrimp were huge and seemed like tiger prawns to me. The breading was flavorful and they make their own cocktail sauce. I got corn and slaw as my sides. The corn was good but the slaw was great.   The staff was very friendly. I was greeted right when I walked in. The lady that took my order explained the menu to me and talked about the restaurant. It's a family owned place based out of Louisiana and this is their first and only location in az. I'm just glad it's by my house because I will frequent here often.   Can't wait to go back and eat and take my wife there. Go give it a try, you won't be disappointed.~shrimp shrimp corn corn ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~_TbtZCcCcKaCioY0TRwLbA~I'm kinda sad, I went all the way over here and ordered the 8 piece fried oyster combination and I neglected to get cocktail sauce with my oysters, which would have been the pièce de résistance for my delicious, hot and crispy fried oysters!  Instead I opted for malt vinegar...stupid me!  My oysters were cooked to perfection and my sides, fried okra and buttered corn, were delicious and hot too.  The 8 piece meal was a little over $15, but it didn't come with a drink, so it's a little bit pricey if you aren't even getting a drink, but aside from the drink issue the food is a decent value and the service was friendly.    I'd also like to mention that the restaurant was scrupulously clean and my to-go meal had a couple of Dentyne mini packs of peppermint gum thrown in, which I thought was a nice touch since NOBODY wants to have post-lunch oyster breath, amiright?~okra corn, ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~qrHt_h1V03mxTdi6RxX8Jg~We came here tonight after seeing a few glowing recommendations from Facebook friends.  I am from the east coast and therefore very skeptical of any local 'seafood'.  I am SO GLAD I tried this place!!!  Everything was amazing,  including the service from Will.  He went way above and beyond his duty and made our experience even more amazing than the shrimp!  We will DEFINITELY be back!    I just wish they were open on Sundays...~shrimp! ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~uGV5kGwf0ec3uMEQWhMvpQ~After watching the food network channel, my bf and I suddenly wanted fried seafood. We considered Long John Silvers, Pete's Fish & Chips, but wanted to try something new. After looking through Yelp, Good Guys Seafood stood out because they had good reviews and they were located pretty close to home and it was something new. The restaurant is very clean, bright, and spacious. We were greeted by a super nice and sweet lady behind the counter named Yolanda. The previous posts are true, she's super nice and very helpful. We got the fried oyster po boy and the 3 fried fish and shrimp plate. The food was really good, it came out piping hot and fresh out of the fryer.  I have to say that their fried shrimp was AMAZING! They were really big (we were pretty impressed), perfectly cooked, cleaned and de-veined, crispy, great flavor! I now know where to come when I want fried shrimp. The shrimp was seriously so good and everyone should go try some! The price for the food was very reasonably priced. Yolanda came and checked on us to see how everything was. Their fish was battered with corn meal and was really good. Their portion size is really good, and they gave me an extra fish and shrimp I think because it was my first time there. I would definitely recommend this place!~chips, fried fish shrimp shrimp shrimp. shrimp corn shrimp ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~pz_NrA9t-gHIxGisj6wLew~Best inexpensive Seafood in this part of town. Found it by using the nearby button on my phone and came here that same day. Located in a large strip mall right on the corner. Look for a place with a banner and several colorful posters of the food specials in each window.  They have Fish, Oysters, Shrimp, Chicken, Burgers, Philly Cheese Steaks and more. You can even order a Salad and load it up with with some of the proteins mentioned above. They also have several fried appetizers as well as some really good side dishes. The Coleslaw is really good and taste like my recipe. Great value and large portions.  Really like the Catfish and Shrimp. You can get them fried or grilled. The fried Oyster plate is also very tasty and a favorite of mine. You definitely have to try the Catfish, Shrimp or Oyster Po-Boys. Reminds me of what we used to get when we would stop at these tiny roadside shacks while traveling along the gulf coast in LA and MS.  Service is extremely friendly and you will see very quickly as you enter the restaurant. This also has to be one of the cleanest restaurants I have seen in a long time. It is nice to know they care about the customers and a big reason for my high rating. ENJOY!  5 STARS~shrimp, chicken, burgers, cheese steaks salad appetizers coleslaw shrimp. shrimp ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~Rpw--4LY4jJNk9XIf2CuUA~We were looking for a good sea food place and turned to YELP to find out what was in the local area. After reading reading all of the excellent reviews we decided on the Good Guys Seafood. What a disappointment! We ordered the oysters, shrimp, and fish. The fish had absolutely no texture, the batter had a bitter taste, the oysters were nothing like previous reviewers stated they were. I've been to the SE part of the US and believe me these fried oysters were not even close to those I had in Louisiana and Mississippi. The shrimp was nothing special. Won't eat there again. Makes me wonder however about the limited experience and taste other reviewers had. The cocktail sauce was watery, the tarter sauce appeared to be mixed with thousand island dressing.~shrimp, shrimp thousand island dressing. ~1
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~yL0tOb2FpqPeV8XUGH_QMA~This is by far the best seafood joint in Mesa.  Good fish, large portions, quick service, great prices!  They have boneless chicken wings too that are quite yummy - try the parmesan ones.  Those whiners who gave this place a two star rating - I have no clue where they are coming from.  This is Arizona - you are not going to get seafood like you get in New Orleans or Boston or San Diego here - duh!  This place does a great job, the food is real yummy.  Their battered oysters are a bit thick, but where else can you get an oyster Po Boy in Mesa?  I go to this place at least once, and sometimes twice, every week.  Way better than Pete's...~chicken ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~t4kdTFKxPQttFGq_Mra3Qg~I went in their for a quick meal, I have no problem with the main part of the dishes, they were actually quite good. The grilled fish and shrimps were great. I did on the other hand have a problem with the side, I had the green beans and coleslaw. I can easily tell the green beans were from a can and just heated up. I don't know if the coleslaw was fresh, but it was ok.~shrimps green beans coleslaw. green beans coleslaw ~3
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~iNlKGNiuH4mUeCZ9HdQ2pw~Clean resturant, but fish was undercooked, fries were good, cole slaw was the best. Very low traffic, will not return, because of under cooked food and counter help was unfriendly.~fries ~2
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~o301DIP1gIiphxQoxygOkw~Very clean place!  I got the fried fish and shrimp combo and was very surprised at the size of the shrimp and the fish were nice size fillets as well.  My sides were a hearty helping of fries and a good cole slaw.  My only complaint is the shrimp sauce, it tasted like ketchup mixed with gasoline.  Easy fix though, I had horseradish and ketchup in the fridge.  I also made my own tartar sauce as theirs' looks more like thousand island dressing.  I will definitely continue visiting this place, I'll just order smaller meals as the portions are large.  So nice having some decent fish in the area at a reasonable price.  They use catfish for their fried fish.  I met another return customer while there and he raved about the fried oyster po' boy.  Guess I'll have to give that a try!~fried fish shrimp shrimp fries shrimp horseradish thousand island dressing. fried fish. ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~YvC-mukvvlyCwRNn11vwRw~I got the three fish and three shrimp the last week. (Fired)  Shrimp was ok, fish was really good. Today we got two of the three fish meals, was over cooked. Not sure if we will go again. Both times the meals were take out.~shrimp shrimp ~2
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~B4jPF5tGgYUV0xfvXny54g~I'd been seeing the sign for this place for a couple of months but thought it was a Seafood Market. Then I drove past it from the Southern Ave. side and realized it was an eatery. It's located in the former Kyoto Bowl location at Country Club and Southern. I stopped in to ask info just as they were closing a couple weeks ago and came back yesterday to try them out.   I found out they had an Oyster Po ' Boy sandwich and ordered it with a side of mac and cheese in place of the fries. A drink even came with the $6.99 price. I really enjoyed the sandwich, good flavor, fresh ingredients. The mac and cheese was a bit mushy but had good flavor and they were generous with the portion. I ate half my meal there and had half left for a second meal. The server, Bailey, was extremely nice and helpful in answering questions. We share a love of fairies! I hope to get back to try the shrimp and fish before I leave town.   This place conveniently located near many motels in the 60 & 87 area. There is a large parking lot right in front.~sandwich mac and cheese ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~jP5vjzTUrFSvmukrka3Lag~Awesome awesome awesome and the amount of food they give u its just incredible. I love the shrimp and fish not to mention the price. I hardly eat seafood in restaurants because how stingy they are with the quantity of food but I will diffently come to this place when I crave seafood.~shrimp ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~RqZOLHHKd_6FNZ2uerOf_w~Needed a quick lunch to go and I stopped in randomly. I was quickly greeted by the manager who made the suggestion I try a few of the specials. I placed my order for 2 Fish and Shrimp- Fried. The owner was present in the kitchen, which I thought was a good sign. Food came fairly quickly. I was given several different sauces to try and sent on my way. The fried fish was clean, but nothing special. The shrimp were huge and awesome. Hush puppies were soggy and not cooked well, as were the fries. One  special came with slaw, which I did not taste. The sauces proved to be very interesting. Cocktail was spicy and tangy. Tartar was pinkish and chunky. Hot sauce was normal. Overall, I am not sure that I would visit this establishment again- but I do wish them the very best of luck!~fried fish shrimp fries. ~2
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~zKsJsZ-UlU45UDdFacAXtQ~All I can say is, SO DELICIOUS!  I ordered the lunch special with the shrimp po'boy, fries, and a drink for around $6.50.  I took it to go, and it was still piping hot when I got back home 15 minutes later.  When I opened the container, fries came tumbling out, it was packed FULL!  I set them aside, and unwrapped the po'boy.  It was full of 3 large shrimp, fried crispy golden brown, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and sauce.  The bread was soft and fresh.  I added a little Louisiana Hot sauce and dug in!  It was amazing!  Such fresh flavors.  The fries were done perfectly, crisp on the outside, moist on the inside.  The iced tea is fresh brewed and nice and strong!   Don't let the location keep you away.  The restaurant was immaculately clean, well lit with ample seating.  The young lady at the counter was pleasant and quick to get orders out when they came up.  Even when she was waiting for orders to be done, she was tidying up and making sure the restaurant was the way it should be.  A big plus was that she emptied the trash and IMMEDIATELY washed her hands even though she had an order up.  The orders are served in a closed container, but she still took the time to make sure her hands were clean.  You would think that would be a given, unfortunately it isn't. A wonderful dining experience and I can't wait to share this restaurant with my family!~shrimp fries, fries shrimp, brown, lettuce, tomato, pickles, fries tea ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~KzDXMUlkS-qgjFMpi4BDBw~Have had lunch here on several occasions and have always been impressed. Grilled fish and shrimp always fresh and tasty. French fries were very good and serving so large that it is hard to finish. Service had alway been very friendly and they go out of way to make certain that you have a great visit. Chicken tenders may be the best I have ever had.~shrimp french fries ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~7FNF-1dLPo32z1h0dseUXg~Fantastic catfish! I got the 2 fish 2 shrimp special grilled with fries! It was a lot of food but it was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it!! Staff was friendly. When I went it was completely empty in the restaurant! But amazing food!! I will definitely be going back!(:~shrimp fries! ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~VarIycyRGgyzfo82QmnACA~My husband and I have been here once...I got the Talapia w/okra and he got the 4 piece fish w/fries and coleslaw.  It took awhile to get our food but we didn't mind and at least knew items hadn't been precooked. There was more than enough food and we brought home a lot, partially because the tarter sauce was so bad....not sure what is in that orangey colored stuff, but it taste bad.  We both thought the fish tasted bad.  Next day we heated up the left overs and used our own tarter sauce...what a difference! Good Guys would do much better if they would upgrade their tarter sauce.  I doubt that we're the only ones who blamed the poor taste on the fish. Had we of not reheated and used our own tarter sauce the next day we would have never returned, but as it stands now, we will but will take our own tarter sauce.  One more thing, it would be nice to have ketchup on the table, and possibly decent eating utensils...not just a flimsy fork...guess I can take that with me next time.~coleslaw. ~3
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~ysZzlY5aooFVYUQUNXDuCA~A great treasure. You must try the home made Coleslaw. You can always tell quality food. The service was very fast and friendly. Not too many places have fried Oysters. The fried Okra is worth the drive. They have something for everyone. I have been there twice and still have several more items to try.~coleslaw. okra ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~ZpCYtVJaszbNLSw_5vv6AA~This is my favorite seafood restaurant in Mesa. Great prices, excellent food. I love the fried shrimp & grilled fish. Honestly, I'm not a fan of their side dishes, however the fried okra is really good. The staff is always friendly. The restaurant is always clean.~shrimp & okra ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~B20zttWgaBiMLz8knZjzeg~So, I had the "3 Piece Fried Fish & Fries " Ok let me first off say this. I debated for a long time on giving this place a One Star or a Two Star. So they call it "Fish" on the menu they don't say what kind it is so I asked them he said "Catfish" I honestly think it's "Swai Fish".  Swai Fish is another  white fish that similar  to Catfish but taste a little different. But when food is fried it's hard to tell the difference between the two especially if you don't eat fish a lot. So I honestly think they don't put the name of the fish on the menu so they wont get in trouble for false advertising. But anyway on to the Taste of the fish. It had no real favor in the cornmeal it had a little salt but no real favor. The fries were cold and given the fact that you have to wait 7plus minutes for them to cook the fish you would think you would get fresh fries too. The one positive thing I will say about this place is the services was nice & very friendly. I really doubt if I would go back.~fried fish & fries " white fries fries ~2
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~AU66Qfz2HFXTF7dGVG9X0A~Had a coupon in my circular & kids thought we should give them a try! Kids were right food was good! Fish was seasoned & so were the hushpuppies. French fries were ok but the prawns and fish were a big hit at our house. Will be coming back soon!~french fries ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~AjAoic_4iv3dMDo6XoDDoA~Took the Missus out for a lil seafood at Good Guys.  She was concerned with the neighorhood and once inside all fears subsided.  Pin neat and clean with a super friendly young lady at the counter.    We had Shrimp Po Boys with oysters and shrimp on the side. I would the shrimp are extra large 24/30.  Freshly battered and no frozen pre-prepared.   Huge oysters in a cornmeal breading.   We stuffed ourselves for $20. Its a chain out of Lousiana and it shows!!!   Got to give this one a try.~shrimp shrimp shrimp ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~eUJJdU729TF9oMnUFYP_1g~Saw this place driving by a few times. Finally decided to stop by and of my was I glad. I purchased the 4 Fish and $ Shrimp. Must i say, it was way too much food. I had to take it home and have it for dinner also. The fried fish was very tasty and the special tarter sauce made it even better! Jumbo Shrimp!!! Will be back VERY soon. Keep up the good work!~shrimp. fried fish shrimp! ~5
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~0G7Q6XLHkeLWaOgfNO1KhA~Love the Louisiana-style fried oysters here (#14) - eight plump juicy molluscs in cornmeal batter, deep-fried to perfection. I ordered fries and slaw as sides; fries were good, the slaw was just OK. The hush puppies that came with the order were on the dense side. I'm definitely coming back to try the fish and other tempting items on the menu.~fries fries ~4
5RZt_9lrBSNDuzCyV1zPMw~oI-GyGp8OoERvWtkgTTUtw~My wife and I ate here today. We are from Maryland and always took seafood for granted until we moved out here to the desert. Not many places in the Phoenix area have good seafood at a reasonable price. I had the oysters, they were large and very good. I tried the cocktail sauce and the tarter sauce. I really loved the tarter sauce. It was unique and very good. My wife had the philly steak sub. It was so big that she only ate half and will save the other half for later. It came with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and mayo. It was very good. The fries that came with it were cooked perfectly and very good. The prices are good too. This will be a regular place for us.~steak bell mushrooms fries ~5
1rfRNfPT-uocY2XfdBO8SQ~hmebup9rsy5fcmdHVFb0XQ~This review is for the cafe on the ground floor at the rear that fronts onto Rose Street. I am here to advise you to never, ever, in all of your long-legged life, buy food and eat it here. It's that bad. We ordered fish and chips and they were cold and composed of mostly skin with a little bit of cold, rubbery fish attached. The potatoes were also cold. The peas were cold. Getting an impression yet? It was also really cold in the cafe as the temps were low on the day we visited and the doors to the place opened and closed right onto the street, causing the place to be like unto a fridge. So yeah, don't eat here. You'll be out £14.50 with the drinks and you won't be able to eat it.~chips peas ~1
1rfRNfPT-uocY2XfdBO8SQ~eO8ZNF6asKmOE0V9x60RNQ~Bhs still seems to me to be a bit of a relic although they seem to have improved themselves recently by putting in the new cafe area at the front of the store so shoppers can have a coffee as they watch the world go by.  For so long bhs has seemed to cater for the viscose jumper-loving shopper and it still appears to be a bit behind the times. They bring out a really naff load of christmas gear and mark it down weeks before christmas as well which strikes me as a desperate sales pitch. And their poor staff are made to try and flog you the hugely over-priced store cards at every opportunity. It is the type of place I only go to to get novelty sock or ties as a joke gift.~coffee ~2
1rfRNfPT-uocY2XfdBO8SQ~kYg4KzhBTXsTbqWMZvC2jA~Where to have a breakfast in the New Town? Don't have it at the BHS restaurant on Rose Street! They advertise breakfasts at £1.99 but you must buy a drink. The drink is £2.55! Totally unacceptable sharp practice. On top of all that they did not have any eggs ready to serve and the bacon was overdone. A total waste of money made worse by the dreary restaurant itself. Functional and dull. Even the toilets are out of easy reach up a steep staircase. The one star is only due to the sympathetic staff who were serving. Go anywhere else if you are hungry! Very unimpresseed!~bacon ~1
AXxoWmwi9mlqFASkzOnwug~2Ra1dbtomhBhooHmsWpiRQ~I literally booked this place the night before, and having checked reviews out online, I lowered my expectations a lot. But this was the only place left in Toronto...YOLO?  The staff was cheerful and a pleasure to work with. I got in late (8:45ish) and had warned them ahead of time and it was just fine. The room was a bit small but had HUGE in-room lockers. I've stayed in a bunch of hostels before and this was the first one with lockers so big I could fit my daypack, my check-in size travel backpack and some souvenirs. Unfortunately the beds creaked a lot so my sleep was less than ideal. The bunk beds also didn't seem particularly stable as I was climbing up either. The showers didn't have a changing area so it was just awkward to change in a wet shower environment. BUT I found everything to be rather clean. No insects or anything, unlike the reviews I had seen at hostelworld.  Pretty basic breakfast. Toast with jam, peanut butter and Nutella and cereal. Coffee and milk available. Full kitchen. Plenty of seats and a flat-screen TV. One of the better hostels I've stayed at in terms of wifi.   Otherwise, everything was pretty tidy. I stayed three days and felt just fine, but apparently the neighborhood can be a little shady. The morning I left, the TV in the lobby had a ticker saying a man was stabbed at a bar near College/Augusta...and I was like, "wait a second, this hostel is at College/Augusta...at least I'm leaving today?!" But if you're careful, it can be fun to hang in the Kensington area! It feels like a hippy/counterculture sort of area.~peanut butter ~4
HQ-JuSquwiI1RrZPCjyUIQ~bk-eRojfjnipD5BCMm4kvg~We practically furnished our entire condo from Statement Furnishings! I had been looking at Wayfair and had seen Find it near you.... That is how I found this gem. If you don't mind picking furniture from catalogs and being patient in your search then you have hit a jackpot !  Brock worked effortlessly to help me find everything I was looking for. I even got some of the same exact items that I saw on Wayfair but at even more of a savings. I was also amazed at the delivery and set up of the items... All at no additional charge. This is unheard of. Wes is an exceptional young man. He is genuinely very polite and really cares about customer service.  Nafe also is wonderful and very hardworking. Also if there is a problem with something they literally bend over backwards to make it right. I am so happy to have found Statement Furnishings. I was able to get everything I wanted at an exceptional savings and to work with such nice people is just the icing on the cake!~cake! ~5
HQ-JuSquwiI1RrZPCjyUIQ~oDaVG_QKeRF2iisOfJnw8w~On May 5th, I went in with my friend to buy a fabric headboard. I asked when it would be delivered by as I wanted it within a week due to out of town guests coming.   The woman (blond) said that it would be at the store by Tuesday May 10th and she would call me in the next couple of days to confirm if it would be delivered to my house the day it arrived (if it got there early in the morning) or by Wednesday.  I called and left 2 messages on Saturday to confirm when it would be delivered. No one returned my call.   I called again on Monday and said I called twice on Saturday about the delivery date and no one returned my call. The woman said that someone else would call me right back to confirm. No one did.   I then physically went into the store yesterday (Wednesday) and said I called 3 times and no one called me back so I came in to see when it would be delivered. The same blond woman said the truck was arriving tomorrow (Thursday) and I could get it maybe Friday or maybe next week.   I said I wanted it by the weekend and she said she would call me today (Thursday) to confirm delivery date.   I waited all day for them to call me. No call  It's been a week and they said they would get it to me in a week.   So I called my credit card company and reversed the charges.  Thank goodness for American Express customer service   Since you don't return calls. Keep the bed.   I scrambled this evening and walked into another furniture store and bought a bed frame. It's being delivered tomorrow. Guaranteed.   It blows my mind how disrespectful it is to not return calls especially when they said they would.   It's too bad as they do have nice pieces.~date date. ~1
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~GM9qjbF0i-cqIlu7tg2vkQ~We chose this place as it was close to the movie theatre and well, what the heck. So glad we did! Very quiet on a Sunday night which could be off putting but we received a warm greeting and so we got comfortable.  The menu seemed just right- standard Thai fare with some nice pictures and clever descriptions-- we were drawn to several dishes. We had the crispy spring rolls and mango salad for starters. Then we shared the pad Thai (very good- my friend who was craving it after years away in Italy declared)- light and well flavoured, not heavy or gummy. Also had a very flavourful red curry chicken. Just coconutty enough and quite spicy!  Cashew chicken and ginger beef (not crispy if that's maybe what you are expecting) rounded out the dishes and a big bowl of rice for the table. We were 3 people and had very few leftovers bc everything was so tasty.  And the service was lovely. Attentive (lots of water refills) but not intrusive.  I saw some take out pickups and I think deliveries going on too.  We will definitely add this to the post-movie list, as I'd rather eat local than at a chain/box restaurant any day!~thai mango salad thai ( chicken. cashew chicken ~4

-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~xKfSPVs-PTES62TrWZVv-w~This restaurant took me a little by surprise. It is unconventional in the way that the waiters do not serve you (you go get the menu and order at the register). The restaurant is also a little more informal and best for lunch dining or a very casual dinner. Despite the different ambiance the food was really, really well done. If you are looking for good Thai food at descent prices you should definitely give this place a chance.~thai ~4
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~s73aYs4C1MEUvUj7Yd-oEw~I must say I am very critical of restaurants and their customer service. This is a great place to order from. The chef that the have now is great. I had a problem once with the food and the owners call me back and wanted to make the situation better by being very generous and b giving my next order on the house. They really didn't need to do this as only one item was the issue. I order from here weekly and give two thumbs up to the young entrepreneurs. The delivery person is very polite and courteous . Mangosteen's management and delivery driver always remember my name and always get my order right. They say delivery will be 40 mins but I have never waited more than 30 mins. FOOD IS ALWAYS hot and fresh  BEST THAI IN THE GTA.   KRISTY~mangosteen thai ~5

-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~xcBxbrxpaCQ9FCYV5p57TQ~Although its on the Queensway, it's location still feels tucked out of the way, which is perhaps why the place is never all that busy. But don't let that make you think the food is no good or the service is terrible. Their signature Pad Thai was amazing, and their Yellow Curry and Mango Chicken Stir-fry were delicious. Our only complaint was with the waiter not writing down our order which resulted in a few trips back to ask what we ordered and still bringing a Cashew Chicken to the table.~thai mango chicken cashew chicken ~4
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~6hFkREmr4VKpo9Jxsp7TxQ~A restaurant I have been meaning to try for a long time and I have finally done so.  I went with relatives for dinner and upon arrival, it was empty. Usually that's not a good thing to walk into (and it was a bit daunting), but it was understandable as the location of restaurant was really obscure.  Besides the lack of diners, although I did noticed there were people coming in to pick up food later on, I enjoyed my time there.   It's a small, nicely designed restaurant. Modern and clean looking. The plating of the meals were great too. The server was also very helpful.  The food was tasty. I found there wasn't anything really special about the Pad Thai though, but that's just me I am and I am in no way a Thai expert, but I loved the pineapple fried rice, Green Curry  and coconut soup (and I generally dislike coconut). As for the portion size, I wouldn't say it was huge but average size for the price.  If you haven't given this restaurant a try, I'd say go for it!~thai thai pineapple fried rice, coconut soup ( coconut) ~4
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~qEV500QStvBQEalLsVmafQ~A little Thai gem conveniently located near the cineplex theatre on the Queensway!  I might not have found this place without a tip from a coworker that lives in the area, and it turns out another coworkers brother owns it! So with those two recommendations, and a date at the Queensway VIP, it was an easy choice.   The place is small, with two booths and a few tables. Based on the number of people coming in for takeout, I imagine that's a popular aspect of the place.   We started with two apps, the fresh rolls and chicken crispy spring rolls. Both were delicious and fortunately the fresh rolls came out super quickly because I was starving! So starving that when the spring rolls came out I forgot to take a picture. Whoops. I then tasted three of the entrees, my own was the beef pad sew which was AWESOME - not light on the beef at all and the cut of meat was a higher quality than I was expecting. Yum! I also tried the curried up pad Thai and Tom yum noodles. Both were excellent!   We were lucky enough to enjoy a banana fritter on the house which was also excellent!   One more about the place is that there's no liquor license, which was sad because I wanted a beer! That's probably due to the takeout nature of the restaurant, and I survived. Lucky they serve alcohol at the movies.   I could definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in the area!~thai date chicken beef beef thai banana ~4
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~mKsqodRc94Mnk9SugX2MKw~I'm generally not one to give any restaurant a low rating if I think their food is potentially delicious.. and now you're asking, how can I say potentially?   Firstly, I will say that as a small business owner myself, service to the customer and making sure the customer leaves your business happy is paramount and unfortunately, neither the food or the business ethic has left a good taste in my mouth.  As Mangosteens is new and very close to my home, I ordered their Famous Pad Thai some Spring Rolls and Mango Sticky Rice through Orderit.ca. As a lover of spicy foods, I added a comment for it to be hot and spicy just out of past experience with every other Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Well ... I am not about to blame Mango for the 35 dollar price tag to get this single order 2 minutes down the road to my house .. BUT .. The next few hours proved to be an heated experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 2 Litres of water didn't even get me through half the Pad Thai. It was fine with my friends to laugh at my attempts to eat this Noodle INFERNO but I had to stop. I don't need to expand on the extreme pains keeping me up from 4 am to 6:30 that night.  The next day I wrote to their website and after no reply I went to their restaurant and simply asked them to give me another Pad Thai without the ridiculous heat. They said they couldn't but they would have the Manager call me. .. They didn't call.   I have just got home after a return trip to Mangos and after a lengthy chat with the Manager that included some drivel about "Racial Profiling" when I mentioned I never had such heat in a dish from other establishments, their reply was that restaurants would tone down the heat for people like myself. LOL .. OK ... So when you deliver to strangers via take out, you turn the heat back up? I asked myself. .. Here was someone willing to give their restaurant another chance to redeem themselves and I'm in a verbal volley over a 12 dollar dish!  My theory after they offered me 50% off, was to waive them of my business and to vent a little here. I'm sure their food might be very good but there is a Thai restaurant across the street. If just one person reads this and agrees that for the sake of future business with a customer is to make them happy rather then bicker about semantics then that is a 12 dollar expense they should have bared.   I won't be going back kids!~thai mango thai mango thai. thai thai ~1
-tcCrvnFDct3WRb-wFG85Q~1Kzx-8A-RCTooF39O_kODQ~Noodle dish is mediocre at best. Not impressed. Pad thai taste like one from thai express with upgraded protein potion. Even tho the service is great, the kitchen just didn't do it. Verdict: Tried once and done.~thai thai ~2
AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig~hJIuw-TNwTq0GhXOY9Mp9g~Great, great place for our Wedding!  The photographer said  he had never seen such a great background perfect for photos. The Artist who sang loved the venue and all accessible audio equipment and available video screens!  The decor all included in $300 venue fee was of the best quality. All we had to do was show up!... Not to mention the food! Out of this world! The spicy soup was superb! Escovish Fish delicious, Jerk kitchen finger licking good, rice and peas and of course fried plantain completed the dish!  My guests loved the food and will definitely be back for more. The service was great as always! All in all a memorable event! They even allowed us to bring our own Wedding cake and served it for us with non-alcoholic champagne... of course! Thank you Lorena and Collins!

AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig~5m6eGXu6ULg1778Rl02jsg~So I decided to go here after seeing that it was a new place that opened up around the area.  Based on the success of most of the west-indie places around the area I thought that it couldn't be bad at all right?  When you go inside, you're not really sure what the deal is.  It's half cafe, half bar.  On one end you have a cafe with cakes and cafe tables; on the other end you have a stage for a band and a pool table.  Weird.  Oh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?  To give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.  The chicken was dry and not really flavourful... I'd almost put it on par with chicken from metro that had been sitting out for a while.  That's about what it tasted like.  Same thing with the rice and peas.  Not exactly the best thing in the world; in fact, far from it.  Being in a plaza with pretty strong contenders, this place isn't going to win anyone over at this rate.  If you want to have some jamaican food, drive 2 minutes down the block and you'll get something way better.~chicken coleslaw peas. chicken chicken peas. ~1
AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig~jasG9nOlGSKMPnPcCOVKJg~I went here at the request of my boyfriend for take-away, he was really in the mood for some good Caribbean food and it sounded like a good idea to me. The place was easy enough to find considering I'd never been there before, and the service was decent.  Not overly friendly, but I was acknowledged. Walking in I noticed how different this place was set up to other restaurants, as they had a little cafe-type area to the left, and a pool table/stage in front/to the right.  The whole place was very bright and clean, and had music playing softly in the background.  I didn't realize until I was leaving that it was gospel music; which in hindsight makes sense considering the restaurant name.  I ordered the large jerk entree, chicken fingers and fries, and the slushie special.  The slushie was a pina colada flavour, about 16oz for $1.00, and it tasted AMAZING.  After finishing it, I wished I had gotten another for myself before leaving the store.  The chicken fingers and fries to be honest, were horrible.  They tasted worse than something I would have ruined at home.  The chicken was the same kind as nuggets from a slimy fast food chain or low-cost frozen nuggets, and the fries were unseasoned.  For $7.99, I was extremely unimpressed.  The jerk entree my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic.  It was a huge portion (4 hefty sized legs) tons of rice and peas, with a spicy coleslaw.  I tried some of his meal, and while the jerk was too spicy for my taste everything was cooked wonderfully.  His $8.99 was hands-down worth the price, and made my meal seem worse by comparison.  He was able to eat his portion for three separate meals (lunch, dinner, lunch the following day).  My meal,  I tried eating what was left for lunch the following day, and I got about 4-bites in before I started feeling extremely sick.  Overall I would definitely go back to this place, but I would steer clear of the "American" dishes, as I feel the love and attention is more placed into the Caribbean-style dishes. Also: if you are sensitive to spicy food, avoid the jerk and go for the fried chicken instead.  I assume it would be just as nicely cooked, only without the spice ;-)~chicken fingers fries, chicken fingers fries chicken fries peas, coleslaw. fried chicken ~4
4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ~jkIiksuCPPHDhJzFjJ3dCg~This restaurant was very nice and I enjoyed the meal. the prices are not too expensive, and the portions were decently sized. the chicken bbq wings and classic burger (which I had) were very nice and the only problem we had with the meal were the undercooked chips. staff were nice and the meal took about 15 minutes to be served. good choice of drinks. recommend it.~chicken classic burger ~4
4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ~S0VI9q9YDidXIBN6VYsnxw~Who would have ever thought to try Mexican food in Scotland? Me, that's who! Very nice place and location with plenty of parking. The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us. Not sure where they derived their version of Mexican food from but whatever, might as well try it. Popcorn as a starter instead of chips and salsa? Um, ok. Never seen that before. I tried the fajitas and they were served and tasted like every other Mexican place I've eaten. Family had the loaded nachos and complained about the soggy chips within. Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as "nachos". Other than that, the pricing was fair and comparable to other places. Not my favorite but I'd probably go back. Our server, Eden, was awesome and had a thick Scottish accent. Very nice and affable but I literally had to ask her to slow down when speaking because of the loud atmosphere in the restaurant. She took my joking about her accent in stride and we had a good laugh about the stupid American who gave her a blank stare when she spoke. I recommend this place, if you can't find better elsewhere.~popcorn chips salsa? fajitas nachos chips salsa tortilla chips ~2
4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ~pxn07Jbo5lr3igFTs3ZybQ~I must admit, I was slightly disappointed in Chiquito. The restaurant is decorated very nicely with lots of little Mexican objects dotted around everywhere but when it came to food, it kind of fell flat.  I had a beef burger with chips and when it came, it occupied a very small portion of the plate and the burger was clearly frozen. The chips were oven chips, obviously. The chips had far too much seasoning on them for my liking and were too herby.  It was a very hot day when we visited and the AC wasn't working, the restaurant was packed and since there is little lighting in the place, it felt quite claustrophobic, as if we were being packed into the place like sardines in a can.  The only good thing about the restaurant was its clean toilet facilities!  The burger was pretty pricey as well. I think it was £11.95! I could have gone next door to Five Guys and gotten the same thing but at a cheaper price and a larger portion. I don't think I will be returning to Chiquito.~beef burger chips burger chips chips, chips burger ~2
4aFAN5aS0Y873KNhBlkAvQ~YFTiW-YgCOajQYuGphA0QQ~As I couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat I ordered two starters - the nachos and the quesadillas.  Priced £3 each, it's not bad what you receive just nothing that wow either.   The nachos were tasty at first but got less appealing at the end and not really my kinda nacho.  the quesadillas were feta & sweet potato and was lacking in seasoning.   I've been to this place many years ago as a kid probably on a birthday night out. And didn't have any quiffs about it, that's cause I was a kid and probably not as clued up on food as I know. (I call myself a food snob, generally cause it's true).  BUT I give the chains a try and in the case I may not come back as it's just wasn't my cup 'o tea, But with certain friends I may have to compromise on coming back as they are not food snobs!  Staff were on the go and really helpful, so not fault there.~nachos quesadillas. nachos quesadillas sweet potato ~3

7K_yGsP6CVy1-hUpQvnQRg~vkMwEEVMttMN-dKU5Cpsww~There are two Fit For Life locations in this area, one in the Atrium, and this one, which is actually in Dundas Station on the southbound side. It's kind of tucked away, so it'd be easy to walk right by and not notice it at all, but its worth stopping for a bite to eat if you want something "healthy". Beware: this is not the place to go if you're in a rush, unless you pick up one of the ready to go meals that are in the fridge. They tend to take their time making things (all wraps and sandwiches go in the panini press, which adds to the wait time) but they make it fresh in front of you. It's a trade off I suppose!  While not everything on their menu classifies as "healthy" (an 800 calorie wrap for one meal doesn't really work for me) I've gone to both locations numerous times, for breakfast and lunch and have had generally pleasant experiences every time.   If you want a quick cheap breakfast they  have a number of "toonie" options in the morning, including a grilled cheese. But beware - I got one of these so called $2 breakfasts and by the time I was done, it cost me $5 - but that's because I added bacon and tomato and they never told me how much extra it was (given, I could barely understand the girl but that's my own fault for not clarifying). If you want to pay a toonie, stick with the basics. I'll add that I don't eat a lot for breakfast usually and not eating breakfast at home is rare, so the small grilled cheese sandwich (plain the second time) was enough to get me through the morning til lunch but my male coworker, who values quantity, complained about how small it was. The full blown grilled cheese with bacon and tomato WAS a great option for the "feeling iffy morning-after-a-night-of-drinking ".  The veggie wrap is rather nice - for something without meat in it, its a filling but light-feeling meal. Also, not too much sauce or stuffing, just the right amount. The Turkey Bacon club is yummy but its also rather large. I have a hard time finishing the entire sandwich and usually someone at work finishes the other half for me.  For a place that claims to be healthy, they've only recently added nutritional information to their website and I was a bit put off by some of the values they had for my favourite meals. However, that being said,  you can eat at Fit For Life without having that guilty "I just ate McDonalds" feeling and feel full and satisfied at the same time.~wraps sandwiches cheese. bacon tomato cheese sandwich ~3

7K_yGsP6CVy1-hUpQvnQRg~JiwbkCBNXcWT-HhH8WHRew~Excellent stuff!  We logged into just-eat today and it was the first hit as it's new.  I gave it a peek and was happy to see the words BURRITOS.  =)  We got a tex-mex steak burrito, a veggie burrito, some sweet potato bites (with an amazing sauce), and we actually got 2 extra burritoes because we weren't how sure how big they'd be.  They are HUGE.  I can't really describe the size without it falling into weird places, but they are about six inches long, 2 inches around, and FULLY packed.  I can't believe how little they charge, because these are good.  The steak is really lean and tasty (I tried a bite), and the veggie ones are basically solid packed with totally fresh food - and I would guess that not even 1/3 of the filling is rice.  WOW!  Lots of corn.  We are definitely saving these for tomorrow's dinner, because we can't even THINK of eating anything let alone another whole burrito.  The only thing I would ask/beg for is vats of guacamole.  Pleaaaase?~burritos. steak burrito, burrito, sweet potato ~5

Each burrito is about 600grams.  So if you eat 2 of them it's like 2.6lbs or so. One burrito might fill a regular person I guess. I don't know...maybe i'm just hippo. Taste wise is good! I wouldnt pay regular price for it though.  I'd probably feel ripped off, if i did.  Get the specials. Is it really healthy for you though? who knows. The website is under construction still. Tasted good though.. that's all I care.~chicken burritos ~4
9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg~oNlbIEZp1VU7oRNPTuE2Zw~This is a technocrat's pizza parlor.   If you order online, you are taken to a website called foodler.com. You place your order just like you would order a book on amazon.com, and you get a total and everything. They even calculate a tip for you (15 or 20 percent) that you can put on the card, send you an email confirmation, and even estimate a delivery time.  The food came ten minutes early. Pretty nice.   Was it good?   Oh my my, oh hell yes, got to put on your party dress! Or um...pants if you're um...not that there's anything wrong with, I mean, Roddy Piper wore a kilt...  While they've embraced the future in terms of placing orders, they get medieval when it comes to food prep.  Stone oven folks. That's what they say anyway, and I'm inclined to believe 'em since this was crispy and chewy where it needed to be with a strong mozzarella blend, a nicely sweet 'n somewhat chunky sauce, and those uncanned mushrooms that get burnt when the pie comes out.   The Aprimo Steak has it all and as a result is magnificently sloppy. If you ate it standing up you'd be doing the Philly Stoop, and you wouldn't care who was staring since what you're eating would be too good to allow for an awareness of your surroundings.   "Mozzarella & provolone, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, hot peppers, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes & Italian dressing," they sez.   What is it with mayo on steak hoagies these days around Pittsburgh, and why didn't people start doing this ten years ago? It's not the greatest steak hoagie ever, but it doesn't back down at all from any challenger.  The Italian Hoagie was rather good too. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't baked so much that it gets rock-like. It was toasted just enough to maintain pliancy and didn't skimp on the meat at all.   How many years has it been since we got delivery from anywhere in Mt. Oliver? Jeez. They have something to boast of now.~pizza mozzarella mushrooms pie steak mozzarella & mushrooms, hot peppers, lettuce, italian dressing, steak steak sandwiches ~4
9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg~yaM7MtyF3ZEPGgc1ed561A~Yuck, yuck, yuck.  This pizza is not palatable.   We only ordered from there because of their aggressive coupon doorhanging campaign, and being recent transplants from Chicago, knew no better.  We sorely regretted the decision.   Anything would have been better than the pizza we received.  It's hard to screw up pizza, so the one star is awarded for accomplishing just that.   The pizza was laden with unevenly melted blobs of the worst mozzarella I've ever tasted, the sauce was bland, the crust lackluster, the toppings depressing.  No one should have to suffer this pizza.  I would advise them to shut down and stop desecrating the pizza world with this slop.~pizza pizza pizza pizza mozzarella pizza pizza ~1

9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg~QGnrnuGdBPm15Kbp6RgVdQ~This place is alright. There are much better places in Carrick/Mt. Oliver area that have better pies, though. The price is average. They do tack on a $2.00 delivery fee which many other places do not charge. The selection is pretty standard for the area. Most of the pizza joints in 15210 are pretty much the same. This place is a step or two below the rest, unfortunately.  We got a medium pepperoni pizza and a small capiccola hoagie. The hoagie was great. Crispy, crunchy bread. A good hefty portion of spiced ham. I asked for banana peppers and they were quite liberal with those. The hoagie was quite nice...and again pretty standard for the area.  The pizza wasn't too great. The crust was nice and crispy, big plus. There was alot of cheese on it....salty, oil and nutty. The only complaint was the sauce...which tasted like canned tomato sauce...no spices or nothing. It was tart and very basic...very bland. Normally I don't fret so much over the sauce as long as the crust is spot on...but they slathered on way too much sauce and it kinda just killed the pizza for me.  The price for a medium 1 topping pizza and a half hoagie plus delivery fee was $18.01...like I said quite pricy for the area. They had a bunch of coupons for specials where we have gotten like twice as much food for just a couple bucks more....but we didn't need a whole hoagie and a large pizza...it woulda been a waste.  All in all...this place is just a little below average. We had the pizza before and we remembered it not being all that great. This second time confirmed this. The hoagies are good though, but plenty of other places in the area have hoagies just as good. The $2.00 delivery fee is a real downer, though.~pizza pepperoni pizza ~2
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~S7vKGrhHeSSmcg10Wwsgeg~Tasty, inexpensive, and out-of-the-ordinary,  Mezzetta is a neighbourhood institution.  The food ranges from lucious to tasty, the prices are great, the service is always good, and you can satisfy vegetarians, meat-eaters, and people on weird diets at the same restaurant.        There are deals on Monday and Tuesday nights, but unless you're feeling broke, go the rest of the week when the best chef is working.    My favourites: slow shrimp, dream sausage (aptly named), Persian rice, Oriental green beans, and the best moist, cardamom-scented baklava I've ever had.~shrimp, sausage ( green beans, ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~0YoLbMk3uI813zGsfaauFw~If you are the kind of person who loves food variety (test: when was the last time you stuck your fork into another person's plate because you didn't want to miss out?) you are going to love Mezzetta.    The menu is made up of dozens of little dishes that are cheap enough to order by the handful.  When I was there with family, my father-in-law said, "I've always wanted to order one of everything on a menu.  I can do that here!"  He was pretty excited.  While I would say that little on the Mezzetta menu stands out as extraordinary, it's all very good and the experience is what makes it great.  Dishes of note:  Anything with eggplant is excellent, veggie vine leaves are lemony and good - although a bit mushy, sultan's stew is terrific, roasted peppers and the green beans are divine, falafels are crispy and flavourful.  I haven't tried any of the meat dishes, but they look good on other people's tables.  Fried yams are lacking in crispness and the houmous is lacking in lemon (go for the baba gannoush instead!) but for only a few dollars a dish, you can afford to experiment.  Service is excellent.  True story: my brother-in-law and his girlfriend were there the other day and, it being Passover, couldn't eat the pita bread.  Without a word, the server whisked away the bread and replaced it with whole wheat matzah.  So kind!  Vegetarian score: 9/10.  Tons and tons of choices, you can eat your heart out and not even notice that meat items on the menu.~green beans yams lemon ( pita wheat ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~DXPS-tA5MRRvHLtn6R0uYg~I visit this restaurant at least once a year since I moved here in 2007 and it remains my very favourite in Toronto.  You read that right.  If I had to choose one top restaurant, it would be Mezzetta.  I love the concept.  There are some 50 items on the menu and something for everyone.  It is a lot of fun, especially with a small group, to talk and negotiate what you'll order.  The small plates allow you to get many tastes all in one night.  It is the ultimate restaurant for anyone with commitment issues!  The food itself is delicious.  I don't think I have tried one of the dishes that wasn't pretty tasty--and many are really good, even the basics such as the rice.  The service has always been good too; I have never had a problem with slow service or the like.  The value is fair--if you want to stuff yourself silly and spend as little as possible, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for an interesting dining experience where you won't leave hungry or with an empty wallet, this IS your place.  The place can get a little bit crowded depending on the night and time.  I would recommend a reservation.  I have not been here for the music night.  I think it used to be jazz.  They can accommodate a larger party but the ideal size is probably 4 which allows you to sample 20 of the items.  A bigger party means more items but remember that the size of the plates stay the same--hence, people might not get to try everything.  I think one of the best times to come here is "first date" night, meaning the first proper date after you've met somebody for coffee or a drink.  Talking about the menu items can break any remaining ice and sharing the plates helps build a bond.  Plus you can then go for a walk along St. Clair.    Most highly recommended!~date" date coffee ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~So8LpmXiaJhzbre2GTTXug~My favourite aspect of this place is the atmosphere. Its so warm and inviting, nice for a (first) date if you like your dates casual. The service was excellent. When my partner and I told the waitress to take away one of the plates that we didn't like, she let us pick another, and was generally really sweet. The food was a solid "good, not great."  Some plates were definitely more memorable than others. I enjoyed the lamb shish and kofta (five stars on both of those), but the dips were less memorable. The dish that we didn't like was the eggplant garlic dip (we eat everything, I love eggplant and garlic, and was a bit surprised to not enjoy this), mostly because of the strength of the vinegar and the combo of mint and dill - not my thing Overall, I would probably go back on loonie Mondays or toonie Tuesdays.~date lamb garlic garlic, ~3
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~KXyOc5loY_74gbf7aSOYkg~3.5**  Great dishes, good portions too, but expect be smacked with a good helping of garlic and dill.   4 of us ventured in and ordered away, who could really go wrong with $1.50/every other dish? They brought the dishes in a bit of a strange order with some meat dishes coming before the salads, and then 15 mins would pass and another salad would come.... This caused us to loose track a bit of what we ordered, and how much was on the way. Needless to say we got too much and were pretty stuffed, yet walked away with a small meals worth of leftovers.  We somehow spent $94 with tax and tip altogether, which was a bit of a surprise but I guess even with the discount it adds up...especially when you loose track.   I walked out feeling like I could chase away any vampire within a 5-mile radius. Also my stomach felt dense and a bit oily from the heavy use of olive oils in a lot of their dishes. I would return on a Tuesday and stick to more of the meat skewers now that I have an idea of the selection!~garlic salads, salad olive ~3
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~rmywKiCsqt1_jX0K3vr49A~I sure enjoyed this small, hidden gem. Although I know I may be bit biased because of who I went here with, so I will try to be at least somewhat not biased. But I make no promises!   Who I am kidding? This restaurant is great. In fact, I have been recommending this Mediterranean and Tapas restaurant to close friends for years. It is cozy, on the medium/small size which actually adds to the vibe of homeyness, without ever being tacky.   Of course, the highlight is the food: Generally light, tasty, varied, healthy, well priced and although I have never gone on their Loonie and Toonie days, it really seems like I should drop by and check them out!  Personally, I am a huge fan of tapas but generally find most restaurants in Toronto warp the recipe by giving you overpriced or undersized offerings in the $7 range, and although tapas may be small in size, they are supposed to be inexpensive since half the fun comes out of tasting a varied selection. In Spain, tapas can be as inexpensive as .99 cents of a Euro and in a lot of bodegas give you selected number of them for free. I do not expect that here but at the very least, I would prefer they stick to the spirit of the dish(!) and Mezzeta does that.    Also, FYI, they now have music night, sure there is a $8 covers but really, I can't see how adding live music to your dinner experience could go wrong.   A great place for a date and also to visit with friends, it is a very amiable and malleable location which easy suits different occasions.    One of my personal favourites, specially during the Summer.  Check it out, have fund with their menu! Just do not tell too many of your friends... Let's keep the place to ourselves. ;-)~date ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~oDvmQHjLkpg8TDUVAGOD6Q~The great thing about this place is, you can eat as much or as little as you want. The house recommends 10 dishes for two people, for $30 - or less on Loonie Mondays or Toonie Tuesdays. That generally turns out to be just the right amount for the missus and me, but if you're less hungry, you can order as few dishes as you like at $3.25 a pop.  Favourites from last night's visit: kebab fingers (more, please!), potato moussaka, beef sambousak, fried yams. Wouldn't order again: Eggplant Garlic (with, I think, whey powder, which gives it an unpleasant stale-tobacco flavour). Wish we'd ordered but didn't: Sultan's Stew.  Mezzetta is a great neighbourhood resto that's good enough to be a destination, especially on Wednesdays for jazz, and Loonie Mondays and Toonie Tuesdays, as others have pointed out. I am looking forward to our next summer weeknight visit.~potato beef yams. garlic ( ~4

These are the dishes I able to have a taste of:  Sharing:  *Tahina - A rich purée of sesame seeds, parsley and garlic - nice and refrefreshing but flavours overpowered by all the other tapas we ordered!   *Houmous - puree of chick peas with tahina and lemon, and a secret blend of spices - A OK with the pita bread  *Eggplant Garlic A bold puree of flame-roasted eggplant, garlic, dill, mint, and vinegar  *Fried Yams - Crispy deep-fried yam chips, dressed with fried onion shavings - Yam! Yum! Giulana witnessed me ate the whole order by myself!  *Potatoe Sambousak -  Potato and onion puree wrapped in puff pastry, three pieces dressed with mezziki - brownish looking.. too bad those are not mini chocolate cakes.. dry and uninspiring!  *Exotic Green Beans - Crisp-fried green beans, shaved onion, dill and garlic, dressed spicy hot - not spicy hot at all! But the beans were cooked well, crunchy and fresh! My fave of the night!  *Mushrooms - Tender sautéed button mushrooms served in a garlic vinaigrette - standard, ok but not too exciting!  Not Sharing: (But I made them share with me)  *Kofta - spiced minced beef balls served in a rich tomatoe sauce - Not bad, but not really outstanding..   *Dream Sausage -  Flame-grilled beef-lamb sausage, spiced with herbed hot sauce (Stole from Tony F) MEH.. too lamby!  *Fish Shish -  Tasty, marinated marlin or swordfish, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Giulana B) - GREAT! light and refreshing with a hint of lemon  *Lamb Shish - Savoury chunks of marinated lamb leg, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Tony F) - Surprised that I like it! Rich flavour without lamby taste   *Vine Leaves -  Herbed minced beef and spiced Basmati rice wrapped in vine leaves and dressed with garlic yogourt and dill (Stole from Giulana) - hey I have no idea I should eat the leaves.. Chinese don't eat the leaves we used that as a wrapping!  *Chicken Shish -  Delicate, juicy marinated chicken breast, flame-grilled - A-OK, but not really memorable!  I have a really enjoyable meal... the bills come out to be $15 per person with taxes and tips. I think I don't mind going on a Toonie Tuesday as a value oriented person that will be the way to go!!  *Special thanks for Tony F and Giulana for letting me try their food..

4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~EVlpz-4Ug_W-PFz66vn3Zg~A great budget Mediterranean tapas place that would be one of the best in town for the price, except the fact they microwave a number of the dishes and even the pita bread!? You can ask them to not microwave some dishes, but we were told others are premade and frozen.    Go on Monday or Tuesday for the best deals and dishes around 2 dollars.  On those nights, 2  really big people can get seriously full on about 30 dollars including tax and tip.~pita ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~2r85jxaQdyqFx9B9xAbtgg~My official rating: 4.5 stars Toonie Tuesday upgrade: 5 stars If I was Wayne C. rating: 3.5 stars  As previously mentioned, this place is indeed a "little gem".   We visited tonight for the Toonie Tuesday special - each dish costs $2.42 on Tuesdays. Bill only came to $30 for 2 people, we had 10 tapas-sized dishes and a juice.   I especially enjoyed the hummus, dream sausage, Sultan's stew, crispy green beans and the eggplant dip.   We also had the beef skewers, swordfish, a salmon dish, a rice dish, and potato moussaka. All good. Rice and potato moussaka were a bit bland. Will probably give those a pass next time, because there are 30 other menu items I want to try!  Also worth noting - the service was absolutely great. We had a very friendly server, she knew the menu well, was quick and efficient.   We arrived early, around 6pm, which seemed to be a perfect time to avoid the rush. Many of the tables were reserved.  Going back to this one for sure! Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!~sausage, green beans beef salmon potato potato ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~92zXjOt-puX9R7KUe8wbNA~When I heard the idea of visiting a Mediterranean tapas place I engaged the adventure with a yeahh!! I really liked the concept of picking 10 different tapas for 36 something bucks and share.  When we arrived to the entrance, I didn't have a good feeling but they were smart enough to display newspaper notes of approval (from 2009) in the windows, so we went in.  We ordered hummus, eggplant, potato kind of empanadas, Phylos dough stuffed with spinach, shrimp, shoulder veal and lamb kebabs, salmon, some kind of red sauce we couldn't say what it was, and something else that if I can't even remember for sure wasn't worth at all.  The service lacked at lot. She didn't gave us a glass of water even when we ordered beer and wine... When the dishes came, a guy and the waitress would just smack the dishes in the glass table without explaining what was what.  But what killed every aspiration of a decent meal was the sound of the pip pip on a microwave... Like seriously they cooked it last night (hopefully) and warmed it for us with love in that thing we didn't even use for popcorn... Try to pretend your meat came from the grill and put the microwave on silence. And yes, after 2 min some dry, chewy meats kebabs were on the table... We ate them for respect to the animals.  The best part of the meal as they recognize was the hummus and the eggplant stew, or I can't tell because they wouldn't have the consideration of telling what dish was what.~potato spinach, shrimp, lamb salmon, popcorn... ~1
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~fNy1dpVZbl1pDkAc2SZKuQ~I love the ability to sample all the different dishes in small portions. You feel like you get a lot, but because they are all small plates, you end up feeling full on less.  Service was excellent. Woudl highly recommend the sausage, and encourage you to try the lamb kebab.~sausage, lamb ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~BA8eaTbjaHBfkso-j4Lb0g~This place is a gem and I was lucky to find it as St. Clair & Christie is not my usual food scene.  A friend who used to live in the hood invited me and after a quick browse at the menu I obliged.  (http://www.mezzettarestaurant.com/food_menu.html)  Mezzeta is tiny, with seating for no more than 20-25 at a time.  This can make for a cozy meal if you get in, yet frustrating if you're left out in the cold and are starving!  I highly recommend visiting on a Loonie Monday or a Toonie Tuesday.  Although the place is completely packed, service is speedy.  Your servers will maintain a consistent parade of mezze dishes.    As a self-professed meat lover, I honestly enjoyed the veg dishes most.  Sultan's Stew is a must and Fantastic Falafel speaks for itself!  Skip the salads.  Leave room for everything else!  Make sure to grab a jug of lemonade.  It's made with orange blossom water, which makes it extra fragrant and delicious.  Super cheap too, at $5.  If you have room for dessert after the 20-dish tapas, enjoy the apricots and creme.  More of the orange blossom water infuses the dish.  Divine!~salads. ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~NZ2NitzDVpei8j11FeoxCA~I really really enjoyed my experience here. A true tapas style menu where the tapas are really reasonable priced and decently sized. Definitely go with friends so you can try a bunch of the dishes. They have quite a big selection enough to keep the meat eaters and veg people happy. The star for me was surprisingly a spicy mint carrot dish. I was not expecting that! The interior is a bit odd with a lot of exposed wood columns. It reminded me of a beach house or something similar.~carrot ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~fxomVdjne6eQDQQfYQw2RA~I had THE worst meal of my entire adult life at this restaurant. I am baffled that there are any positive reviews.    My boyfriend and i ordered several dishes on Sunday to take home.    None of them were edible, and I am pretty sure they were old and had been reheated in the microwave.   The vine leaves were dry and tasted rotten. The lamb was dry and tasteless. The pita was stale!!!  The kofta came in a sauce that tasted like jarred tomato sauce. The babaganouj was the only dish that was not spoilt.   We couldn't eat any of it, and I cannot believe this place is in business.~lamb pita tomato ~1
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~TBkE2JxjDMeKPVfQD_0iqA~First time here, it's an interesting idea and not bad, but was a little disappointed.   I like that they recommend how many dishes you should get for 2, 3, 4, etc people. It's also great that you can try a large number of different dishes for a very reasonable price.   The pita they provide for your table are just not very good. So many of the dishes you can get are very 'dip-in-able'... If the pitas were top shelf it would greatly raise the level of enjoyment on these dishes.   Service was pretty speedy and, as I mentioned, the prices are fair.   All in all not a bad place~pita ~3
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~711nx97_JoWEISw1ipV1qg~It took moving out of the neighbourhood after 3 years before I visited, despite friends' endorsements for the restaurant for years. My boyfriend does Meatless Monday and we had an errand to do nearby, so I suggested Mezzetta based on those endorsements & my long-time intention to visit. When we arrived we discovered that on Monday every 2nd dish up to 15 items costs $1.42 (every Tuesday Every "mezze" dish is $2.42, limit of 25 per party). The regular price of each food item on the menu is $3.50. Way to do Meatless Monday!  We ordered about a dozen dishes. The quality was amazing. We enjoyed all of it. Some standouts: I forgot how good falafel could be and then I had theirs. It was some of the best falafel I've had in Toronto, and among the best I've had outside Israel.  Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, spiced just right. The smokiness of the baba gannoush was exactly what I like in that dip. The Sultan's Stew, an "exotic stew of sautéed and spiced eggplant, zuccini, tomato, green and red bell peppers, and onion", made my mouth happy. The Red Goat salad ("goat" being the feta cheese) tasted really fresh.  My least favourite was one of the 2 meat dishes that we ordered (he bent on "Meatless Monday"): The moussaka.   Service: Friendly and fast. Value: Fantastic (though remember, we went on Monday when the most expensive thing we ordered was a pitcher of lemonade).  My boyfriend wants to make it our regular Monday evening destination. I can't argue with that. While I might order some meat items - some chicken or lamb shish, perhaps -  I'm happy to stick with the many vegetable offerings.  The awards and accolades bestowed upon Mezzetta by local media such as Toronto Life, Post City and Now are well deserved.~tomato, bell onion" salad ( cheese) chicken lamb ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~9tfbVykQPod2UP7vljkw5Q~Great little place with delicious food and a good value for food and drinks.   We had the dinner for 2 (10 small plates) and it was so much food that we couldn't finish it!   Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the meal format was different and exciting. The chefs clearly take pride in their food and pay attention to details.   The highlights for us were the lamb and shrimp kebabs, the grilled meat on both was very tender and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  The meatballs were also tasty. The baba ghanouj, it had an interesting smoky taste. We also had green beans, hummus and sultans stew which were all delicious.  The mixed greens salad was even surprisingly good with a tasty vinaigrette and chopped walnuts on top.     Four stars instead of five due to the service, which was friendly, but the 2 servers seemed inexperienced and a bit overwhelmed by the full restaurant!   Overall a delicious & enjoyable meal, we'll definitely be back.~lamb shrimp meatballs green beans, greens salad ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~Uluts7fVzzy3rYdBdQKNSQ~I heard good things about this restaurant and gave it a try.  They call themselves a middle eastern restaurant. I cook and bake many middle eastern foods. I even have traveled to many middle eastern countries and the food at Mezzetta was worse than terrible.  They seem to forget that cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, and other spices are used for middle eastern cooking. The flash green beans, which I thought was a Chinese dish was horrible. This is favorite food of our waitress.  The falafel was sticky and raw, the baba ganoush flavorless, the pita bread was served cold, the hummus was too thick and flavorless, the hot sauce was disgusting,  mistake, the stuffed phyllo with a sauce of some sort was not pyllo dough and tasteless, the Mediterranean salad was bland. Although the water was very good.    The lone waitress was condescending and not very helpful.  There are a lot of  middle eastern restaurants in the GTA and by far this is a disaster. If anyone out there knows middle eastern food stay away and if you don't stay away.~garlic, green beans, pita salad ~1
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~u8yXwwP_zRd3ZZegw-ixPw~The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.  This was a solid 3.5 Star experience  5 star -nothing 4 Star -Price on Monday and Tuesday Ambiance on Wednesday- They have jazz humus hot sauce with bread vegetable stew Serving size 3 Star -Price on other days -attitude and service -Taste, cleanliness  2 star Moroccan Cigars Price 1star Sausages  We went to Mezzeta on Tuesday and will probably only go back on the special days. On Tuesdays you get all tapas for $2.50 and on Monday $1.50~sausages ~3
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~eJoW9RyOV_Yr4BoGxk329A~I came here on a date. A surprise my date had planned. I was skeptical due to (a) the surprise factor and (b) the type of cuisine when he started throwing hints.  It was most amusing when we arrived at 7pm (reservation) and it was empty; there was no need to make a reservation!  The service was very efficient. No complaints.  The food. I threw out my skepticism. I was expecting shwarmas but I was delightfully surprised to read the menu and discover so many tasty tapas. This is, in effect, a tapas bar.  We ordered the plate for 2, which comes with 10 tapas dishes. We had the lamb, veal and shrimp skewers, a feta and tomato and red onion salad, the hummus, and several veggie tapas, including mushrooms, green beans and carrots, and the persian rice. We had the Cameron's beer. Good choice.  This is a great restaurant to go to on a 1st date. You share food, or work together to select the dishes (as my date put it, LOL), and have a very pleasant conversation in a casual environment. To be fair, this guy chose wisely!~date. date lamb, shrimp tomato onion salad, mushrooms, green beans date. date ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~7CEFu3i16qqcd-79SQT4Ug~This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Toronto.   I love the cozy private atmosphere in this restaurant. The service is speedy, and the servers are always friendly and treat us with respect.   They offer a wide range of delicious Mediterranean dishes, and I have never had a dish I disliked. And for desert, I love to top of a wonderful dinner with passion fruit in cream.~passion fruit ~5
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~0KrQXB4sdY2XNryyn6NIkg~My husband and I decided to try this place for our wedding anniversary. It was very authentic feeling and we love the concept of choosing 10 different tapas for $36 (2 people). Price was very reasonable as well.  Not all dishes were good and the naan we received in the beginning of the order were what it looked and tasted to be like store bought. They weren't fresh and most likely heated in the microwave.  The Cheese and Spinach Boureka were quite bland and very dry. The kofta with the tomato sauce didn't taste fresh and sauce tasted like it came from a can. The hummus was not the best we've had and needed much more salt. Although the Mediterranean garden salad was  fresh and flavourful. The remaining meat dishes were were quite good as well. Overall it was a great experience trying different types of foods in mini dishes. We would recommend giving this place a try!~cheese spinach tomato garden salad ~4
4BZwZrm3atfkDkc0gV3sCQ~Y_8D3EJ6buCCsZCxyM4J0g~Mezetta is lovely. The interior is a little worn down and offbeat, but the food is nice, well-priced, filling and also, great for vegetarians and vegans, while also accommodating meat-lovers. If you order 5 items each (they're sharing-dishes) you will have more than enough to eat, and lots of different tastes to keep you interested.  I especially recommend the green beans, carrots, and shrimp skewers. Wonderful!~green beans, shrimp ~4
5z5on8hPpFy16-thxyWUgQ~Il6lR80gT_6s6VYmmRlMdg~Hear me when I say: I am not a Steak Bridie girl.   But, just the other day, come lunch time, I found myself with said steak bridie. It was not all too greasy; a large portion with delicious pastry and wonderfully seasoned filling. - It made for a wonderfully satisfying, if a little naughty, lunch. Followed up by the most perfect of scones; not too sweet, very light and with a lovely crisp on the outside.   EB is a traditional, no-frills bakery with an incredibly open kitchen and a small-town family run feel. I once popped in one early morning as they're a key holder for a nearby shop I was covering and left more than a little hyped up for the day ahead, having seen the bakery team at work. All the staff seem really proud of what they do and the service is roaringly friendly.   The Edinburgh Bakehouse sign proudly states 'Everything baked from scratch. - This really does show in their goods.~steak steak ~5
5z5on8hPpFy16-thxyWUgQ~CaQgEJNl4eKnzKtHLyhnLA~We had the good fortune of discovering the bakehouse on a recent visit to Edinburgh.  The scones were amazing and the owners were very friendly.  I had the fruit scone with butter and raspberry jam; the baker applied the jam using a pastry bag.  We then went to a coffee shop and ordered a second "to go" round and returned to the bakery for a reprise.  It was a really nice experience!~butter coffee ~5
5z5on8hPpFy16-thxyWUgQ~m8IWdzYqX_hgW3v-UODfZQ~I was here on 12/12/11.  The staff expressed great curiosity about my American accent, which was funny because I don't think I've ever been to any business in Edinburgh where staff asked where I'm from.  On repeat visits, I see that the service definitely has the "personal touch" so rarely seen elsewhere in Edinburgh.  I can't comment on the meat items, as I'm vegetarian, but I've tried all the other stuff and it was grand.  I brought one of the Scottish-recipe pastries to a Scottish friend, and he was delighted.  They're strictly take-away, but you could always take your pastry, turn left on the corner at Salisbury, and munch away with the view of Arthur's Seat.  As far as the parking goes, I'd advise Salisbury, but in general it doesn't look too terrible.~pastries ~5
5z5on8hPpFy16-thxyWUgQ~uT13IlDB7415Rm-VJD6IAA~Edinburgh Bakehouse is a gem that just opened around the corner from our home.  I've been watching the workers get the space ready, the sign for the opening went up several days ago and I've been eagerly awaiting the opening (as I've never met a baked good that I didn't want to take home).  Worth the wait!  I stopped in on the way home from school drop-off and bought a few goodies (cream & apple turnover, fruit bar, and swiss roll) and a round white loaf.  All for the whopping price of 2.75. Nice generous portions. Wow!  They also offer an assortment of lovely traditional pies.  I'm quite keen to have a go at one of those, maybe this evening as hubby has a work do and I'm always lazy about what to feed the kids when he's not home for supper.  I wish great success to the owner, James, as well as his uncle John, who was filling pastries and working the counter when I walked in.  (Their names are easy to remember ---the bickering brother disciples of Jesus).~apple swiss white pastries ~5
5z5on8hPpFy16-thxyWUgQ~awqExDzDB1QJfH0RJTjTSw~Had the fortune of visiting just as a batch of freshly baked Scottish pies came out. Wandered over to the Meadows to eat (this place is only take away). It was so delicious hot, though I had trouble eating the pie since the top layer came away entirely (not sure if this is because I am a messy eater, or because the pie was underdone? Either way it didn't bother me.)   In addition to the pie I also picked up a buttery and a rocky road. The buttery was chewy and savory, with a crunchy outside, and ultimately satisfying. I had no idea a simple roll could taste so good. The rocky road was a slab of chocolate with some kind of gooey paste inside, dusted with powdered sugar. All three pastries came out to a measly £2.05. Amazing.  The ladies were kind enough to wait while I struggled with my coins, and made the suggestions of the pie and the buttery, which I liked better than my own choice. Great small bakery!~pie pie pie pastries pie ~5
Aev0VbDs6LvcQiq_K8EIKw~3CNTIIZt-U8iWNENGLIXdg~Wow do these suck...  Cold brush them in butter after they are cooked to adhere the toppings and 4 bucks--- I never really valued auntie Anne's until trying these suck pucks. Cold soggy undercooked just how a pretzel should br~butter ~1
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~SX4PL8uLAqlP9fLBOqJC5g~Friendly and cheaper than places like Libretto, but the pizza doesn't hold a candle to the thin crust Neapolitan pizza at Libretto. Maybe that's comparing apples to oranges - definitely a notch above grabbing a slice at Pizza Pizza but it doesn't even compare favourably to Amato.~pizza neapolitan pizza ~2
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~ST-wbjTx6tbHzqYtINLcWg~The pizza competition has a new challenger on Queen. Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.  On my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.  I ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).  But *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.  So, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1  The crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.  Overall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.~pizza pizza pizza pizza mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, onion, pizza pie. ~4
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~ri3m_9l0SsoNCH6EYzhThA~Friends told me about this upscale alternative to the standard pizza joint and something that is basically the equivalent of a Big Mac pizza. When I heard of the channelling of my favorite burger into a pizza, I had to go try it out. First, go hungry. Those thin crust pies may appear to be an easy take down, but they are more filling than you'd think. Secondly, appreciate the service. Out waitress was engaging, fun and remembered my friends from only a couple previous visits. Try the white sauce and mushroom pie or the Big Mac pizza. Top it all off with wine or San Pelegrino. Tasty and different, it's worth the trip~pizza pizza burger pizza white mushroom pie pizza ~4
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~VG_k8LezwfzeCBT6Xp3ZtA~Ordered pizza at work. A little pricey but well worth it. $40 with tip and got a large americano big Mac pizza and it was amazing. Everyone at work loved it so much they ordered a second one after we destroyed the first one.~pizza pizza ~5
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~fYb783KrP2vEKozXXY5O1A~I've been wanting to come here and try the pizza for quite some time.  I was disappointed with the overall taste of my pizza.  Granted I got the pepperoni one (can't remember the exact fancy name).  I asked for light sauce and there was alot of sauce on it.  The pepperoni were little small pieces, it almost reminded me of a hot dog.  I gave this place an extra star because of the service.  Girl working there was nice, very friendly, even came and checked up on us.  Would I come back here?  I don't think so.  I found it to be overall meh, not alot of cheese for what you pay $10 for a personal pizza (they stretch the dough to be thin so it is bigger than what it should be).~pizza pizza pepperoni pepperoni hot dog. cheese pizza ~3
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~pgxjuc-UR-Astc_LhPzLqw~Surprisingly tasteless. It was as if they didn't add salt to anything. The dough had wood fired marks but no wood fired taste. It also just didn't taste. There was no sense of yeast. The mushrooms and pepperoni also were bland. I was very disappointed.~mushrooms pepperoni ~1
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~jeq8aISmUdLiNSwFBoXa4g~I'll have to agree with the other reviewers raving about the service at Enzo Pizzabar. It is unusually warm and pleasant in an area of the city known for aloofness and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude. Pizza was delivered hot and fresh out of the oven with a nice tender crust and zesty tomato sauce along with tasty cheese spread randomly over the pie. Topped off with a hearty tiramisu it made for a satisfying visit and we will be back! (gotta try the Oreo cookie pizza...)~cucumber pizza tomato cheese pie. oreo pizza ~5
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~l7Nf_z8D5NTLJLbiD4XiyQ~I just came in earlier. It was right before close. Had a slice of a veg pizza. It was pretty good. I'll come back for some beef slices later.    The guys working were nice. I'll try a.whole pizza sometime, but I'm.cutting right now. I need to eat more here to further analyze...~pizza beef pizza ~4
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~CQX38k5FSl460CE6TBF35w~This place has stiff competition as there is a good pizza joint right around the corner and then some other spots nearby that serve good pies.  We called in before hand on a Sunday to make sure they are open.  We went for a Margherita and Lana (White Pizza). Also added a bit of the greens on the Margherita. I ordered a glass of Cabernet for good measures.  The pizza took its time but the service is top notch.  On to the main  The Crust is not overly thin nor is it New York Style. The sauce on the Margherita was decent and hits most of the right notes. I would say one of the better pizzas around this area.  A great addition to the pizza scene that's heating up this city. 4 Stars.~pizza white pizza greens pizza pizza ~4
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~PJfEVEqnnpmDY-xZXyo5OQ~Best Pizza in the city hands down!  It was love at first bite when I tried the Americano. Think big mac in pizza form - genius right?!  Other pizza places don't even exist to me anymore.  Another great choice is the Mila - a delicious white pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto.  Other honourable mentions are the Pepe (hot!) and Bonjourno (Think breakfast).    As if a grande Americano wasn't enough - you can also get their dessert pizza which come in nutella or cookies and cream.  Hungry yet?   Delivery service available within a certain area within 40 minutes and they always write a cute note or draw a picture on your delivery box.  Bonus - you can tell them what message you want written on your box.~pizza pizza pizza white pizza mushrooms pizza cookies ~5
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~PKymDz59x3LNXcFf0xGfLQ~I'm a fan of thin crust pizza like Libretto, Brooklyn, etc ... so this isn't my favourite. Service was nice when i went there during the off hours.   I had a slice of mushroom with italian sausange. Fresh ingredients. It was a good quick bite to eat, in and out, pizza by the slice, but again, I'm biased loving my thin crust pizza. Reasonably price for Queen W. Then again, I didn't order a drink so my slice was reasonable.~pizza mushroom pizza pizza ~3
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~zG0jXTo8lOkaLbm700556w~Why the high fiver? The pizza itself is addictive but the main reason is because of the service.  I ordered a personal pizza which they made fresh with ingredients from Italy...yum! While sitting I was offered an espresso, that's class right there. From that I had a great convo with them about the history of their pizza, where they got their ingredients and their future plans.  They are going change the place to a sit down restaurant soon.  I can't wait!!~pizza pizza pizza ~5
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~RFue9Eav1Skr2cXQ5eSM0g~I'm a fan of this newcomer on Queen West. The pizza is dependable and they are creative... if you know the "secret" menu. They do go above and beyond to remember customers and to put names on the boxes, which is a classy touch. I've only had the pizza a couple of times but all my coworkers love the pizza here as well. This is a dependable establishment which is working hard to make a presence and name for themselves in Queen West and Toronto. They got some real heart and are friendly as hell. If you're skeptical, come for the service and try the food. They are earnest and put love into the work and the business and you have to respect that.  Plus I like that they make an effort in an online presence.~pizza pizza pizza ~4
6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ~r4SIliwynpkyiTSYV9zMHQ~Really enjoyed the pizza here, service was great as well.  We had the Enza.  Its a nice snack size pizza, thin crust.  Nice light pizza.  Will come back.~pizza pizza pizza ~4
6c0lS8VP4EXyMefnJgvphg~-EuZckBBaoMKXYaFT6BLfQ~Love it.   I've never gone into the store without being acknowledged by a butcher asking me if I need any help, or how my day is going.   Yes, some things are more expensive than your generic grocery store, but being able to purchase something that isn't full of antibiotics is worth it.   Their pre-marinated chicken wings are the best! Usually around $7/pack, which is around the same price as the PC wings.~chicken ~4
6c0lS8VP4EXyMefnJgvphg~gn4SR3uDmbaAxa-8kPMgaA~There doesn't seem to be any shortage of Butcher Shops within the immediate region along Bloor street and it looks like Rowe Farms Retail Store wants to join in on the action.    It's not a big shop by any means as the entrance area itself has barely any shelf to overwhelm your senses but I did notice a pleasant smell.  The staff was knowledgeable enough to tell me it was one of the staff's lunches and I can't have any. Following my nose doesn't always work it seems.  LOCAL grown, Antibiotic free, Hormone free seems to be the theme here and like that organic trend we all know of, it will give your wallet a bit of a workout.  Plenty of Freezer, Fridge items for sale and I even noticed a Bone-in Ham($50.00+) that has Christmas all over it.  Note: There seems to be a sample island of sandwiches with some olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  The sample lady must have been on break but it seems you won't come in to browse and leave empty handed.   :D~sandwiches olive ~3
6c0lS8VP4EXyMefnJgvphg~FxFCDVHbCMs7x0LMZmu1zw~Although it costs a pretty penny, I go here for all my meats!  The people here are friendly, and I really enjoy the hamburgers and steaks.  I have not partaken in the other fresh food - salads, juices, milk, veggies, mustards, etc., because I typically go to Foods for Life/Max's Market/Cheese Boutique down the street for that stuff!    My only thing I could change - perhaps have a few fattier cuts of meat (however - I might just be a weirdo in my preferences!)~steaks. salads, milk, ~4
6c0lS8VP4EXyMefnJgvphg~Wkn4tnVOIYLTpDVjvaWHuQ~When I saw that Rowe Farms was coming to Bloor West Village, I was elated. The products are expensive, more so than going to your average farmers market, but it is one of the only places in the Village to get antibiotic and hormone free meat, with a nice selection of dairy, eggs, cheeses and local produce. The shop is somewhat minimalist in terms of design, but suits the space very well. The staff have always been friendly and knowledgable.~cheeses ~4
6c0lS8VP4EXyMefnJgvphg~WoihePY_jVA-NcTMIMYsWw~Local? Check. Hormone / Antibiotic free? Check.   Freshness? Well, mostly frozen and/or cryopak, so...  Flavor? Yeah - that's my issue with this place.  After several excruciatingly expensive purchases I feel that the flavor does not justify the means.    This tiny shop could well be the meat and dairy section carved straight out of an urban Whole Foods type place.  It seems to be designed solely to tick all of the boxes of those concerned about from whence their food emanates, rather than what it actually tastes like.    You want FRESH local crud-free chicken? Gasparros is two subway stops west.  Local red and other white meat of the FRESH and FLAVORFUL variety can always be had at Sanagans Meat Locker in Kensington market.  In fact, I cannot come up with one thing here that comes close to my vote as best in the city so....  Sorry Rowe Farms - Nice landing, wrong airport.~chicken? white ~2
3tLuGLcCiGv5qqqhawO3Tg~cuObi07iK6OyWg9T4kBs9Q~We needed a place to get a cold drink, let the two year old kiddo play and work off some energy after a shopping trip, and give Mommy the chance to relax and feed the tiny munchkin.  This place was perfect.  The room with the toddler play area was closed off from the rest of the restaurant so our little Banshee could let off steam without disturbing unsuspecting customers, there was no one else in the playground area so Mommy had lots of privacy for her first nursing in public attempt (under cover of course), we were in air conditioned comfort while it was in the high nineties outside, the area was clean, so it was a win-win situation for all.  Thank you for accommodating us Burger King!~burger ~3
3tLuGLcCiGv5qqqhawO3Tg~w_WQlQUQSg68J41tw-QNCg~Burger King has had its up and downs the past decade but recently I have enjoyed the value menu for a late night meal. Also any where with surge is a okay in my book.~burger ~3
3tLuGLcCiGv5qqqhawO3Tg~eDy-iXKWsfvnLI_Xf1n-Lg~Strictly comparing this to other burger places in the area, is highly rated by me. Considering I order special items and always have it my way they always get it right. I remember the first time they got my order wrong I called them right away and the lady I spoke to apologised instantly and profusely offering to make it right without doing what other places demand, like bring the food back. It's inconvenient and inconceivable to be expected to leave work and return from your break.   As for fish sandwiches everyone else offers a seasonal delight but that's it. Burger king has actually improved their fish sandwich into a long submarine like style that is phenomenal compared to the others.   For those that know my diet they offer a veggie burger and it has mayonnaise so I always order that without, otherwise it's perfect.   Obviously the fries are better than McDonald's.~burger sandwiches burger sandwich burger fries ~4
7p2RbpFkWeFoLKoNPvxvzQ~zsnf6lE66bD5WKt_TTjAxA~Picked up my dry cleaning this morning and I'm still in shock. Had 8 items dry cleaned and the total cake to $64. They charged me $12 to dry clean a $30 sundress from Tilly's! Outrageous and such a rip off! Don't use them!!!!~cake ~1
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~Y6p5D65od9n-KkKlRyKSFQ~Meh.  For some reason, my man thought I would enjoy this place because I'm an American. Not so much.  Is it authentic? Not really. It's super greasy and the food tastes not-so-fresh. The portions are oversized to the point of being made for people with eating disorders. I didn't find much on the menu that was appealing to me. So I would not say it was made for my palette.   The only thing I really liked was the free bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal. The music played throughout was also kind of cute. Like a 50's diner theme. No one else in the place seemed to notice or care.  All in all, overpriced junk food akin to what you'd get at a Denny's restaurant in the states. In UK lingo that would be the lowest denominator of a chain diner restaurant at a very bloated price tag. I know that most restaurants in the UK are priced for tourists, but I still think they should at least deliver quality to the price tag they're advertising. This one does not.  Oh, this place also refused to allow me to take home any leftovers in any form. Also a UK thing that I am aware is *somewhat* uncommon but it's not illegal and I do not see how hard it is to invest in some takeaway cartons for people to take home leftovers. I asked and then the waitress would only offer to let me take my pasta home in a dirty ice cream tub. Um, no thanks.~pasta ice cream ~2
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~084xuEyiD3NenExCEMYm_g~The lunch menu here is good value, but last time I went I left disappointed.    I ordered a margherita pizza. The base was quite crispy but didn't seem very doughy or fresh at all. Also there was hardly any cheese at all, it was shocking!! My boyfriend got the Scottish Breakfast and asked for no egg it came with a runny fried egg on the plate!    Also, the service can be very slow here which added to our disappointment.~pizza cheese egg egg ~2
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~cKd5U0YFuD6YKhD8DadTRw~I hadn't been exposed to Frankie & Benny's prior to our visit at lunchtime, today. I'm glad to add it to the list of places we've visited.  Overall, we said: "Frankie and Benny's was pretty good.  Their soup pleased me, muchly.  Their pasta dish was less good, but their espresso ended things on a better note.  For large group dining, it offers a perfectly pleasant experience, and dishes that are likely to make diners smile.  I think that's what they're aiming for, so should be commended for accurately delivering it"~soup pasta ~3
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~GQPECOa1vQrA3-Sd2-IWzw~For the price, Frankie & Benny's is pretty reasonable. It's one of the many restaurants in the grand Omnicentre, and capitalizes on the fact people will want to eat before/after a movie at Vue cinema!   I'd had two awesome meals at this restaurant, so I'll be a little more generous than my fellow reviewers! If it's still on the menu (as these days annoying change sometimes...) the Californian pizza is fantastic; pesto, mozzarella, and cherry tomatoes, seems to be my favourite sandwich morphed into a delicious pizza. Their waffles, which I've had for dessert, are also delicious!    Aside from mains, they also have a pretty impressive breakfast menu that I'm eager to try!~pizza mozzarella, cherry sandwich pizza ~4
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~mKB4obzyZUTKXYzCIjqyPA~The good thing about the Omni is that you can reference the menus prior to entering the restaurant. We came in for the 2 dishes for under 10.95 pounds, Delicious wing appetizer, sub-par chicken Caesar burger, but my friend had the pepperoni pizza that wasn't bad, but a bit greasy! The service was a bit lethargic!~chicken burger, pepperoni pizza ~3
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~oQM6iidkkVci3JrZ-hH-RQ~bleh.  The food is greasy, it's all vaccum packed and frozen and the staff don't really care if you're there or not.  I ordered a risotto thinking it was a safe option, alas! I was wrong. It was dry, it was sticky, it was just totally wrong.  My brothers had  burgers and said they were alright, but to be honest it wasn't worth the calories. And it's expensive.~risotto burgers ~1
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~WUbbTHvWx5_LfgZDO60XvA~Frankie and Bennys in the Omni is typical of the restaurants you find in the centre. If you're looking for a meal that will cater to all tastes and is cheap and cheerful then this is a good place to start.    The menu is based loosely around an Italian-American theme with the ususal burgers, pizzas, sandwiches etc. Portion sizes are generally on the large side, so you never go away hungry.    Service can be a little on the slow side, but that's normally because it's always very busy. In general i find the waiting staff to be fairly helpful and friendly and if you let them know you're in a hurry, they will try and speed up yout order.    One of the main reasons I go to Frankie and Bennys is there terrifc value lunch menu. For £7.25 you get two courses that are enough to fill you up for the whole day. With starters like potato skins, garlic pizza bread and chicken strips and mains like pizza (full size), burgers and club sandwiches~burgers, sandwiches potato skins, garlic pizza chicken pizza burgers sandwiches ~4
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~60MNTgnhmBE-TfcrYuxbLA~This particular time was at the Straiton Park Branch, Edinburgh and ok it was busy bus the pizza base was soggy when arrived - it could of been a little crispier for my tastes and so was my Friends.  I've had better to be honest.  Service was ok, a little forgetful after asking us if we wanted parmasen and black pepper - it was obvious the girl was serving others at the same time as us,~pizza ~2
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~L1wYu_fIb1bEL7DDZ5q_DQ~I confess I don't mind this place too much....   The menu is massive which leads to a bit of a 'Jack of all trades' type of cuisine...master of none. Although I have to say I love the Tomato & Garlic Pizza Bread here....just love it. It's the only thing I really 'go' here for. Other than that it's a quick fix when we're really hungry which means that we never do much tasting when we're in here.   I've had worse, you probably have too~tomato & garlic pizza ~3
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~VTAOPo37gaBDZnKVe2RGuA~I enjoyed my meal here on a Monday night recently and it's handy for the cinema. The jacket potato was perfect and the Apple & Rhubarb crumble was yum. Unfortunately, my fellow diner didn't enjoy his pancake desert and I wouldn't order the spicy onion rings again. They tasted too processed and chewy. It became busy because of the Monday Madness menu but I found it was a huge effort to get our waiter's attention the whole time we were there, especially when getting deserts and even when we tried to ask for the bill. We had to walk to the front desk to ask if we could leave (the film we were seeing was about the start!)~potato apple & rhubarb onion rings ~4
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~tos3MEAw9SUQkBcp_oIPyA~I visited Frankie and Bennys with my family for something to eat before going to a show at the nearby Playhouse theatre. The food was lovely, most of us opted for steak and it was cooked very well, as was the lamb shank my sister got.    The restaurant itself is family friendly and they play really nice old 50s music that goes well with the overall Italian / American diner theme they have going on.    The only downside to our meal was how long the service took. Knowing we were going to a show we allowed plenty of time (2 hours) before the show was to start. However we were still rushing to finish our main meals in time, purely because of how long it took us to get served.    I would certainly go back to Frankie and Bennys because the food was lovely, however only if I had nothing else planned that day!~steak lamb ~3
3xJ84rKp_xU-NuM0u8LnRw~lMuFKIwuZTJIAHTZGhlcCA~Let's all admit it, When you're at The Hard Rock Cafe or TGI's waiting on the massive pile of smoky, barbecued, fatty goodness to arrive can be a pretty exciting experience. American grub may not be haute cuisine but there is a place for ribs, barbecue chicken and huge burgers in anyone's diet.  Frankie and Bennie's is the poor relation to these chains, with a barely noticeable Italian influence added. I'll keep this brief: A burger is about a tenner, isn't as good as McDonalds, and you get a shockingly meagre portion of fries.  Not worth the bother.~ribs, chicken burgers burger fries. ~2
6IadUU3kr46yAbTKtWvQag~ioh0n7N5fhFBT2v4hMPZqQ~Came here for lunch today with my parents. I ordered a beef noodle soup noodle and a ja jiang mein.   Beef Noodle Soup The soup base was alright and so were the noodles itself but the meat was in huge chunks. It was also pretty dry and tough so that made it hard to eat. I wish they could have made it more tender and served it as smaller pieces instead. Since the meat was like that, I assume they probably boiled the meat.  Ja Jiang Mein Don't do it folks, don't order it. Traditional ja jiang mein is sweet. What I was given here was spicy and didn't taste like ja jiang mein at all. Ordering this would be something like walking into a Greek restaurant to order Chinese food. What you get will not be like the real thing.~beef soup beef soup soup ~2
6IadUU3kr46yAbTKtWvQag~_FndRQffmVHzi8PPmEr3rg~Moo Moo!  Moo Beef Noodles is a brand new beef noodle joint located inside the food court of Silver Star Blvd 國際美食廣場. This is not the same Moo Moo that used to be in the same plaza..  What caught my eyes were their offerings of House Extra Spicy Noodles with 3 different levels! My weakness for spicy food especially for a cold winter afternoon!   Homicide Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) was quite spicy according to my Yelp Friend. But it is basically their Beef Noodle Soup made spicy by adding bottled diced red chili, ended up I cannot taste their soup based much! The beef though was really tender and of good grade! Noodle though is really standard.  My suggestion would be just order the plain one and just add chili oil yourself, at least you can adjust your level. I saved my friend by eating the whole order....   I can smell stinky tofu... Yes if you are into stinky tofu! If you don't want to smell, you might want to stay far away from this stall....  I will be back to try some stinky tofu!~beef beef beef soup ( beef soup soup beef tofu... tofu! tofu! ~3
6IadUU3kr46yAbTKtWvQag~qVuWlzFcwacPxFu468JUbg~I ordered a 3-cup chicken on rice for lunch ($4.99).  The portion was insane (see picture).  The chicken tasted homey with strong flavour of ginger and a hint of garlic.  Wait, there were garlic pieces in the mix; I ate them anyway.  So authentic.  I tasted the soy sauce and dark soy sauce, but can't find the sesame oil aroma.    This dish was okay though I wish the sesame aroma was stronger.  The price vs portion ratio was very good though.~chicken chicken ginger garlic. garlic soy sauce soy sauce, ~3
6IadUU3kr46yAbTKtWvQag~9f8Q7FCjoVfO6Hev_IQ_0Q~The BF heard about this place off of redflagdeals.com and conveniently I had a dentist appointment in the area. We decided to drop by for dinner after since I'm a huge fan of noodles and stinky tofu.  It's a food court, so not very high expectations for service and atmosphere, but everything was clean and it was pretty quiet at 8pm on a Monday night. The Moo Beef booth is decorated really nicely with wooden plaques listing menu items, but only in Chinese. We were able to order in English but it would've been easier in Chinese for sure. The owner didn't seem to be overly fluent but the other girl (daughter?) was helpful.  We ordered two bowls of the classic Beef Noodles and a stinky tofu. I wanted to try their original broth before going for the spicy options, which would normally be my choice. Each bowl came topped with cilantro, bok choy, pickled cabbage and green onions. The noodles were thick and chewy, a good texture. The broth was salty but flavourful. There could have been a few more pieces of beef, but I did like the tendon and each piece was soft and tender. I was impressed with the stinky tofu, they were crispy and tasted great. Authentically stinky.~tofu. beef beef tofu. cilantro, cabbage beef, tofu, ~3
4vyBv1GY1n3hCZl7yd02og~CI6WexsiXiofh6FCxfgS7A~Ce petit restaurant est un incontournable de la rue Prince-Arthur. Ils offrent salades, pizzas, brochettes cuites sur charbon de bois, poutine et sandwichs. Un prix imbattable! Je mange toujours super bien pour à peine $10 (2 brochettes avec 2 salades).Pour les amateurs, ils offrent des brochettes de filet mignon et laissez-moi vous dire que c'est succulent. Et que dire du service que j'ai. Ils sont tellement accueillant et toujours super serviable. Maintenant que je suis un habitué, il prépare son charbon d'avance pour mes brochettes, pour être certain que je n'ai pas à attendre trop longtemps. Que demander de plus? Vous pouvez également vous réchauffer avec un bon café ou thé lors la température est fraiche. Aller y faire un tour et n'ayez pas peur de parler avec le personnel, ils sont si chaleureux.   This small restaurant is a must of the Prince Arthur Street. They offer salads, pizzas, skewers cooked on charcoal, poutine and sandwiches. Unbeatable price!

They are so welcoming and always super helpful. Now that I'm a regular customer, he prepares the charcoal in advance for my skewers, to be sure I don't have to wait too long. I can't ask for more! You can also warm up yourself with a cup of coffee or tea when the temperature is cool.

Customer service is not a strong value at this restaurant.~lettuce lettuce hamburger burgers ~1
6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ~MCMJdYpMv1_udQRmm35LAA~Maybe because it was NYE but workers were friendly. It's connected to a convenience store that also has a few slots and a gas station too. There's a lot of cars going in and out of the parking lot.  In general I think Jack In The Box is decent but this location was slightly disappointing because the fries were not warm and soft when I received it...they were room temperature and kind of crunchy.~fries ~3
6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ~87DfcSKcjbCr-qYaHhGNAw~Ok, we came here just because we had a 2 for $5 coupon for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. It looked tempting.   We picked it up in the drive-thru along with some curly fries. Cannot pass up curly fries since they are hard to come by. Jesus took our order and helped us at the window. Very professional and polite.   Got home and the food was super hot, and looked great. So many times you order fast food, only to bring it home and it looks nothing like the photos they advertise. Not this time. Lettuce and tomatoes looked great. Big piece of breaded, spicy chicken. As for spicy, it was fairly mild. I added their buttermilk ranch dressing, and it was great. Curly fries were hot, crunchy and wonderful.   Awesome!~chicken sandwich ~4
6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ~eQ_Jy3yiVIz2QB4YbQNl1g~My friends and I weren't happy that the order was late and when we received it, the portion was small. I said "these aren't medium, could i have more fries." The guy said it is medium and only gave more fries for 1 out the 3 orders. The soda fountain didn't work until the clerk pressed a control switch. The food didn't taste the same as I remembered.~fries. fries ~1
6Ege_N9uJ-rtKIs1TNA8aQ~sFzcIGkDZw4hIPczIagCCw~So of the dumbest people working there... You ask for a "Big Cheeseburger" plain, they give you bread and meat no cheese.  Oh and then you call them to fix it and they don't pickup the phone.  Their excuse is the company hasn't bought them a new $9 phone.  Terrible service!~cheese. ~1
68CwkDaqDpW6E7WiZcHqrQ~c9BGV1edZCtszh4wXJHD_w~I've been a member of this gym for a year to date and going during my lunch hour downtown has changed my life.  All of the exercise equipment is state of the art and has its own monitor for watching Law and Order while your run a quick 5K at lunch.  Or you can take one of their many lunch hour classes, and I've tried all of them.  All of the instructors are passionate and caring, from butts n' guts and spinning to yoga and Pilates, and they are all included with the $50/month membership, which  is a really great deal.    Downsides: the women's locker room is way too small, you are always bumping into someone while you change, but for the most part everyone is very considerate and friendly so it's not that big of a deal.  Also, because the classes are so great, you have to call in the morning to sign up and you won't always get a spot because I swear some people must be calling at 5am.  Overall, a really solid place to work out if you work downtown and have a decent lunch hour.~date ~4
1dAQDErfIsRsQWAeuyn3Cw~IGCF82V-oYJhymGcBiKWKQ~When one of our favorite Gilbert family businesses closed shop (Gelato del Cielo) we were very sad. But when we saw O Gelato open nearby, we thought "there is hope!" Alas, there is not.   This product is NOT gelato - it is just regular ice cream that someone decided to call gelato and stick into a tiny cup so they can charge an exuberant price. The flavors aren't at all exciting and it's just not the gelato we know and love. Gelato del Cielo had authentic gelato (which we discovered in Rome, Italy 2 years ago). It is too bad this place doesn't offer the good stuff.~ice cream ~1
1dAQDErfIsRsQWAeuyn3Cw~VFduh2DL9qeOAEdqi345JA~Yeah for yummy gelato!   My husband and I had a two-for-one coupon. The small gelato serving comes with two flavors. I got birthday cake and strawberry cheesecake, and he got pistachio and cappucino.   The decor is cute and modern. I like this place!~cake ~5

I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was delightfully tasty. But honestly I've had better. Same goes with their coffee as well.   I had the red, white and blue slam yesterday and it was okay. It's not as good as they advertise it on tv. It's a good thing they only offer it for a limited time.~coffee white ~4
5sUp6kl5qyRnA_0pRRAyqQ~Os8rWjpcL7e5IrEtZhYMVg~Worst service ever.  They are lucky I'm even giving them 1 star but the Cali Avocado Skillet dish was pretty tasty.  The waitress messed up our check and took forever for them to fix it.~avocado ~1
5sUp6kl5qyRnA_0pRRAyqQ~dArKzI00cmGXJePw89Zvrg~Came for a Grand Slam and it was the best Grand Slam I've ever had. They even made the bacon just the way I requested (very very well done, almost burnt without actually burning), which is rare because at most places I still get floppy bacon no matter what I say. The hostess was friendly, my waitress was friendly and efficient, and the dining area was clean and organized. Definitely want to come back to this location.~bacon bacon ~5
5sUp6kl5qyRnA_0pRRAyqQ~oRpOJx2Ov5KWahqEd3EP5w~Decide to go Denny's for my son's birthday, Yay he got a free breakfast.  The food was fine, very typical Denny's food. I has the biscuits and gravy and a scrambled egg. It was perfect, my son loved his breakfast as well. Will return for my birthday. The waitress was very nice, the food was warm. Just a nice simple place.~egg. ~4
5sUp6kl5qyRnA_0pRRAyqQ~Ic7Eyb_6k-bsfnxCNg8Y5g~Erin? I think his name was.  It started off great, he was super patient with my undecidedness. I hadn't eaten all day and everything sounded good!! He quickly brought a fresh iced coffee when I didn't even realize I slurped the first one down while purusing the menu.  After talking it over with Erin, we decided the breakfast burger was the ticket. Not sure what it was called, it was hasbrown, egg and bacon on a burger pattie.  Once I recieved my meal, Erin disappeared!!! He dropped off my ticket not 2 minutes after he gave me my food and magically fell off the earth. There was about 10 other waiters/waitress there, discussing what sounded like a meeting but was really just an excuse to sit and gossip.   Not one of these people asked if I needed anything else...which I did. Tobasco sauce would've been fantastic with my meal. The a/c was set to freeze your ass off, and that if you didn't finish your meal in 10mins, it would be cold.  Finally, I got up and paid for my meal when the hostess walked back to her station. Why do they ask if we want to add anything more to the original bill? There's a spot for us to write that in when they hand us the recipt. Sounded fishy. Besides, I try and tip in cash anyway, which I only left a couple bucks. Erin was attentive...in the begining.  Will not be back.~coffee burger egg bacon burger ~2

Beautiful and modern, with flexible spaces for cocktails, dinner and dancing. The staff executed our event flawlessly! They are professional, efficient and easy to work with. They took care to make sure everything was as we wanted it to be.   The food is catered by the on-site restaurant, Steenbock's on Orchard. The appetizers and our meals were just delicious, interesting and well-executed! I heartily recommend!~appetizers ~5
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~DgIwhrunQZ4cuwU6vCA--Q~Prices are certainly right here, but as far as I'm concerned it's pretty subpar.  The woman taking our order wasn't particularly friendly, the "grande" burrito is probably half the size of a chipotle burrito and wasn't flavorful.  As other reviewers have said they barely give you any chips...I counted 7/8.  I would go here again and maybe give it another chance, but I'll stick to chipotle (which is sad, because I had high hopes for this place).~burrito burrito chips... ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~kOxlncxF1cbLuWV1PO5VbA~Are you a college student, or just a hungry person on a budget, wandering around Oakland craving Mexican food?  Skip the chain crap and visit Veracruz, conveniently located right between the Chipotle and the Q'Doba (and far better than anything either have to offer).  Pitt students, or anyone who looks like a student pretty much, even get a discount off the already low prices.  Portions are amply sized, and the burritos come in three different sizes unlike the horse-choker-fits-all style of the big chains.  Most of the best stuff on the menu isn't inside a burrito wrapper though, read over the whole menu and ask about any specials if you're unfamiliar, lots of good stuff to be had!  Plenty of hot sauce options on the table or the shelf, tasty imported sodas and juices to wash down your meal (including real homemade horchata) and if you're into either - you can always count on soccer or Hispanic soap operas (or both) being on the TV while you wait.~burritos burrito ~3
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~LBEwE8HcBoYNLsFRIh2Cfg~It's a hit or a miss. I usually order some tacos and they are always great. Last time, I ordered an enchilada with mole sauce it was absolutely disgusting. They microwaved the meat and some pieces were cold. I usually love the chips but they were stale that day. Pros: The staff is very friendly and their food is 10x tastier and cheaper than Chipotle.~tacos enchilada chips ~3
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~Ti6T0fggBmFlnaA9BpP7Qg~I was hoping by the look of this place that it would be more authentic, but I was disappointed.  I got the chicken chili burrito and it was fine but not great and nothing particularly interesting about it.  It definitely did not taste authentic and there were no choices about what toppings or salsas to put in it.  I ordered a side of guac that was super tiny and it seemed fresh but had no flavor at all to it.  My 2 friends ordered a veggie burrito and a fish burrito, respectively but they switched them up and gave them the wrong orders.  Unfortunately my vegetarian friend didn't realize the mistake until he was several bites into the fish burrito and he was really upset after eating it and felt ill since he hasn't eaten meat in over 10 years.  Also the burritos are much smaller than what you get at Chipotle or Qdoba, even for their larger "grande" size and the prices are similar.  Also the tables were not very comfortable, there wasn't much seating, and the temperature inside was pretty cold on a Winter day.~chicken burrito burrito burrito, burrito burritos ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~HiF_CkNhmXeNb9yPkQJ60A~I first went here about a year ago and had a very unimpressive enchilada - the experience was enough to keep me away until yesterday. Having gotten tired of the tacos at nearby Chipotle, I decided to give Veracruz another chance. I got chicken tacos which were made quickly and came in double corn tortillas with a small bag of delicious tortilla chips. Certainly not the best tacos in town, but passable! I will probably be back for more on a semi regular basis.~enchilada - tacos chicken tacos corn tortillas tortilla chips ~3

I can't say enough about it! I miss the black bean burrito to this day. Cheap prices, huuuge burritos, and you gotta love that 10% Pitt student discount!! Try the guac and chips, also - AMAZING guac. One complaint -- they never give you enough chips, but I went in so often that they'd usually give me a second bag for free without even asking. Love!!~burrito burritos, chips, chips, ~5
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~Y_5sllxhABRbmSl4JhUPEQ~Veracruz makes an effort to distinguish itself from the standard big burrito or Tex Mex chains, and these efforts  pay off.  Chorizo, barbacoa, and al pastor double wrapped tacos are now on the menu, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes like chilaquiles and sopes. Authentic Mexican food is a rare find in Oakland (let alone Pittsburgh), so these tasty dishes make Veracruz worth a visit.   If you're unfamiliar with the aforementioned foods, I suggest you dive in and try them regardless of your personal reservations. Otherwise, Veracruz is simply average in terms of Americanized Mexican fare, such as nachos, quesadillas, and burritos. I actually prefer nearby Chipotle or Qdoba for Ameri-Mex. On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.  Relatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess). Service varies highly depending on who's taking your order.~burrito chorizo, barbacoa, tacos chilaquiles sopes. nachos, quesadillas, burritos. chicken avocado cake ( nachos, ~4
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~_TbFgEmyZ5oWdGJDe-unTQ~One of the few places you can get horchata (cinnamon/rice milk) and exotic candies (at the counter).   It's pretty mediocre Mexican food for the most part, but compared to what else you can get nearby, probably the most homegrown you can get.~milk) ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~IvQjpQVO_8yAzbv3Wowgzw~I agree with Kit's assessment - mediocre food in general, but much better than Qdoba and Chipotle, the only other options for Mexican food nearby.  The portions are pretty big - a grande quesadilla was almost too much for me to handle, and I was starving.  The sauteed veggies were a nice touch (black beans, onion & I think zucchini) but I would have liked a bit more cheese.  The Mexican rice was very authentic and took me right back to a little restaurant in Buenavista - pink, tasted of chicken stock, studded with peas.  The chips seemed a little stale and the salsa wasn't the greatest, but the entire meal (grande quesadilla with chips & salsa, side of rice, and a soda) was less than $7.  Even though it's not great food, it's cheap and a good value.  I would definitely recommend Veracruz over the chain Mexican places.~black beans, onion & zucchini) cheese. chicken peas. chips salsa chips & salsa, ~3
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~rX_r1wODTR1coDD6DwLalg~Being from California I have been spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Here, I ordered a steak burrito and a horchata. The burrito was small for the price but the horchata was nice; I don't know anywhere else where you could get it. The burrito was bland and not filling. There aren't many chips given and they too were flavorless. Pitt students do get 10% off with ID but sadly I'd recommend Chipotle or Qdoba over Veracruz.~steak burrito burrito burrito chips ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~EjwYTFBXB0WdJLNR0XZ0OQ~Cheap, fast, tasty, gives student discounts. The stuffed baked potatoes are delicious, the chips are fresh, and did I mention it's cheap? Very worth a quick lunch run.~chips ~4
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~fOxNPecgvNHAk7CEQUZDOw~Terrible. I had a small burrito which was mostly tortilla. Flavorless cubes of chicken. Flavorless salsa. Just bad.~burrito chicken. salsa. ~1
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~R6Ea37uvxo6NgpJpJehFDg~I've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito. However, I can do better myself (and in fact, every time I go by this place I think I should quit my job and open a near-campus taco stand).   The chicken tinga burrito was quite good and pretty close to California style. The burrito portions are small enough to finish and not make you too fat, which is a plus I think.  Nachos are likewise quite good. Good for sharing, disappear fast.  However, this place serves the worst enchiladas I've had in long time. Decent tortillas and shredded chicken filling, but the sauce is canned and they top them with wilted lettuce and cheese that is dry and crumbly like parmesan in a can. Ick.  Also, the stools are really uncomfortable, and they serve their sodas in styrofoam cups.~burrito. taco chicken burrito burrito nachos tortillas chicken lettuce cheese ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~Uuq3Iay_vXP9nYe1f9iHMA~It is pretty tough to make bland Mexican food, but this place succeeds. My burrito was filled with salty mush. The pink(?!?) rice was way overcooked, to the point of congee. The grilled chicken (yea right!) showed no resemblance of ever seeing a grill, and had no flavor at all. They did add a teaspoon of salsa, but it wasn't nearly enough to fix the lack of flavor with all the other components. The 6 chips (yes, I counted) were stale to the point where nobody would want to eat them. Some flavorful salsa, guacamole, cheese, creme fresh, vegetables, etc. would have made the burrito way better.  They don't have pork on the menu. The portions are small. Food is bland, poorly cooked, stale.~burrito chicken ( salsa, chips ( salsa, cheese, burrito pork ~1
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~nfDvIBmVgnFOWrzdwQrxbg~OH!  I could get fat from their chips and salsa!  I love going to Veracruz for lunch!  I work in Oakland and have a number of "mexican" restaurants at my disposal (including big chain Chipotle and Qdoba) but will 9 times out of 10 go for the 'Cruz!  It's so much more authentic.  I feel like the chef's only speak Spanish (at least that's how the cashier communicates with them) and there is always some Spanish soap opera or talk show on adding to it's authenticity.  Never usually packed- it's quick and filling.  Totally worth a try!  -10% off for students (or appearing to be under 22) -Free chips and salsa with my takeout order everytime -Cheap and delicious  Loves it...~chips salsa! chips salsa ~4
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~a192WGmVulTWW7Qr-ESyqQ~I've only been to Veracruz once, and I don't think I'll be giving them a second chance. The veggie burrito was sad with undercooked pink rice and flavorless veggies. I'd rather have Chipolte, which is good in a standardized sort of way.   Maybe there is decent 'authentic' Mexican food in Pittsburgh, but you're not going to find it here.~burrito ~2
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~uQ9jif87pgHsygb91T1v3g~I was a little skeptic of the pink rice but it's actually pretty good. Actually, everything I've ordered has been really tasty.   I have one complaint and that is the tortilla chips they give with your order. Yes, they are complimentary but you get  5 and they are almost always stale. That being said, if you want chips and salsa or guacamole then walk on over to Qdoba or Chipotle,but if you want enchilladas or a stuffed poblano pepper, Veracruz is your place!~tortilla chips ~3
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~FjFeInRmWs-34HO1aC0EjA~The worst Mexican food I've ever had.  I thought I'd try it based on some positive reviews on here, and my desire to avoid chain restaurants.  Unfortunately it was terrible and made me wish I'd gone to either Chipotle or QDoba nearby.  The burritos are made with pink rice and I found a pea in mine.  It came with a bag of 5 poorly salted tortilla chips, and some flavorless salsa.  I'd rather still feel hungry and have my money.~burritos tortilla chips ~1
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~OYsiTyPNWLPSWK3RHKgQfA~Pretty good veggie burrito I prefer Chipotle because theirs feels larger and watching it being made makes it more appetizing. Nonetheless this tasted good and the lady at the counter was pretty nice. I did a takeout cos the seating did not look particularly welcoming.. high stools and tables. This place has got the food right, but needs to work on quantity and ambience.. and also have a printed menu which clearly marks out the vegetarian items.~burrito ~3
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~L9tzZx64yFvvRCbNzhc1zQ~a great favorite. They give student ID Discounts as well. Probably the best burrito in the burgh until we get a real taco truck.~burrito taco ~4
6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ~YpcjxkskW6POqu5UJXUlDQ~Don't; get me wrong, this is not a gourmet restaurant. But it's not supposed to be. If you want some of the cheapest, most delicious Mexican food in Pittsburgh, this is where you want to be. It's an unassuming, unattractive restaurant front on Forbes Ave, but do not let appearances fool you. This is one of the few places left I know of that can give you a delicious, filling meal for under 5 bucks. I've been eating the same thing (grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla) for almost two years now, and I will never get sick of it. They give you an automatic 10% discount if you look like a student, which you can't beat. Plenty of hot sauces to try on your food as well! My absolute favorite place to eat lunch quickly in Oakland.  If you don't know what to get, know that the grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla has a very good shot at changing your life.~chicken chicken ~5
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~tlam7ORKz4Qj8aky8AtB2A~Maybe I shouldn't have eaten at Grand Electric on Monday and then waited 15-20 minutes for lunch at this food truck on Thursday in Toronto's sweltering heat. Why frustrate myself with the wait and then subject myself to an insurmountable taco benchmark? And after being in SF's Mission District just weeks ago?  The truck is an interesting concept, because it serves a different menu from Buster's at the St. Lawrence Market, which I ate at on Friday (very good, by the way).  The truck has the finger food / rolls concept - fish tacos ( $8 for two), shrimp tacos, crab roll, lobster roll ($13).   I got the fish  tacos. Pretty heavily fried. The fish was fine but nothing compared to the light airiness and freshness of Grand Electric, Playa Cabana, or the permanent location of Buster's in the Market. The fixings were pretty fresh - tomatoes, cabbage, etc...several hot sauces available free of charge. The shell - a soft shell which was crisped on the grill a bit - was a major disappointment - a bit awkward to eat, and not tasty.  Maybe the lobster roll is the thing to get here - if you have lofty fish taco standards like me, I'd avoid the fish tacos though.~taco tacos ( shrimp tacos, lobster roll ( tacos. cabbage, lobster roll taco tacos ~2
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~sPPWoEJanC7Vr5nn64Dy5Q~My first food truck review!  I've only had the fish taco.  The fish is nicely fried with good flavours, sauce had a good kick! The only part I didn't like is the bread/wrap, it was way too starchy, took away from the whole experience.   The good part I guess was I didn't have to wait in line. I had this at the Veld past month. The price was reasonable and I would go back for more if I see it. :)~taco. ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~tAQLSaoIj2UfnN2IFLWylw~Discovering this food truck at the CNE this past summer started my quest to find the best  Lobster Roll in Toronto. Though I have been unable to locate this food truck since, I was glad that I waited in the long line to try Buster Sea Cove.   The Lobster Roll was smaller then I would have liked, and I would have preferred fries instead of the Miss Vickies chips, but the roll itself was fantastic! The fill was smooth but had enough chunks of lobster in it to know that I was actually eating lobster. The buttered bun was toasty, and just accentuated the flavour of the lobster meat contained inside.  Next stop for me is to try the St. Lawrence location!~lobster roll lobster roll fries chips, ~4
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~I4UGSTyYpUicKoZ461D9cg~Went to the food truck version that was out at the Sony Centre.  Reasonably priced.  Ordered the fish taco, 2 for $10 and received a free chip bag, nice toss in.  When I received the taco, the ratio of fish to everything was way off.  The fish was too big to fit per bite in proportion to smaller corn tortilla it was sitting upon. The salsa, punchy, tangy, spicy.  Maybe greater in smaller amount.  Overall, not overly impressed, but it was barely passable.~taco, taco, corn salsa, ~2
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~YawEJvHw5gvNq1OLkAQLGg~I had a great experience with this food truck. They were at celebration square on Canada day and the line up wasn't huge. Ordered the shrimp and ahi tuna tacos and the key lime pie in a jar. Amazing!!!! Awesome!!! I appreciate that they take your order with your name and call out your name when it is prepared. Very personal, as opposed to a numbered system.   The food came out warm and delicious, which stayed warm whilst looking for a place to post out with the busy Canada day crowd.  Wow, when I first tasted the shrimp tacos, utterly taken aback! Such crispy shrimp with a spicy batter, tasty coleslaw type filling.  The taste was unique and on point. The ahi tuna was thick, delicious and seared perfectly.  Again, amazing blend of flavours. The taco shells were delicious and fresh.  Salsa was delicious, fresh tomatoes, and onions (can't tell what else it's made of but just deliciousness). Yum.  Fantastic medley of flavours and textures.  The tacos also came with three small slices of lime, they don't play around they give you enough to juice up your tacos.  They also give you good quality thick napkins.   For desert, had the key lime pie in a jar. I love that idea! Especially for a food truck, it's great on the go, really keeps it clean while eating on the go. Would make a great present too. Beautiful packaging complete with a cute green ribbon and bow :).  The cost of the two tacos are ten dollars and the key lime pie was eight dollars, tax inclusive.  Would definitely try again!~shrimp tuna tacos lime pie shrimp tacos, shrimp coleslaw tuna taco salsa tacos lime, tacos. lime pie tacos lime pie ~5
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~KVsUX84sz6jXJ9PmMLzmDg~3.5 Stars  VIBE This is a review for their food truck. I had this at the Beaches Jazz Fest so it was a welcome reprieve not to have to wait in line for eons as I would have at TUM or elsewhere. Staff were quick, on the ball and friendly.   THE GOODS I got the lobster roll and unlike the competition, it's not doused in mayo. It's super fresh lobster and you get quite a good portion of it but not enough to feel super full. Maybe that's why they give you the chips? (which a bag of Miss Vickie's alongside just seems kind of cheap. Sorry).  You also get a big ass dill pickle which I like. Slather some of that all of my lobster, please and thanks! I feel like the lobster could use a wee bit more flavouring but they don't want to distract from it either. It's a delicate balance.   That said, even though the lobster is delicious (and maybe it's just the cost of importing it), it's just expensive at $13. Get rid of the chips and charge $8 to $10 for that sucker and you'll double your volume. I can get a Keg Prime Rib Burger with TWO sides in a brick and motar restaurant for the same price (compartively speaking...I know it's not lobster but still).   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Swim to the ocean...but you'll be paying for it. Curious about their tacos. Maybe next time. They're much more reasonable at $8 for two sizeable portions.~lobster roll chips? chips burger tacos. ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~XiciFqPssspl3hkOsAKAIQ~The truck was by my work and I had a terrible craving for shrimp so I ordered the shrimp po boy.  I've never had an authentic po boy down south and my only comparison is with a po boy made by a friend who attempted to make it as authentic as possible (as she had travelled down to NOLA and fell in love with the food).  Cons: The bread is some sort of a garlic loaf, so definitely not authentic.  Pros: The shrimp was HUGE so totally made up for the price of the sandwich (I think it was $10?) All in all, great flavour and I would order it again, just don't expect a shrimp "po boy" as it's more of a sandwich.~shrimp shrimp garlic shrimp sandwich ( shrimp " sandwich. ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~anh6RAd2l2OckRtvFxahkg~They don't seem to be around much so I've only managed to eat from this truck once. The fish taco was very tasty  but there wasn't a lot to it.~taco ~4
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~7v5XCwhcLJE217ZgZKkwFg~I've been to the Busters truck a couple of times. The first time I went I got the lobster roll, as I was quite excited about it. (as I love lobsters rolls). It is tasty, but it is quite small. This makes sense as lobster is not exactly cheap. It comes with a pickle and a bag of Miss Vicky's chips. This is needed due to the size of the roll, and I am glad they understand this. The best part of the lobster roll though is not the lobster itself, but the buttery bun they put it on. I have also taken part in the shrimp tacos there, and they were good and more filling than the lobster roll...  Overall, the product tastes good, but because it's not a portion I can feel full on it's not a place I would frequent regularly. I have opted to stick to making my own lobster rolls... but for those of you who don't want to go through that hassle, this roll is at least better than what they offer at 416 Snack Bar :)~lobster roll, chips. lobster roll shrimp tacos lobster roll... ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~kCWWB0tR5lImD6bAfEjihg~I had the lobster roll for lunch and although at $13 it was twice the price of a McLobster, it was definitely better tasting and well, I didn't have to drive all the way to the Maritimes to have it.  The lobster roll comes on a folded sliced bread (folded from the factory, I might add - I don't know how else to describe this, you just have to see it) which is buttered and toasted. The lobster is shredded and mixed with light mayo and chives and other herbs. It comes with a bag of Ms. Vickies chips, two quartered pickles, and a slice of lemon.  I didn't have the fish tacos ($8 for two) but my friend did and the fish was heavily battered and the tortilla got soggy and fell apart halfway through. Didn't look very appealing to me but he said it tasted good.  I like how their pricing includes the tax already.  Tip: Don't go visit the food trucks when the weather says "Feels like 40 degrees".~lobster roll lobster roll chips, pickles, lemon. tacos ( ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~mNc0E_N_bE69reXmp_Adyw~Maybe it was the evening of Nuit Blanche or colder weather but the fish tacos were so-so. Big pieces of fish but by the time we got them, they were cold and lacking in flavour.~tacos ~2
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~2GCt2bv0AeVwTvdMP4QIiQ~Lately I've been making an effort to visit the current food trucks popping up. One friday afternoon I was out of work early and caught busters before they closed up shop at 3pm. I rolled up around 230pm and most of the menu was crossed out. To my advantage they still had some fish tacos.   Now I've read the other reviews prior to posting this, and ill have to agree, the fish is battered pretty heavily and the taco shells fall apart, but the latter is not because of the heat, they put the salsa and cabbage underneath the meat! Who thought this was the right way to build a taco? I mean, if you want to do that, add a second shell (which is quite normal at most taqueria's south of canada). However, buster had all the ingredients right for making tacos. I hope they continue it.  For the record, the mission district in sf is know for it's burritos, not tacos.~tacos. taco salsa cabbage taco? tacos. burritos, tacos. ~3
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~UC6jywfa8j-ThVHbEvEtGw~I saw the Buster's Seacove truck on FoodTV, so was excited to try it. All i can say is the pictures do not tell the whole picture. The portion size are very small, you can finish the tacos and the rolls in literally a couple of bites. The taste is good and refreshing, but the portion is such a turn down for me. I understand seafood is pricy,  and you are paying for the convenience, but at least i'm somewhat full with the other food trucks. Not too impressed with Buster's~tacos ~2
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~bZY2g4r5lKW9cM5XhVVXfw~Yes!  Fish tacos!  Yes!  Lobster roll!  Yes!  Octopus taco?!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!! I visited this truck at CraveTO.  After being ripped off, foolishly paying the $15 entry fee, my feelings were comforted by Buster's offerings.  The octopus taco was fantastic, with tender bits of lovingly cut octopi nestled in a fresh mini tortilla.  If it were not such a bright sunny day, I'd eat five.  In  a row.  However, I stopped at one, and am slightly disappointed that I did.   I'll return to step up to that challenge.   Until then, Buster.~tacos! lobster roll! taco? taco ~4
6CmrVgQVGozVwcOK6-KgNA~u_f0GkswdH1_YTHu5Y8ftA~Last year I finally jumped on the food truck bandwagon. I must admit, this was mostly due to a matter of convenience since food trucks were parking themselves within walking distance from work and home.   I was extremely excited to hear that RBC Plaza would be "featuring" food trucks in front of their building during the summer months. One highly anticipated food truck to make its appearance was Buster's Sea Cove.   The trucks are usually there from 11am-3pm or until they sell out of product. I've gone to buster's food truck twice, both times they ran out of lobster roll fixings. The lines are always long from 12-2. It's best to go early to avoid the long wait (1130ish) and if you go after 2 you run the risk of having only a limited selection of food to choose from (ie no lobster rolls).  I ordered 1 crab roll which came with a small bag of Miss Vicki's chips and a pickle on the side.  The portion size of the meal was disappointingly small. The roll was essentially 1 regular piece of wonder bread, toasted, and folded in half with the crab stuffing in the middle.The crab roll itself was delicious in taste consisting of creamy, buttery, salty Alaskan crab! It left me salivating and wanting more.   Overall, $10 for 1 slice of bread seems kind of an absurd amount of money to spend on a small sandwich but I suppose a good argument can be made that it's not the bread you are paying for but the crab and also the quality of taste that the overall crab roll has to offer. I don't know if I would be willing to wait in another long line up for such a small sized meal that I find to be overpriced but I do still want to try their lobster rolls and I hear they are opening a location in the PATH http://bustersseacove.ca/blog/busters-sea-cove-is-coming-to-the-path/ . Huzzah! CONVENIENCE!!!~lobster roll chips sandwich ~3

Service was mediocre due to the fact that only one waitress was serving the whole place during Saturday morning. The only thing they are able to make decent is flipped eggs and bacon.

It wasn't too busy when I went there and there was only one waitress serving. I was happy with the fast and polite service. The restaurant was very colorfully designed with typical tutti fuiti decor. Lots of hens and farm animals will keep you company in case you come in for a coffee alone in the morning.

In my humble opinion the worse issue with breakfast restaurant are that they use shortcut. Frying rissole potatoes that's one lousy one. Having some industrial bechamel et putting mozzarella for a Florentine eggs is just wrong! You need Gruyere. Of pancake that are in fact american pancake which are way more thick and in my opinion almost taste like Eggo Waffles.  Anyway shortcuts is never the answer, otherwise you might as weel stay at home  Celui ou j'allais est fermé pour insalubrité! Et pis j'ai en horreur les resto-dejeuners qui prennent des stupides raccourcis!

5biLALSxThJmSfBUyPCY9g~Ewcg1xpoLJ8rkKfYTG-7Ew~I am the recipient of roses from All Occasion Floral. They were delivered yesterday for my birthday. I was out all day, but received a message from the owner, letting me know that she left an arrangement behind the planter by my front door. That was a great touch, as had I not received that message, the flowers would probably still be sitting there, frozen dead. Who ever goes through their front door in Arizona? :-) The flowers were beautiful. There were 1 dozen white roses, (my personal favorite). I did find the packaging a little odd however. They were just wrapped in plastic, like at the grocery store and left on the floor. I never had flowers delivered before that were not either in a box or a vase. The flowers were beautiful, but they were on the verge of opening. They opened completely today and are still beautiful, but now they will be ready to throw out in a day or two when they start dropping petals, turning brown on the edges and dying out. I've always received roses that were still quite closed on arrival, so that they lasted at least a week and you got a longer time to enjoy them. I will be disappointed when I have to throw these out so soon, therefore, between the packaging (or lack thereof) and the longevity of this batch, I have deducted 1 star.  I would definitely give them another chance tho, as the customer service seemed over and above the norm.~white brown ~4

7SfpjStnkYSPZwEDSklHWA~NCOwykPBCcb4BCeI1hmG5A~Not great.  Some mediums and some lows:  Ceviche - not that great.  Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well. Beef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry.  Seasoning was not noticeable. Carne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry.  Nothing memorable though. Chips and Salsa Bar - the best part.  Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a "spicy" red, and a "smokey" red. Tacos al Pastor - not that good. Rice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out.  I do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream.  All in all, qualifies as a "Never Again" stop.  P.S.  Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either.~ceviche - beef tacos - beef carne asada - chips salsa salsa, tacos al pastor - sour cream. ~2
7SfpjStnkYSPZwEDSklHWA~kOcJzjZYJ5qE69Q-ULlZRA~Let me start by saying if I could give it NO stars then I would have done that. Moving on to the review.... So my coworkers and I head here for lunch today..go in check out the menu which is quite small and limiting but whatever..decide to order a bacon breakfast burrito..go up to counter and ask if it has potatoes in it.. the girl replies with yes and I say "okay good" order my burrito/ drink (side bar -- they have their drinks behind the counter and I had to wait for the girl to finish taking the rest of lines order to get my drink..annoying but okay). The three people im with all order AFTER me and then ALL get their food. Im waiting..waiting.. after about 10 ish minutes and my friends PLUS all the people after me getting their food I go up and ask where my burrito is...they all look around at each other and are like "ummmm we accidentally gave it to a car in the drive thru" so my first thought is...IF YOU REALIZE THIS WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE ANOTHER ONE!? Whatever. The worst is yet to come. Get my burrito..yes, its piping hot. So I take a bite..hmm no potatoes and by being the freak I am; I then decide to open it up and look...nope, no potatoes. Roll it back up and decide to eat it because im starving. Well after about 2 bites grease just comes POURING out..im not talking a little bit a grease..a TON of it!! I have ate at Filly's/ Los Favoritos/Someburros all these kind of places and NEVER HAVE EVER ON ANYTHING experienced SO MUCH GREASE. I put down the burrito and my hands were covered in grease, my napkins, plate. Too disgusting to eat. So by now all my friends are done anyways and I just threw it away. It was only 5 bucks...but they will never get my 5 bucks again. Also, I was talking to a seperate co-worker on my way out of the office about this place and she said there was one by her house but it closed down! Should have taken it as a sign......... NEVER AGAIN! Another thing, if you were wondering......my other friends that did not have my experience got rolled tacos, tacos and a torta.. the general consensus was that it was meh. Not worth going back for.~bacon breakfast burrito ~1
7SfpjStnkYSPZwEDSklHWA~Yu21ZKdOD86AJLEMF9u8Rg~Salsitas is a different style of mexican food (San Luis de Potosi/Michoacan) . I thought the beans and rice were delicious! I've had the chili rellenos, they were good but could've had more cheese inside, the sauce on top had very good flavor.  The carne asada torta was good and it was two meals for me. The carne asada should be chopped up because it was to tough to bite through. But, otherwise my experience was great. Service was great and they were extremely friendly!~cheese carne asada carne asada ~4
7SfpjStnkYSPZwEDSklHWA~usN7slZsOzO3475oPz-12w~Salsitas is a HUGE step up from the disgusting and poorly managed KFC that was here before it, and while I couldn't be more happy to have a new Mexican joint near my house, there's really nothing amazing about it. The carne asada is about on par with most of the "bertos" around town, the portions are a little smaller than Filibertos, and the prices are about what you would expect. The only above average thing is their hot sauce, it's smokey and wonderful. I'll certainly be back, I like to spread my Mexican food love around the town, but they opened right next to a Filibertos, a bold move and all, but I just like Filis more.~carne asada ~3
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~0pj_SxIreDLHiJ2JEnhzEA~I've been really into froyo since trying Pinkberry on my various trips to LA. I've been on the hunt for something close back here in AZ. I've read the previous reviews and I think they must have improved a lot of the problems since I've discovered it because I haven't been aware of any of them.  I think this place is the best in froyo against the Mojo and Yogurtland I've visited. I like that they have a variety of flavors but am bummed when I go in and they don't have them. As long as they have the original tart I can be happy.  My favorite flavors are green apple and mango, and the fruit is always fresh and sweet. The place is decorated like any other cute little froyo joint and the girl behind the counter is always nice. Although I can't imagine what it must be like when it's packed and people are asking for samples because whenever I go in it's not busy.  Overall, it's a low-key and tasty froyo spot. It's a bit far from where I live but it's worth the drive for good frozen yogurt. I also dig the reward point system they have - it definitely makes the trip a bit better.~apple mango, frozen yogurt. ~4
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~zWC51qGrXzo1r_C7T2SirA~The yogurt here is extremely runny and watery. I basically have a bowl of ice cream soup by the time I reach my car in the parking lot. I understand that the fact that it's 110 degrees outside has something to do with this, but I've been to about four other yogurt shops in the past few weeks and I never have this problem. I understand slight melting, but it is extreme here. Are they doing this on purpose to save money?   Oh plus they got rid of the Fruity Pebbles. Big mistake. I know Fruity Pebbles are light and don't make them as much money as strawberries and other fruit do, but they are a great topping. Bring them back!~ice cream soup ~2
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~BpSQCrzJT8AegcTbOiB6jA~Another Frozen Yogurt Joint..........   They have similar setup as most places now days, serve your self, $.39 cents per oz .   Original Tart and a handful of other flavors.  I tried a sample of the Taro flavor, it was interesting.   Then decided on the Original Tart and Blueberry.  The Tart was not tart at all and the blueberry which wasn't sugar free and all natural was way too sweet, go figure.   I did not enjoy it and I was bummed.  They did have fresh fruit though :-)   They are brand new maybe things will change.   I'm sure there will be people who will enjoy this yogurt but it's not one of my favorites.~frozen yogurt taro ~2
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~Xt7aYKTzvjg_FxAptQ-hyw~Very excited to have a frozen yogurt so close to me! Zwirl is basically the same as Mojo, Yogurtini, Yo Yo: Self serve, weight your cup and pay. They had different flavors that change (don't know if daily, weekly?)   I had the taro and summer bliss. Loved the taro, creamy and it does taste like taro. Summer bliss was a nice citrusy tropical fruit mix, tart and refreshing. I tried the original tart but didn't like it as much.  Fruit toppings were fresh, I had strawberries:)  I hope they don't close so I can have fro yo easily accessible:)~frozen yogurt taro taro, taro. ~4
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~YVB9Q2DFC30LUj4skj-u-w~I saw another frozen yogurt shop opening here in Ahwatukee (why were there so few for a while? California has so many and Arizona has so few - makes no sense) and I was hoping they would have tart yogurt like Pink Berry, or at least like MoJo's and lucky me, they did!   I looked on-line before they opened and saw they had a twitter account and on that it said for their grand opening weekend yogurt was buy-one-get-one half off so we all went in on a Saturday afternoon looking for just that.   They place is very small, but decorated well with green tile and all the yogurt machines are in the walls. Unlike MoJo's, when you come in the door and do it all your self here the yogurt girls want to serve you the samples themselves (for all I know, maybe even the yogurt). We asked about the BOGO and the girl had no idea about so she went to ask her manager. She came out and said the manager would only do it with the coupon so I had to explain that twitter doesn't come with a coupon and their tweet said nothing about a coupon.  So she had to go back to get the manager to intervene.  (Check out their tweet on August 16 at 4:02 pm http://twitter.com/ZwirlYogurt) She argued with me for a while and I understood where she was coming from, she obviously wasn't in charge of the twitter account, but come on. You need to be aware of what's going on with your business. She conceded and said that she could do it for us and to let us know when we were ready and she would personally ring us up.   At that point we had sampled a couple of flavors here and there waiting for answers and we weren't too impressed. The original tart was bland. I know that's what you would expect, but it's not bland at MoJo's or Pink Berry's. Kind of like the difference of fat free ice cream compared to the real thing (only this is all fat free). I also tried the tart pomegranate and that also tasted like it was missing something. My husband tried a couple too and that alone seemed to satisfy him. I just took a lick off my sample cups and gave the rest to the toddler so he was in heaven so after all that we decided the yogurt just wasn't worth it BOGO or not and we left. Sadly we won't be back. We'll stick with Golden Spoon and when I'm lucky to be close enough to MoJo's, I'll get my fix there. That being said, I hope they do well, I don't want to see any businesses fail.~frozen yogurt ice cream pomegranate ~2
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~oMfUIpWkX15xMq3fft9vug~I'm not saying this place is bad, but it doesn't really differentiate itself from any other yogurt shop.  You pour yogurt in your tub and add toppings; they weigh it and you pay for it...pretty simple concept.  I rather enjoyed my smoothie.  Service is pretty good.  I think they have a great location - right outside the theaters.  There's not a lot of chairs indoor and the outdoor has a small patio.  If you're a yogurt freak I gather you should stop by and take a gander.  Otherwise any yogurt shop would do.  Enjoy!~smoothie. ~2
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~4NoQtc0GrXy__As-UN4Xqg~Zwirl is always packed with crazy kids running around everywhere! I am not a fan of self-serve frozen yogurt because I have witnessed customers put their fingers in the yogurt machines and touch toppings with their fingers. Zwirl's flavors aren't anything special...the yogurt is icy and not as creamy as other yogurt shops. I would recommend Golden Spoon over this any day.~frozen yogurt ~1
2D9HYhj-psnzFEEybFNljQ~Sj2PkJWKda5P4USMn5EVCQ~Ugh. We were all so excited to try the new yogurt place after sushi and a movie! My 15 year old and 10 year old boys love yogurt and couldn't wait! I can't believe how bad it was. The smell inside was HORRIBLE!! I finally had to wait outside because the smell was that bad. We got in the car to drive home and my 10 year old asked if I would be upset if he didn't like his yogurt! I had to laugh...I couldn't eat mine either! The hubby and 15 year old ate theirs but said they wouldn't go back..yikes!~sushi ~1
9DfSK6PUG4qHzuMfIYDxBA~1rIFXlrTf2MoxuU2XjTMqg~Living in the area, my husband and I thought to give this salon a try, as opposed to our usual place all the way Downtown, hoping to become regular customers.  Staff are welcoming and very friendly.  The interior is very nice; clean.  Parking is odd.. There is this shady looking lot in the back; thankfully street parking was available and we were able to find a spot without too much trouble.  Reason for one star???? The cut.  Who cares how friendly the staff is, how chic the interior is if they can't execute a haircut properly or at the very least LISTEN to what the customer is requesting??    I came in with an angled bob that was slightly grown out as the ends were touching my shoulders.  The stylist was asked to TRIM this back so that the ends were no longer touching my shoulders, just sitting above them. That's it.  Keep the exact same haircut that I came in with, however, clean it up.  I showed her two photos of how the cut looked like when I had first had it down and she even repeated 'give it a trim and clean it up'.   Great. We are on the same page.  For the angled cuts, the patron is asked to look down so that their chin is almost touching their chest while the stylist cuts the back.  When I was able to look up again I was stunned into silence by the fact that most of the length of my hair in the back was GONE.  I didn't realize that this stylist was either a) hard of hearing b) doesn't know what the eff shoulders are.  It sounds almost ridiculous as I am a grown woman but I felt sick and seriously in shock that my hair was cut so short that I was unable, at that moment, to even say anything as I feared I would lose it.  My hair was all on the floor so at this point there was nothing that could be done to rectify this. To give an idea I went in with hair that was about a half inch below my shoulders and I left with hair so short you cannot tie it back into a pony tail.  Not only was the cut WAY too short, it was too dramatic an angle compared to what I came in with and what I asked to have restored.    Needless to say I would NEVER return and would sooner venture to cut my hair with a butter knife prior to returning to this place again.  My husband also got his hair cut and wasn't entirely happy with his as he felt the stylist didn't really listen to instruction (seems a theme with this place).  I should have taken the lack of reviews as a tip.    Total cost for two haircuts (ladies and male) was $90 - which is usually the cost for one decent haircut anywhere else.  I would much rather pay for a quality stylist who listens to what the customer is asking than save money on what would be the Dollarama version of a haircut.  Avoid..unless you really like surprises involving your hairstyle.~butter ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~6YdRAc4jtDNLyq1sjmE2uw~Plain and simple, we ordered a $15 pizza and it tasted like Ajax and 409. It took 30 minutes to cook, since they "couldn't" deliver. Pretty bad meal.~pizza ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~NT8UDdVcgbmeBpO5KFs_vw~I hate to pile it on to a local restaurant that is struggling, but it is what it is.  Walked in to the pizza side, very hot, was directed to the bar side, waited ~15 minutes for my pizza.  Had the 12" white pizza for lunch, with the advertised lunch specials being unavailable @ 11:40.  Ricotta, mozzarella, whisper of garlic.  Very lackluster, the cheeses seemed old, with the ricotta being especially clumpy and not creamy.  The crust on the outside edge was terrible, with the crazy sensation of toothpaste somehow.  A cavernous bar area that was completely empty from 11:45-12:25.  A very depressed owner matched this soulless mockery of a restaurant.  Pay your respects for 15 years of service... and move on.~pizza pizza white pizza mozzarella, garlic. cheeses ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~ZhoG-ax98b_dIJqIfHZjXw~DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT!!!  This restaurant deserves no stars.  Foolishly and uncharacteristically, I did not check Yelp because my wife said she had been here in the past and it was fine.  She obviously blotted it from her mind as a horribly traumatic experience.  When we walked in, we didn't need to be seated because there was only one other couple in the restaurant, the first bad sign. The second was there was not a server in sight.  After about 5 minutes, a sever did appear from the back somewhere.  She asked for our drink order and I told her we were ready to order our dinners also, My wife ordered lasagne, which was an early bird special.  Bad sign #3.  The waitress asked her if she wanted the lunch or dinner portion (it was 6:30pm).  My wife replied that she wanted the early bird special.  The waitress grabbed the menu to examine it stating that she wasn't familiar with it because she was just here temporarily.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and iced tea.  Bad sign #4.  The waitress brought my iced tea. What could be wrong with iced tea? It was the foulest, most undrinkable concoction I ever attempted to drink.  When the waitress came by, I told her the iced tea was undrinkable & to bring me a Diet Coke. She came back shortly with a glass of regular Coke because they didn't carry Diet.  I said fine.  Shortly thereafter, an older man came out and said he heard that my tea wasn't good so he would bring me a fresh one.  He brought me the (fresh) one.  I didn't think it was possible, but it tasted worse than the first one.  The salads came and they were OK.  They had fresh leaf lettuce, with tomato and onion, but the italian dressing tasted like Wishbone (Thank God they didn't make it themselves).  Now for the entrees.  I won't go into any detail, but suffice it to say, if Taco Bell & Jack in the Box made lasagne and Chicken Cacciatore, I would eat it there before I'd set foot in this restaurant.  By the way, I haven't been to either of those places in the past 20 years.  My wife and I agreed, this was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten in and I'm talking about literally thousands of restaurant meals.  I cannot fathom how this "restaurant" is still in existence.  I have definitely learned my lesson.  I will never ever forget to check Yelp before I go to a new restaurant for fear that I might have blotted this nightmare out of my mind as my wife obviously did.~lasagne, chicken cacciatore tea. tea. tea? tea coke. coke tea salads lettuce, tomato onion, italian dressing taco bell & lasagne chicken cacciatore, ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~8oTgWG7cOWRMkcvQCjzQcA~11 bucks for a large cheese pizza was actually a bit refreshing in a market of overpriced food items these days.  Clearly not the best pizza I've had, but definitely good on the palate and worthwhile.  I'd order again if the moment was right.~cheese pizza pizza ~3
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~4Po-rtwgTL5EYvx3mA3htA~My boyfriend and I went in the other night by accident. We didn't even know it was there. Not many people there at first and we questioned if we were going to stay, but who we thought was the bartender was actually one of the owners. His name was Dax and he was awesome. He had my boyfriend and I laughing and we decided to stay for dinner. We ordered a pizza which was actually really good! More people started coming in and next thing you know Dax started up the karaoke machine and people had a blast. Not only is he a good singer but he's really good at working the entire room. I know he trying to make some changes and updates there and when he does he will have the place jumping. Definitely coming back!!~pizza ~4
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~GwR3Jtf_3wqDlSLmro4Dbg~We stopped by at 6:30p on our way home from a fed x pick up and thought we would try somewhere new.  We should have known when we walked in and not a soul was there but us and the eerie bartender.  We ordered 2 burbon and diet cokes and what arrive was 2 drinks both only half full with partially melted ice.  I would have sworn that they were left overs from someone elses table but there wasn't anyone else there.  They tasted like watered down coke.  The bartender took out order and he had no idea what time happy hour was over and it was on the plastic (nasty dirty) flier on the table. He certainly could have read it cause it looked like he had plenty of time since he had zero customers.  He took our order and had no knowledge of the menu.  I really can't rate the food cause we told the guy to forget it and left.  What was really strange (besides the weird music he started playing) was that he was not surprised at all.  Not in the least.  It was like he never intended to ever have to serve food in the first place.  After we left I read the reviews and noticed that the place has been open since 2007 and never had a good review or even a fair one.  Hmmmm  Something tells me this isn't really a restaurant,  I'm thinking this is a front for something, drugs, money laundering, anything but food. THe whole experience really creeped us out.  Maybe it was the 110 yr old bartender.  Go back??  I won't even drive by it again!  It was just tooo creepy.  Oh and the only reason I gave it 1 star is because you can't give zero!~coke. ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~Xy5HqFJM9h5RlivJPWOt5A~I met up with a friend here for a quick dinner after work and I took it for what it was worth. We grabbed a beer and some half price appetizers from their 4-7 happy hour menu. We were the only table in the place at 7PM, however there were others at the bar.   The food was average. They had really good ranch dressing and a salad that used actual green lettuce (romaine) which I was impressed with, considering. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my friend had the Chicken Parm, we split them. It's super affordable for a sit down dinner and feels good to support local businesses as much as possible.  I would go back if it was convenient - but I wouldn't bring out of town visitors.~appetizers ranch dressing salad lettuce ( romaine) chicken chicken ~3
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~9xhKRFKH8KkfTGo2kyFYGg~So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.  Should have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. "No," she said. "I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye." When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.  Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.  Bad service, bad food. Beware.~spaghetti, ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~PHdMeufBnZQP7WX1T2NR8g~Really can't say much bad about this place. Went with family, had a extra large sausage pizza. First let me start off. I'm a snob, I only put stuff in my mouth that is good as I have a problem with eating bad food. I enjoyed it. The sauce is a bit sweeter then what I'm used to, but good. The crust is crispy, New York style. I ordered the lasagna. Much to my surprise, it was also delicious! Down side, beer snob, and not a huge selection, but seems like a nice place to relax. The older gentleman was super nice and overall a good experience. Kinda shocked at the reviews on here. If you want crappy pizza go to pizza hut. If you want good pizza stop here.~sausage pizza lasagna. pizza pizza pizza ~5
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~zaRB3l684TEJEyBdIsQzbQ~This isn't a great place.  It's not bad, but it's so far from great that it leans in the not so good direction.  It looked great from the parking lot so I figured I'd give it a try.  Walking in the door at 12:05pm on a weekday, I expected to be one of several folks rushing in for their lunch hour.  Just one other table in the whole place.  Should have tipped me off.  The place is good sized, has a nice bar and a pool table in the back.  2 tv's were showing different sports channels above the bar.  I couldn't help but feel like this was more of a bar that served Italian food than an Italian restaurant w/ a bar.  My service was fine.  The girl serving me was pleasant, but not exactly interested in being there.  The food was nothing above ok.  The sauce was fine, a bit sweet, but ok.  The pasta hadn't seen al dente in so long it would have needed a map to get back there.  And the garlic bread on the side was so dry it felt like they used stale bread before toasting it.  This was their special of the day.  Don't you want your special to be the things you do well?    If you're interested in their Texas Hold 'em tournements, I bet this could be a good time as a locaction.  The bar is really good sized and it's in a good spot in town.    Just make sure you've eaten dinner before you go.  PS - And don't use the bathroom unless you really really have to.  Kid you not - the toilet bowl cover was duct taped together.~pasta garlic ~2
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~egRTvRvHKEyS8DH73Z89nw~This was the worst pizza I have had in the ten years I have been in Phoenix. The crust was flaky, like when you freeze bread forever and finally eat it. Cheese and sauce were some odd orange color with a awful taste. I threw this pizza out the next day. First time I have ever committed such a shameful act. It was 730 on a Saturday night when I picked up my pizza  and there were only two other cars in the lot...now I know why.~pizza cheese pizza pizza ~1
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~-PK42yTwq3M4mxb01qY93g~we ordered a white pizza to go.  what we got was a regular marinara/cheese pizza. (of course I didn't discover this until we were already home) the pizza was just ok, far from amazing. there was a cat roaming the bar while we waited... I adore cats, but not in restaurants.  overall, the place just seemed dark and greasy.  we won't be returning.~white pizza pizza pizza ~2
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~hkc8pHMbDHbFUPDxQYwuCA~Good neighborhood restaurants are hard to find, a place that you can call your own, where the food is good and reasonably priced.  And in the southwest it's even harder to find a good neighborhood restaurant that serves Italian food.  In today's world of fast food and chain restaurants, people tend to choose the Olive Garden over a small business when the craving for good pasta and/or pizza dishes.  Carmen's Bistro on Baseline in Tempe lets one go back for a nice Italian meal without the hassle of corporate America's set menu.  A small place that mixes neighborhood bar with neighborhood restaurant, Carmen's is perfect for a night with friends or even a quiet setting to bring a date for the first time.  As you walk up, the kitchen if fully exposed so that one can watch the cooks prepare tasty delights that come out of the kitchen.  Upon arriving with a group of friends from out of town for an early afternoon dinner, we took a seat in the corner of the dimly lit restaurant.  The menu is traditional American Italian cuisine, serving everything from anti pasta to spaghetti with marinara to pizza.  Everyone in the group had the same thought as we looked at the menu, and a round or calzones was ordered by all, with two people getting fried zucchini sticks and a salad to start.  Arrival of the first course was quick, though the person that ordered the fried zucchini was surprised to see that the zucchini he ordered magically turned into fried mozzarella sticks.  Instead of sending it back, he ate them with much delight.  A small mistake turned into a lovely appetizer that was served with marina sauce for dipping.  The salad that came out was simple, your basic garden salad, that was portioned for a quick bite before the main course, not to filling.  The calzones then came out a little later.  Wait time was about twenty minutes, acceptable considering that they are made fresh in the kitchen.  The crust on the calzone was very basic, and not seasoned all that much.  A little garlic power would've gone a long way.  The same marinara sauce that was served with the mozzarella sticks came with it, for the same dipping purposes.  The sauce it self was a little sweet to taste, and served cold.  Heat would've made it a little more enjoyable, and of course a little garlic might take away the extra sweetness that was brought on by the tomato.  The filling in the calzone was hot, but not too hot to where one might burn their mouth.  The mixture that was in the calzone was your basic pizza toppings and could've been seasoned with Italian herbs for extra flavor, a little disappointing to say the least.  A very filling meal for everyone in the group, though not as satisfying for one's taste buds.  Service was not bad, but the screw up with the appetizer might be more a reflection of a lack of attention to detail by our server and not the cook.  Carmen's Bistro has a nice foundation in place, but still has some work to do if it wants to be considered a fine Italian food at a decent rate.  Still, it was better than the corporate menu and over trained service at the Olive Garden, making it a nice place to walk up to and eat, but not a place to set your plans to for an evening.~olive pasta pizza date pasta spaghetti pizza zucchini salad zucchini zucchini mozzarella sticks. salad garden salad ~3
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~PEKFy2Nj5bYlZpI2u4UIBA~This place is a ton of fun, particularly when karaoke is being done.  The first time I came to Carmen's I didn't know it was karaoke until I heard the singing, and I was hesitant about eating with that going on.  I had always thought that people who did karaoke at bars and restaurants sucked really bad.  At Carmen's at least, the singers were really good!  I actually enjoyed listening to them, which I really didn't expect.  Tonight we were actually disappointed that the karaoke didn't start until after we were done.    The food here is so good.  They have huge calzones, delicious pasta and surprisingly delicious salads.  Yum.  The portions are so big that I have yet to try the desserts, but I have high hopes.  The service has also been really superb.  Really friendly people who do their best.  The atmosphere is dimly lit and bar-like, with nice comfy booths.~pasta salads. desserts, ~4
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~kVAQ-09PTVzB2urx4rjKjw~Arrived at 10pm, ordered a $7 personal pan pizza with tomatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli -- it was fresh out of the oven, w/ a slight amount of cheese and slight amount of sauce. (Be sure to ask to personalize it, if need more of either); plus a merlot, $4.50. Waiter was either on speed or had not had his downers yet ;)  My buddy had arrived earlier to get songs out of her head...and into the ether. So I joined her for a few, my first karaoke experience :) The sound system was pretty crappy and the song selection was very country, somewhat 90's rock, and a few from several genres otherwise.  Crowd was a small group of friends (10), a small group of college students (4), and pairs of drinkers at the bar (3 pairs, come and go). Dimly lit, comfy booths, ordinary tables/chairs, pool table for $ (did not try), and clean bathrooms.  Reminds me of places I've visited in small highway towns when driving cross country road trip'n.~pizza mushrooms, broccoli -- cheese ~3
8VwDchHdgV7xJFGAjay2jw~YVUPoOJOrKcD6UuMjtVPUg~I'm sorry Carmen's but you are getting a one star review.   I should have known as soon as I walked in this was not the sort of place to eat at. Should have just bellied up to the bar instead of ordering food, but we were starving. The eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried. There we were pools of grease on the plate that they tried to mask by covering it with sauce and cheese (nice try) but you still could taste the overused deep fried oil remnants.  The drinks were weak. Very weak.  The canoli had the same deep fried stale taste and it was filled with cream that resembled the consistency of toothpaste.  The meal was one of the worst I have had in ages. Hands down, I will not be returning.~cheese ( ~1
HTMAsmD9WIJKGZVX-Uw8_A~dk7ljUs21G0mG0OxRJz9zQ~Yelp removed my previous comment because (someone requested it) yelp said there was not enough information was provided in my review so it violated their policy so I wanted to rewrite with everything that happened. On September 25th we placed an order with Matt for pans for the steam oven we purchased through Voss. Around 12/8 I contacted Matt about  the pans inquiring when we would get them they sent us an invoice and had us pay $25 extra for shipping which the pans were already overpriced. 12/17 we were sent the incorrect racks and informed Matt immediately. On 1/7 I emailed Matt to ask when they would get the correct trays so we could switch the incorrect for the correct trays he said he would have them tomorrow and wanted to set up a day the owner (Rick) who frequents the area could pick them up. 1/11 Matt asked if Wednesday 1/13 worked I said yes between 11am-8pm he said okay. Around 8pm Rick called and said he was late and asked if we could reschedule and i said okay. He never contacted us to reschedule. 1/18 I emailed Matt requesting a full refund and they could pick up the incorrect pans when it was convenient for them. 2/2 Matt apologized and asked for our credit card information which I replied no to because we paid by check. 2/6 we sent a very upset email because it still had not been resolved which Matt replied that Rick (the owner) would bring us a check and pick up the pans on Monday. 2/8 Matt asked what number to give Rick to call when he was here which he already had from previous call to reschedule the initial pick up but I gave it to him anyways Rick never showed up! 2/10 I emailed Matt and asked him to mail me a check for the full amount and he said the secretary would mail the next day but then she called out sick which he notified me of which was fine. 2/16 was the set pick up date by FedEx for the pans but I initially told Matt I needed the check first which he said I should receive Monday or Tuesday prior to pick up. The check never came so we did not send the pans. After that we left a message with the secretary told her everything that has happened and that we needed to speak to Rick. It was late so he called the next day left a voice mail and said he would be there until 4pm. We called around 3:30 asked for Rick and the secretary said he was not in but once we gave her the name to leave a message he was magically still there. He told us we were sent a check and it must have got lost in the mail. He told us he would be there tonight to get the pans and give us a check. Which does not fix all the trouble we have gone through to sum it up after telling him from a business owners standpoint letting the customer keep the incorrect pans and giving them their check back should have been the solution that is what Rick agreed to do. Also we ordered the pans from the manufacturer saved $100 and received free 2 day shipping.~date ~2
Gph5gj66pQL3dnksdV6zGA~TOsuNFsycOPo3fBmeoq-Gw~I probably get my hair cut like once a year because every time it's been disastrous but my visit here was very satisfactory!! All I wanted was long layers and angles and my stylist did just that. Was a bit nervous at first since it is a beauty school, but my hair turned out great! Shampoo, cut, and blowdry was only $7.50! Hell, I can't even get a burrito for that price.~burrito ~4
4Jm2ZPMdvoyJMMPLZpq50w~aa3c9BAORWAm9eXuxduObg~Antiques Mall of Madison is a labyrinthian collection of vendor stalls housed under one roof. If you need something old, you can probably find it here. I strolled through at a leisurely pace and discovered everything from mountains of costume jewelry to nifty old cameras to walls and walls of (surely possessed) dolls.   My favorite find was probably the shelf of Fire King Peach Lustre glassware - I think I'll have to go back and treat myself to a bowl or two now that I know it's safe to eat from [I tried doing some research at the mall, but my phone was having trouble getting service in the huge hall]. The pearlescent sheen and orange-y peach hue are just too good to pass up.   Next time there's a rainy day or you've got a lull in your Sunday afternoon, embrace your inner septuagenarian and see what floats your boat from the good old days.~peach peach ~4
3FkwIqBgu7dCv9pFQRTBDg~nLKVu4cExUw2ctL_7d7uWg~Chicago guy here reviewing a Chicago style hotdog joint in Arizona.  You have to ask for "Chicago Style Hotdogs"  Ordered: Combo extra hot dipped 2 dogs everything extra sport Fries and Coke = Beef was good peppery and thin, a little dry for a beef that was "dipped", so i think they dipped the bread but not the whole sandwich, next time I will ask for xtra juice.   Giardineria was really good, crunchy and spicy. Sausage was fantastic, reminded me of Caputo's hot italian, the sausage was split which i wasn't a fan of but all in all the combo is really good and would order again and again  = Dogs, good, maybe too much celery salt but now i'm being a  Hotdog Snob.  I don't know if they steam the buns, because my first was definitely a, found at the back of the pantry hard as rock edges type bun and killed the effect, but that's why u order two and the other one was perfect.  Note to establishment, steam those buns.            Al's helped to put me at ease knowing that there is a place in the Valley that I can go to and not have to miss Chicago food or order form Portillo's online.  I want to try Pizza Puff and Gyro next time.  Good place will make it a must stop.~sport fries coke beef beef sandwich, sausage sausage celery pizza ~4
3FkwIqBgu7dCv9pFQRTBDg~VOaUA_BawM4tTnaZc_gslA~Fair food, fair price, very nice folks!  I took the kids here after a day at the Falcon Field Air Museum, they were hot, tired and hungry. After explaining (a few billion times) that this was not "fast food" and the burger wouldnt fly into their mouths as we sped through a drive through, they settled down.  Have I mentioned that my grandkids havent been taught much in the ways of "someplace different"?   I'm working on that. The space is nice, with a mixture of booths, tables and a counter in the front window.  The counter where you order overlooks a clean and shiny grill, with assorted pictures of the offerings for those that have trouble reading the menu board.  With that setup.. heres the rundown. I wanted to try a Chicago style dog, my grandson wanted a hamburger, and the granddaughter wanted a corn dog. The hamburger was a fine if unremarkable version. Which was perfect, decent 1/4 Lb patty & Bun, melted american cheese, nice and tasty. The corn dog was about the same as you would find anywhere, also good (especially for a 3 year old who doesnt like culinary suprises!)  My jumbo hot dog was good, the actual weiner and bun itself was extremely unremarkable, in fact, and I'm sorry to say, I rather prefer the hot dogs at Costco (not the buns though!) it tasted like a cheap beef weiner in a wonder bread roll. The difference was the toppings, and thats what a Chicago hot dog is all about!  It had a small amount of tomato, pickle, peppers and mustard on it.  And I loved the fresh taste they gave it. Much crisper than heavy chili or cheese! My only desire would have been for it to have a heavier helping of the toppings, and in fact when I go back (which I will!) I'm going to request a foolish amount of toppings, I recomend anyone trying it for the first time, just dive right in and join me in ordering extra toppings, after all, thats the point of this style of dog! I ordered a chicago-style tamale because I had no idea such things existed. What I got was a microwave meat tamale that was indeed made in Chicago. It was just a sad, sad beast. I'm sure it's a famous Chicago food, and beloved, and if I was raised there I would crave it, but to me, it was flavorless, soggy in the wrong way, and existed only so that people could drench it in chili and cheese, probably a hit at 7-11's, but not for me. However, at about $1, I was willing to try it, and glad I did, however I shall not be having that one again.   We ordered 3 fries, and two would have done! They load those baskets up!  I would ask for them well done next time, just because I like a slightly crispier fry, but that a minor quibble, zero complains on the fries! Or anything, $15 for a mess of food, cooked to order, by a locally owned shop that cares. I'll certainly go back.  They also sell Gyro's, which I didn't try, even though I've been longing for a great gyro, and Italian sausage and steak sandwiches. I want to try those next.~burger hamburger, corn dog. hamburger patty & american cheese ~4

Been going here for a few years, but haven't tried much of the menu - the Chicago dogs and fries are just too good. Also recommend the beef sandwich, which comes juicy, tangy, and messy. And let me tell you, some of the best things in life are messy.~fries beef sandwich, ~4
3FkwIqBgu7dCv9pFQRTBDg~IJXQlaOX-jmgMRIZjbRfIA~Probably the best Chicago style food and by far the best Chicago Dogs I've had in Arizona...  Nuff said!  Menu is very fairly priced and make sure to get the Vienna beef Chicago dogs... ugh sooo good.  table/booth seating and a few bar type seats up front along the window.   Al is usually manning the front and/or register so be sure to say hi...  Very friendly staff and plenty of Chicago swag around the walls to check out.  Definitely check out Al's... very good food!~beef ~5
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~bPygyBkHDKxPzwi9-He3IA~I'm going to go right out and say it.  Tim Horton's is 1000000X better than Dunkin' Donuts.  Do what you will with that tidbit, but it's the truth.   This specific Tim Horton's was the best.  First of all, it's open 24/7.  And since Joe and I did not get to the hotel until 1:00 AM this was a godsend!!! Never mind I was eating the worst thing ever but it was damn tasty and it definitely hit the spot, especially with the hell we went through.  For some reason Tim Horton's (at least in Toronto) does NOT have iced coffee.  ::Brakes slamming:: What?! I don't understand it.  And what I didn't understand even more was that most of the Torontonians that I saw were all drinking HOT COFFEE (ok, I know this is Toronto, but we managed to go during a terrible heat wave, so it boggled my mind even more).  They have these iced Cappachino things, that are basically like DD's Coffee Coolatas, and I really wasn't a fan of them (they were however, cheaper that DD's version).  Probably won't be getting those again.    Now if only they went with iced coffee, they might get that last star....~coffee. coffee ( coffee coffee, ~4
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~S86n4QmE6kuWlrGNa6DBRg~Meh. These things are all over the place, and people in Toronto seem to love them, so I went in to try. Basically it's a cross between Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds. Greasy tables and mediocre eats. Not impressed. You're probably better suited getting your coffee from another chain.~coffee ~2
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~1vZmV4mzJoO77V8VUnVUpQ~Walking on the street I saw  a line of people at this place in the morning. I go "WTF" and decide to check it out. Turns out to be like a dunkin donuts. Food was pretty good and the coffee woke me up~coffee ~4
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~3cYQjEg8moe11bRX9Jy-TA~They ran out of pretty much everything besides some donuts and plain coffee. This was our first Tim Hortons experience and left a bad impression on us.~coffee. ~1
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~TCajQpBygBjDgDPLi9dMsg~Great coffee and the best blueberry muffins.~coffee ~3
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~XXpdXAYDNz8ysneSQ4NwQA~You already tried Tim Horton's and you either like it or you don't. But just because I've heard quite a few comments about the quality of the donut or whatever, I thought I'd share my googling on the subject (maybe this is all common knowledge but maybe you haven't read this yet). As of 2002, the chain moved from having the stores ditch all in-store baking equipment in favour of microwaves. The donuts are partially baked in a plant in Brantford and shipped frozen to be microwaved on site throughout the day. So if you used to like Tim Horton's donuts and can't figure out why you don't like them so much any more that is why.  Also the "homemade" chicken noodle soup that they serve at lunch is definitely powdered and rehydrated. One bite of the shrivelled peas and carrots in the soup and it is obvious. But in Toronto, there really aren't that many alternative options for donuts and the product, if nothing else, is consistent so if you are okay with it then you are okay with it.~chicken soup peas soup ~2
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~z3hjTX9rQR9O4ZQqwSsWlg~I heard someone mention that Tim Horton's serves coffee... if you want to call that coffee that is. If this is indeed a "national treasure" then this is one poor nation. I don't understand how anybody could be drinking this mixture of diluted tasteless coffee, half a cup of milk, and a load of sugar. That's not coffee - that's dirt. Speaking of Ice Capp and the timbits.... hmm, I think the most appropriate comparison is a cup of sugar and sugar balls. If you have never been to Tim Horton's (you probably aren't Canadian), do yourself a favor and go to Starbuck's or Second Cup. I do have to give them one thing - their sandwiches are pretty good, especially the bacon turkey one. Just order it with a coke or tea.~coffee... coffee coffee, milk, coffee - sandwiches bacon coke tea. ~3
GYNYjwzyDPN3NqbL7_9tow~B2bTzWju2IBbzvaOhcJp-g~The service they gave its fast but not polite. Just fast: like saying BUY, BUY, BUY. They gave me a coffe and thats it. They did not provide me sugar, milk, anythign else. Not even TKS.~milk, ~1
0em7keGjiaWuWYelDbhjHg~sfng2FAOAWDmtyF2J08rgA~We went for breakfast coffee & treats while visiting Montreal; I think it was their opening week. Everything was delicious and the almond croissant to die for! The owner lady (I think she's the owner) is so incredibly sweet, she let me take pictures, and even made the pastry chefs put out more pastries for the photo, so sweet & welcoming! The place is also very cozy! (actually my profile pic was taken there!) bonne chance!~coffee & almond pastries ~5
0em7keGjiaWuWYelDbhjHg~cm3PQIeDbtf9bJMV7p4zCg~Who'd have thought that one day in the Point,there'd be such a place? I was in the laundromat next door, this past summer, and the delicious aroma wafting from this place certainly did NOT have me focusing on my laundry!  I decided to take a quick peek  and ask the proprietor what she was cooking, and she graciously  told me it was chorizo quiche;unfortunately, I don't eat pork. No matter; there are delicious other quiches,as well as yummy soups, sandwiches,croissants, and a small gourmet grocery section as well.She even has the famous Arhoma boulangerie deliver their bread to her establishment, so now all one has to do is place his/her order with her and the bread will be reserved. ( specialty breads in particular).Sundays are brunch days. Great to finally have a place like this in the neighbourhood.~chorizo pork. sandwiches, breads ~5
0em7keGjiaWuWYelDbhjHg~zYzMY0ps3VAOY6m32H7caQ~I got off the bus on a Tuesday to eat at this restaurant for lunch. Clean and funky decor. I had their pulled ham grilled cheese which was really yummy. It came with a beat & chorizo soup which was a little on the spicy side. It also came with a small leaf salad which tasted awfully salty. After 2 bites, I decided not to finish and told the waitress it was too salty. When at the cash to pay a woman from the kitchen said "I heard your salad was too salty. Not to make excuses but sometimes the salt sticks together in the salad. You should have told us it was too salty, I would have replaced it" (so it's my fault?). I told her it was very salty and I still had an awful salty taste in my mouth. She then decided to give me a chocolate-almond croissant to go and said "well here's a dessert for you, careful, it is very sweat" (which was quite catty thing to say on her part I thought). I do not believe I will ever return to eat there.~cheese chorizo soup salad salad salad. almond ~2

0em7keGjiaWuWYelDbhjHg~bRIJKOKlQB_zLu0TJ3K_3A~A great place with ready to go meals that are all fresh and prepared with local produces.  This place is a great addition to the neighborhood with great healthy tasty food. Traditional Quebec fare and other great meals to go are cooked fresh daily. They also carry bread from a neighborhood bakery that are quite good. They carry quiche, bread, sandwiches, croissant... and recently we tried a great "Pâté de foie aux figues" that was sublime.  A place to visit for sure!~sandwiches, ~4
0em7keGjiaWuWYelDbhjHg~uEzUJbRo9ucmwqqilhYHSA~I really liked the place! Nice spaghetti sauce for take-out, and they have an interesting selection of wine from a private importer. I'll go back for lunchs, or for a quick grab of food for supper, for sure!~spaghetti ~5
F0SrIVmgWARlSDr1943YIw~2_NmhIJOkYy2KJLiyNbspw~Aufgrund eines überschwänglichen Presseartikels wollten wir mit 3 Personen heute das Accanto ausprobieren  und wurden bitterst enttäuscht. Letztendlich soll es wohl so eine Art italienischer Schicki  Micki  Treff sein, ein Restaurant ist es jedoch ganz sicher nicht. Oben keine Sitzplätze, nur Stehtische, unten keine vernünftigen Tische und auch keine vernünftigen Stühle, sondern unpraktischer und ungemütlicher Designerkram. Von einer Speisekarte kann man wirklich nicht sprechen, denn es gibt als Hauptgericht lediglich 3 Sorten Pasta (darunter 1 Sorte Spagetti), 1 Sorte Risotto, 1 Sorte Gnocchi und eine Art Flammkuchen, das war's dann wirklich auch schon, mehr gibt es tatsächlich nicht ! Restaurant geht schon ein weinig anders ! Dennoch hatte ich die Spagetti bestellt und obwohl es nur genau EINE Sorte Spagetti gab, hat der vollkommen überforderte Kellner 3 x nachgefragt, welche Spagetti ich eigentlich wolle. Auf neine Nachfrage, ob es noch andere Spagetti  Sorten gäbe, gab er keine Antwort. Dazu habe ich als Getränk ein kleines Wasser bestellt, was mit eigenartigen Blicken und wieder mehrfachem Nachfragen des Kellners , ob ich wirklich ein Kleines Wasser wolle kommentiert wurde, offenbar sollen dort die im Gegensatz zum Essen in Massen angebotenen Weine vorrangig an den Mann gebracht werden! Nach 10 Minuten war weder ein Getränk, noch eine ebenfalls bestellte Tomatensuppe noch irgendeines der 3 bestellten Pastagerichte da, anstelle dessen wurden 3 weitere fremde Personen an unseren Tisch gesetzt. Als die dann auch etwas bestellen wollten kam die Mitteilung, dass es 30 bis 45 Minuten dauern würde, wenn man essen wolle  WIE BITTE ? Für gerade einmal 5 einfache Pasta/Risotto  Angebote die es auf der Speisekarte gibt auch noch 45 Minuten warten ? Wir haben unsere Bestellung storniert und sind tief enttäuscht gegangen. Resümee: Wahrscheinlich gut zum Weintrinken, für alles andere jedoch vollkommen ungeeignet.~pasta ( risotto, gnocchi ~1

0IySwcfqwJjpHPsYwjpAkg~6G7p9aAtPHHN3fA24vKyaw~I went to this Subway for lunch the other day and realized when I got to the register that I didn't have my debit card in my wallet! I didn't have any cash on me and the cashier was SO nice and understanding and let me take my sandwich and told me to come back and pay the next day.  When I came back we had a good laugh about the whole situation.  Top notch customer service right there!   They are always friendly and accurate and keep the line moving during the lunch rush.~sandwich ~5
0IySwcfqwJjpHPsYwjpAkg~I-pfXc15hlhIP6p-JxS1PA~Whoa. The lunch rush here is no joke!   I literally walked in to twelve people in front of me...so be  prepared to wait, but have no worries; they operate with military precision. The line moves quickly, there is no confusion or yelling and the staff does an excellent job with their customer service.   Right off the bat, I was pleased to see more than four people behind the counter go accommodate the lunch rush. And to see that each was given a specific task. There was an order taker, a meat and cheese expert, a veggies topper and a cashier. Then there was even a runner filling up the (veggie and bread) stations and getting whatever anyone needed. Clearly, I made up all these titles but you get the idea. Everyone knew their role and it worked out so well for everyone (staff and customers)....especially during a busy lunch rush.   I opted for their new $4, $5 or $6 lunch special where you get a 6 inch sub (tons of options) and drink. My sandwich was prepared correctly, plenty of fresh veggies just like I like and everyone was super nice, they made sure I had everything I needed before I left...including my cookies. Now, they didn't have the raspberry cheesecake, but substituting chocolate chip was just as good.   I will definitely return to this Subway. Since it's such a fast, friendly and a healthy option.~cheese sandwich cookies. ~4
0IySwcfqwJjpHPsYwjpAkg~ffBu3NL-yI4iJOU0Ec1FTA~I come to this store when I'm looking for something moderately healthy for lunch... lol  I mean, if you don't count the sodium of prepared meats, but whatever... You know what I'm saying...  The prep area is always clean, the staff remembers me even if it's been a while since I've been in and as I posted in my Yorkmont BP review, you can forgo the expensive chips and drink to make it a combo and go right into the gas station next door... That might be my favorite part... lol My order is always correct and they don't douse the sandwich with too much oil and vinegar, either... Great job with condiment application...  I like this store, but I only head to this location sometimes since it's not always on the way to anywhere I'm headed, if I'm out and about...~chips sandwich ~4
0IySwcfqwJjpHPsYwjpAkg~mgcojM9tkwjBruDzPdikSQ~All Subways are the same, right? Incorrect. Factors like customer service, cleanliness, and FRESHNESS make all the difference with this Subway!  Lastly, let's not forget spinach. I will not eat at a Subway if I'm stuck with iceberg lettuce!~spinach. iceberg lettuce! ~4
AI7OupGT468boUjdGHfecg~vz3Px3ZvXJdNM6RJQ3mAhg~Grenadier Pond borders High Park to the east, and the village of Swansea to the west. There are a variety of activities you can participate it throughout the year, depending on the season.  It's a great spot any time of year for taking photographs. You'll find swans building nest in the spring time, and kids skating on the ice in the winter. And speaking of, you'll find a make-shift hockey surf cleared away on the frozen ice in the winter and usually skating paths all around the pond. In the summer, you'll see people fishing all over the place.  Along the Queensway, you'll find a few benches that sit at the edge of the pond, which are great for relaxing as you take in the scenery. You can continue into High Park, and walk along the edge of the pond all the way up. During winter months, or very early mornings, you won't find many people around, and it can really feel like you're away hiking.  During the warmer months, the area around the pond can get quite busy, starting with the cherry blossom trees blooming in the spring. This of course brings a ton of garbage, although people tend to be more respectful than they are when they're downtown (when it comes to throwing away their trash properly).  Grenadier Pond is one of the best reasons to live in Swansea.~cherry ~4
2ByeG6MPXp1OfhJt-f6-iw~4O-ad0u-w_TFT5xJK6MPIA~I was surprised ! The food is very tasty. We tool a combination plate (beef , shrimp, rice, salad and spring roll) to be honest i liked everything. I cannot comment alit on service, the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived  but was full before we left, the waitress was always smiling and very helpful, food came fast and vey well presented.  (Not the top in his style of food but definitely not like those all you can eat buffet or fast food Chinese). I  don't know how diverse is their regular menu , buy from my experience i would definitely recommend it.~beef , shrimp, salad ~4
7u8PwKlfk7rKIPfe7nRt7A~uZh5HMLOvm6AAZw5O4BvMA~If you haven't tried Rosati's you are missing out! When I came here I had a meatball sub and it was the best I've had thus far. The meatballs were so tender and the bread was perfect, not too crisp or too soft to leave you with a soggy mess!  I finally brought my boyfriend here and he loved it! Call in your order ahead of time so it will be ready by the time you come or you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes. There are only counters inside and if you can bear the heat by now there are tables outside. It's not a sit down and eat place. If you're looking for authentic Italian give Rosati's a try!~meatballs ~4
7u8PwKlfk7rKIPfe7nRt7A~082Twhz7hPyWDzny5UG9Hg~The GOODYEAR Rosati's has always been very good to us!  I think their menu has changed over the past 6 years or so, but the pizza remains outstanding!  We normally went for the thin crust combo - very basic, very excellent crust!  The toppings are so good that it doesn't need a ton of crust to make up for it.  I have yet to try their deep dish or Chicago style pie but it's on the list of "to try" items.  I'm working in the middle of Phoenix right now, so I'll be trying the location close to the airport.  But when we lived in Goodyear, Rosati's was as good as it gets!  Memorable enough that I always get a pizza from here when I get the chance to stop by Goodyear for old times' sake!  **UPDATE** I have since had their deep dish Chicago pie twice and it is unbelievable - count yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have access to this type of pizza in your area - it's a rare treat!~pizza pie pizza pie pizza ~5
7u8PwKlfk7rKIPfe7nRt7A~RjaR8T0dkNvZDMVYaT6CiQ~This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food).~pizza pizza ~2
7u8PwKlfk7rKIPfe7nRt7A~N2TgrMuUyok-1SGFSs23lg~I have some friends that live in the Phoenix area that I visit every year.  They brought this for take out and personally, I think it's the best pizza.  I realize everyone has their own tastes but for me this does it.  Great taste.  Thick pieces.  Fantastic.~pizza ~5
7u8PwKlfk7rKIPfe7nRt7A~wl91c_MOhCE_h9U9G2qwYA~Too bad Rosatti's has jacked up their prices... I just cancelled the order to go with NYPD as even before coupon they are a much better value and NYPD is a superior pizza!~pizza ~2
AXWWSxeM8v24-RKA62xG7Q~KE-3K7fjI5GgLR5aeH1YHA~I spoke to Shannon on Feb 28th to schedule a session for my -then- 8 month old son.  I told her I was unavailable March18th- 26th (which happened to be the coldest/rainiest days) and I wanted photos before he turned 9 months. We talked about doing both indoor and outdoor as I wanted to show off his baby rolls and also see him dressed outdoors.  He's never had prof photos dones so I wanted a full range. She said her schedule was "wide open and we shouId wait for a weather appropriate day in the next couple weeks" (her exact words). That is, early March.  I emailed her on Mar 2nd to coordinate. I watched the weather everyday and appropriate days passed. I figured she'd email me!?  On Mar 13th she surprises me to say she was in FL until the 26th and was available late March. Though later she admitted being in Charlotte on the 15th?!  That's a big chunk of unavailable time she never mentioned!!!!  On March 15th we scheduled a session for Wed the 27th (baby's 9 month b-day). I was leery as her replies were delayed and I didn't hear from her to confirm our appointment.  Mar 13th her email begins "I apologize for my delayed response" to my Mar 2nd email Mar 19th her email begins "Hi Tricia! Sorry for my delay...in FL!" to my Mar 13th email.  The morning of the appt. I receive an email saying her husband was called unexpectedly out of town for business and her baby sitter fell through.  Not much notice... especially since I prepared on my side. New date Sat the 30th.  Then my son caught a cold and I sent the following email Fri the 29th:  "I wish we had done the photo session during the first couple weeks of March (before my Dad arrived) like we initially discussed over the phone.  I had no idea you were going out of town during that time. Now, baby boy has a cold and his nose is running.  Not an attractive look for professional photos. Perhaps, it will clear up by tomorrow morning - I will let you you.  I have needed to get his photos done and it's been put off for too long now. - Tricia"  At least I showed some respect for her time.  Her fastest reply ever.... "You seem quite unhappy at this point and I feel you would be more comfortable if you hired another photographer."  I asked her to reconsider (against my better judgment) - after waiting all this time I dreaded having to start all over!  Didn't hear back so I want to forewarn potential clients.  A true professional would have said, "Don't worry! We'll get it done ASAP and it will be fabulous!"  Shannon told me "I do photography for the love of it, not the money so when I come across a client who isn't happy even before the session...we part ways."   If this is only a hobby, she shouldn't call it a business and stick to photographing family and friends.  I was misled. She doesn't want or care about the work.  I waited a month for nothing. And that's like a year in infant time.~date ~1
5gndRta9bccG0I8gKJecbA~zAGHcLkZ06umcqrefyWNZw~Rachel is my stylist and I'll never go to anyone else. She always takes the time to listen to my ideas and concerns - I never feel rushed. There is always nice conversation and never any awkward silence. I always feel relaxed when I'm here. When you walk in, they greet you and take your coat. You are also offered a drink (water, coffee, tea). They genuinely seek to please their clients and those small touches don't go unnoticed.   One of my favorite touches is the complementary hand massage with any color service. You also get a head/neck/shoulder massage after your shampoo. This salon-spa cares about each and every one of their clients and it shows. The girls are all so friendly yet professional. I am definitely a lifelong client.~coffee, tea) ~5
7g-r_uS61rNomPlOKSUkAA~yVTMtd8W9vog-mYdRLLb-A~Ah, the Roo. I've recently found myself here more frequently on Saturday nights. Pretty diverse crowd for McKeesport/White Oak. The people watching is worth the trip!! Bartenders are always nice, and always ready to refill or help you with the menu.  Personally, I'm into wings right now. Theirs are always crispy and the sauces are spot on. They have a Buffalo Chicken dip they serve with soft pita, and it's really good. I could just eat the pita that they coat in parmesan, it's that good!!  They frequently have live entertainment, bands and DJ's. Recently, they added a VIP area that you can get into for an additional cover charge.~chicken pita, pita ~4
7g-r_uS61rNomPlOKSUkAA~RexHna427_zaLKsuoCYctA~So I have been coming here since I started my job near by. This is definitely a local bar where townees do come in and get their drinks and food. I have never felt out of place. The bartenders tend to their customers very well. The location of the bar is not in the best of parts. Their road is full of pot holes so please be careful of those.   The Food is great. I love their fries and their Roo Chicken sandwich. They have a great menu and great wings. Each day they have a special on their food and drinks. I really like this bar because every Thursday they have a DJ present and great dirnk specials. i would come to this bar if you just want to get out the house for a  little bit. By all means, do not dress up to this bar. This is come in your jeans and a shirt and you will be fine. I have brought a few of my friends here and they do like it. It is not the FIRST choice on the list, but if we want to go drink and have good food and not have to worry about spending a lot of money... We know we can go there.~fries chicken sandwich ~4
1xDlhlkQUWUMJ5IddcB0oQ~wm_5-SnKxRJsrhjYPQEvSw~Teri W. was right on the money when she started her review with a big SIGH.  I kinda feel that way too, but I have to give the Country Fresh Farmers Market three stars because many of the products really are very high-quality.  I have bought some interesting things here, including a homemade piggy bank.  I have no use at all for a homemade piggy bank, but it was so cute.  The produce IS horrendously overpriced, but it's usually very fresh and juicy so I get sucked in anyway.  The corn was the worst of it last week... 75 cents an ear is highway robbery.  I never end up spending as much as I plan because I get a little ticked off that the prices don't match what I expect from a farmers market.  I know it's getting to be a useless soapbox at this point, but anywhere else in the country, the prices would be a lot more fair.  I guess i just can't get used to the mark-up here.  Maybe I should lower my expectations a bit.  I'm glad this farmers market is here.  It could be better with more vendors and more reasonable prices.  Three stars for effort, location, quality of produce, and the fact that they will give you a discount if you come later in the day.~corn ~3
1xDlhlkQUWUMJ5IddcB0oQ~hGg-PGSBprP31gJs87r-BA~SIGH.  It has so much potential, but just doesn't live up to my expectations.  There is plenty of space, but there doesn't usually end up with enough vendors.  I love supporting local artists/farmers/etc, but a lot of the produce and stuff is REALLY overpriced.  The day that I went there were 2 produce stands, and one of them was selling stalks of corn for $.75 EACH.  Are you kidding me?  I went to college in Iowa and you could buy locally grown, fresh corn 10 for $1.00!!!  As I said, I love supporting local businesses, but that is a bit outrageous.  The other produce stand had better prices, and I ended up buying a dozen eggs and some plucots (plum/apricot mix??).  I also bought some locally grown honey, which is really good.  I really wish more local business/farmers would get on board with this farmer's market, as I think it's a great location and could be really fantastic.~corn corn honey, ~2
1xDlhlkQUWUMJ5IddcB0oQ~YjgZbFyyAMgpeLdoTBtMHg~Every Thursday, the Henderson Events Plaza on Water Street plays host to this market.  I wouldn't say that there are many farmers present, though.  Since I work right across the street, my co-workers and I usually walk over on a break to buy some goodies.  There is one fruit/vegetable stand that represents the farmer and there is always an array of beautiful produce available, as well as free samples.  The strawberries are huge these days and you can get a complimentary taste.   Other stands offer raw honey, artisan breads, hummus and salsas, and bakery items.  There are also quite a few craft vendors selling home decor like wooden piggy banks, vintage wall posters, salt/pepper shaker sets, soaps, etc.  And, it wouldn't be a farmers market in the Vegas Valley without the hot dog guy, the kettle korn guy, or the guy who sells something called a Tacizza (a taco and pizza concoction--I'm not brave enough to try it).  It may not be the best market around, but it's better than nothing here in Hendertucky.  At least I know I can get some fresh and juicy tangelos on Thursdays!~honey, breads, hot dog taco pizza ~3
9SZjh75TGnyFjRUWUzPEuQ~25IHuoSHx-Ib2BHOiHuCXA~This place is gayer than a box of birds.  No, really, everyone in this place is denying themselves the reality of their sexual ardor; from the c*ckhungry bouncers whose cheap Express suits are actually managing to drape their puny frames like a weakling gang of pin-striped Ciceros; to the hypersexulized female bartenders, who lend their primary attention to the fraction of the clientele NOT ordering drinks (erm, the women who are looking for men to buy their Strawberry-Guava-Valtrex Mojito).  The bar itself is sorta cool.  There is a long L-shaped bar and a decent prom-style dance floor, that puts the d*ckheads dancing on parade for your entertainment.  But, then there's that damn 90's inspired decor that f'ing Scottsdale can't seem to get over.  Freaking couches in the bar, man.  Are we supposed to feel important because we're sitting on a g'damn suede sofa drinking a mid-range scotch?  Overall, everything but the booze here sucks.  The f-faces out front actually made me and the wolfpack group of 4 dudes actually wait in an invisible line outside of the door for at least 20 minutes so that they 1) could teach us a lesson that 4 dudes should not be rolling solo to Scottsdale clubs (they were right, but we were meeting the rest of the group inside, which included females) 2) give the impression that their club was worth a shite (they were wrong) 3) compensate for years of penis torment with this new-found power while making $8 an hour plus whatever crappy tips the bartenders decide to admit to them that they made that night.  Fucking avoid this place if you know what's good for you.~guava- ~1
9SZjh75TGnyFjRUWUzPEuQ~OrJH-Zq-XfDEM6m1It-4oA~I felt a SERIOUS urge to shake it and Dirty Pretty was up to the challenge. It was Dirty. It was Pretty. But I wouldn't call it a "Rockbar" in a million years.   The music started out pretty good. Top 40 dance music mixed in with a little something different every 3 or 4 songs. Only complaint about the DJ is that he was super ADD and only played like 20 seconds of a song and then changed it. Take your Adderall man and play the *entire* Single Ladies song so I can dance with my girlfriends!  I like the atmosphere but the dance floor was pretty small. The crowd was a good mix and drinks were reasonably priced. Best part was that I met some pretty interesting characters including Nostrovia Russia Free Shot Dude, the Tallest Man in the World, and capped it off with Mr. White Man Can't Dance. Ah, the memories.  Does it seem weird that I *really* loved the bathroom? The sign on the door of the "ladies" room said Sexy Bitches (see photo) and the best part is that there was not one, but TWO towel valets for a 3 stall bathroom. Really folks? I can tear off my own paper towel, but thanks. The valets were very sweet though considering what they probably have to deal with in a typical evening.   So yeah, this place was pretty great for a no pressure night out to dance.~white ~4
9SZjh75TGnyFjRUWUzPEuQ~bR_k7K5xpIn29gEJykmxyw~This place is everything that sucks about Scottsdale and more. However... lord help me, I had a good time (even though I couldn't leave fast enough). We got there before 11 on a Friday which is apparently early enough because there was no line to wait in and no cover to pay. The place was relatively empty and we were able to order drinks right away.  The service was good and everyone was sweet to us. Everyone in the place was young, well dressed and attractive. It didn't quite seem as douchey as I've been lead to believe. It just seemed like a bunch of young people having a good time. I expected to see more Affliction shirts than I did, but there were some.   A large group showed up wearing golfing attire - this is apparently some new college thing that I'm too old to know about. They seemed to be having a blast dancing like fools. I honestly felt like the place wasn't trying quite as hard as other places in the area... there was just something a little genuine about it that set it apart.   The drinks were expensive, the music was loud, the place was dark, and there was a VIP area. If you're a hot girl and you want to get dressed up and go dancing - you could do worse than here. If you're a young guy and you want to dance with some hot girls, you could also do worse.   It's totally not my kind of place, but I can't see a reason to say it's a fucking horrible experience. I mean, if what they're peddling is what you are looking for - this place is great.   I hate it and I probably won't be back. It deserves 4 stars though for being only mildly pretentious and for providing a solid place where people can apparently have a good time. I'm giving this 4 stars, but I had trouble deciding between that and 2 stars. I may revise this review at a later date.~date. ~4

I got in early this morning and they don't have the best looking pastries BUT once I got my muffin, it was by FAR the best blueberry muffin I have EVER had! but get one while you can, I went back later and they go quick!~pastries ~5
28hruDLwF_5s0QtDWH4rpg~huP0q8AM8QA_qroQrGw0tg~Well, the staff is really nice and friendly. The muffins are moist. The coffee is hot and the iced tea is iced and brewed to perfection. I really like the cafe as a whole. My only complaint is with the prices. I know it's a little expensive because its on campus. But does an iced tea and a muffin really need to $7? Overall though, great place to get a bite and hang out.~coffee tea tea ~4
28hruDLwF_5s0QtDWH4rpg~lP8DeFF24LL-sInJxK7Vsg~what can i say about a place like charlie's?   if you don't go to asu, there's no reason you would ever come here unless you were  visiting someone. actually, scratch that, you probably wouldn't ever come here unless you're a design student.  located on the second floor of design north, charlie's is the go-to break spot for students when they need a coffee fix.  during the school year, i come here daily (sometimes twice daily, depending on how many hours i've been in the building) and they always take care of my coffee needs.    the employees are super friendly and they make a great cup of coffee. they're always playing good music and they even do coffee art. cute!   they also carry bagels, sandwiches, pastries, naked juices, and bottled water if you're interested in that.  down the hall there's three vending machines that carry soda and snacks if you need a sugar fix.   oh and at 3pm they have happy hour (half off all drinks with espresso).~coffee coffee coffee. coffee sandwiches, pastries, ~4
7p5nQUsbutbyqMtuCCXY0w~3UxWW10zDP4Cpsj0u9YTkg~I'm a Hawaii resident that spent one week in Vegas at the Imperial Palace. Since I broke my wrist right before this trip, I was unable to blow out my hair and if you know me, I spend quite a few $$$ to upkeep my hair. For $40-$45 for shampoo and blow out, I decided to give the Salon at the IP a try; after all, other hotels like the Palms where going to charge me $75 for the same services. Marissa Medoro, Deborah Stephens and Nancy were AWESOME! This is truly a diamond in the rough. I was so happy with their service and the reasonable cost, I went 4-5 times for a wash and blow out and I even used their make-up application service or a special night on the town. A entire week in Sin City with frizzy, curly hair would have made me one unhappy gal, but these ladies made my stay in LV and the IP a very great one. Very talented professionals. Definitely see Marissa for a GREAT blow out and "Kim Kardashian" night out on the town fab makeup look.~curly ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~SId2k3guiJksAxh5S7Yv-A~5 stars for freshly cooked to order food, healthy options and low prices. The chicken is much better than the beef and I love that they include fresh fruit with the plate. My only gripes are that I asked for brown rice and they gave me white rice and the veggies arn't as plentiful as the description makes you think. *Update, I just realized I ordered the plate without veggies instead of the Works plate which does include lots of veggies.* Other than that Chix has very good service and they accept coupons you can find online from the My Sundevil Handbook or whatever. I would come back to Chix and order just a couple of sides of chicken instead of ordering a plate next time.~chicken beef brown white chicken ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~ip4OwHMte10oC-nQRPilhA~Chix Char Broiled Grill is what made me what to get on yelp. Why, you may ask? Because I think the establishment should be rewarded for its exceptional value. The meat, rice, and vegetables are all delicious, high quality, and healthy. Not to mention one only has to wait just a few minutes for the food. Anyone who would choose eating at the Memorial Union over this place, unless of course you only have a minute before class, needs to take ECON 101 over again! For five bucks you are in and out (not to be confused with the burger joint), having just eaten a healthy, satisfying meal.  Check it out - I promise that you'll love it!~burger ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~IN3_b0nSiz-MXeuAqEqbSg~I discovered this place while Yelping and I'm glad I did. They don't serve junk food like the fast food chains. The food is delicious and convenient. Their bowls are the perfect size and not pricey at all (even better for students). You can get bowls or plates with chicken, rib eye, pork you name it!   Ever heard of food pong? Try it out. Maybe you'll get a bowl for free! How awesome is that? Don't forget to get a punch card at the register. Buy nine bowls and get the tenth bowl on the house!~chicken, pork ~4
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~QKuEbIKrtYXr7LJHaVrrPA~I'm a big fan of Chix.  A healthy option for lunch and only $5 if you're an ASU student.  I prefer the white meat and brown rice, but that adds $1.50 to the tab, so I only get it every so often.  The mixture of the two sauces available with the meat and rice is an awesome concoction.  Definitely a good place to go!~white brown ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~xL4TePBkP_htp_9HJcKZCA~From the looks of the place, you probably wouldn't have high expectations.  They have a very limited menu: rice (white and brown), veggies, beef, and chicken.  That's about it.  But, of what they do have, I will say: good flavor, good quality, cooked well and very reasonably priced.  "The Works" plate I ordered was only $6.50 and it was huge.  The beef was rib-eye (one of the tastiest cuts of meat in my opinion) and it, along with the chicken, were perfectly grilled.  Not undercooked, not overcooked, tender and moist.  Also, I was impressed by the fact that they offered both white and brown rice.  Comparable places only offer white rice.  Sometimes, its those little things that make a difference.    If you liked Mai Island Grill, but not the price, the crowd, the line, or their hours, then you will most likely like Chix.  Personally, if Chix added a tasty mac salad, I would say it would serve as a suitable replacement for Mai Island.~white brown) beef, chicken. beef chicken, white brown white salad, ~4
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~g04nDQOnRd-J3GlEdxH0Mw~I can describe this place in four words: simple, healthy, delicious, and inexpensive!  I love this place. I'll start with the simple part. You can either order plates or bowls. The plates are the same as the bowls, but plus a side of salad and the fresh local fruit they have that day. As for the structure of the bowls, you can get some combination of meat, vegetables, and rice. For rice, you can choose between white and brown. The vegetables are just an assortment of the standard vegetables. The meat is either chicken or ribeye meat.  On to the healthy part: The rice is always steamed, never any oil, etc. added into anything! No trans fats in any of their dishes! The meat is charbroiled, in order to maintain the oil-free thing. The skin is removed from all of the chicken to reduce the fat content. This is probably the healthiest option for food anywhere near ASU.  Delicious: The sauce that they have is great. I would say it's some kind of modification of a teriyaki sauce, and you can tell a lot of effort went into that sauce. They only have the one sauce, but it is a great one. They have a cajun-hot sauce on the side, also, in case you want to add a little heat, which I usually do.   Inexpensive: The bowls are around $5.00. They don't look that big, but because they are so healthy, they will fill you up.   The first week I tried this place, I went back 3 times (3 days in a row). I cannot get enough of this place and I will be back soon.~salad white brown. chicken chicken ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~EoFaWp5zQBUAARbWU8_7xw~My first visit to Chix I tried the works bowl with brown rice. The chicken was sweet and juicy while the beef was tender and flavorful. Drizzle on some the the Chix house sauce, and you have a meal that satisfies without leaving you stuffed at the end. My only complaint would be the anemic vegetables (bok choi, broccoli, and carrots) that came with the bowl.   A satisfying meal near ASU for under $6. I'm in.~brown chicken beef broccoli, ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~9qJ6L7q9yi0x92gxNysuuA~I was craving some charbroiled chicken with rice and decided to try this place out. I had "the works" bowl because I wanted chicken but upon arrival the beef was tempting me. This way I can have both.  I felt that the food was just alright. The meat was cooked well but the flavor was lacking. They had some louisiana hot sauce on the counter with the pump style dispenser for those who want to add a little spice. It added some flavor to the meat but I felt Sriracha would've gone better with it.   Portions were good. Price was very reasonable. The guy at the counter was friendly and patient with me while I was deciding. I would say it's decent food but wouldn't make any special trips for it.~chicken chicken beef ~3
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~t5fG7YZdWzGnWcb73afVjg~In short: Amazing fresh food, at a good price, and awesome customer service to boot.  I went here by accident but probably the best accident ever, if there is such a thing.  It's unassuming and simple, even the menu isn't elaborated, I think 10 items total.  It looks like just another chicken bowl place, wrong!!! It's anything but that, the food was amazing.  They use really fresh ingredients, seasoning is perfect.  You don't get the cardboard chicken doused with teriyaki sauce like other places.  Texture and doneness of the meat was perfect. I tried the combination plate which had rib eye beef , chicken, lots of vegetables, a slaw style salad and half an orange.  The portions are huge and filling, and  the prices are great too, and I love their emphasis on good healthy food.  This is great place for a fast lunch or a good healthy meal.~chicken chicken beef , chicken, salad ~5
7NXSKpruXOrm9_INkZAFEQ~-Cyibj7XL8kY8ACVr5Zv_Q~Fresh chicken or beef bowls at a super cheap prices, but keep in mind you get what you pay for.   I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with my overall experience.  When I ordered the chicken veggie bowl and asked for no rice I was expecting more vegetables, not a hidden pile of cabbage. I had actually asked for a plate, but got a bowl, either way the bowl was good, the veggies were crisp and you  can customize your sauces.  Don't use the bathroom and don't expect a clean interior.  3 stars is generous, but if I was low on cash I would go back.~chicken beef chicken cabbage. ~3

FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~U3OJF2mczTdZI3Cc4X8UHQ~Went here on a Saturday morning after hearing about this place from the family that I am staying with this summer. Here are my thoughts:  Parking- Street parking available right outside Decor- Nice place, there are some comfy couches and ample tables and chairs available. There is also a large fireplace inside.  Service: All of the folks at EVP coffee that I interacted with were caring and friendly! Coffee- I got the bottomless brew for $2.75. Unlimited coffee, and self serve. I tried 4 different kinds of coffee brews, a fruity organic ethiopian, a nicaraguan french roast, an italian dark roast, and one other which I forgot. All were pretty good! Food- I tried the Chipotel chicken sandwich, served with Stella's spicy jalapaneo cheese bread. It was pretty tasty!  Overall, this is a nice place to get some work done and enjoy some good, local coffee.~coffee coffee, coffee chicken sandwich ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~aWnbXl0abbbkottLYTdI3A~Wow, a place where you really feel welcome.  A new friend of mine introduced me to the Fitchburg EVP coffee shop this summer.  I love the friendly service.  Paul is the owner and is there most of the time when I stop in.  He is always very personable and just the kind of positive energy that I love to be around.  The physical space is nice, clean, and inviting.  Interesting art on display.  The patio is a nice option as well.  Paul is very good at supporting local in his business.  This coffee shop is conveniently located just off of Fish Hatchery Rd. by the new "green" library.  You must check it out! Lori Carlson, Oregon~coffee coffee ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~9kWMOYcUBvB8xLHIWetq9A~Awesome.  Excellent.  Their Kenyan coffee is one of the best coffees I've ever had.  Plus they have cute little plants everywhere, so who doesn't like that?  I was visiting someone in the area and discovered EVP.  Over a week I went here quite a few times and found the staff to be consistently really friendly and very helpful.  Their coffee is good and their food is good.  I've had espresso drinks, which were perfectly made, some of the food, and some of their medium roast coffees.  The only negative thing I have to say is that some of their pastries aren't the greatest, but as far as I can tell those are ordered in from somewhere else.  Their stuff made in house is fabulous.  Also, don't go here and order regular coffee if you're in a hurry on a Saturday, or even a late morning.  A few times I went, they had run out of coffee and I had to wait for new batches to be brewed.  I didn't mind at all, but if you're in a rush, this could be a problem.  Overall, I don't think that these two negative aspects impact EVP's overall awesomeness.  And for the love of god, order the pelmeni!  It's unique and really delicious.~coffee coffee pastries coffee coffee ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~sL0DkeJ70oPmFxMxcSs_Jg~Good coffee, good food, good service! A very nice place with a pleasant patio, the staff is always friendly and they have a nice grab-a-cup/throw-money-in-the-box kind of deal in the mornings, genius!~coffee, ~4

I am usually in a rush and forget these folks are here, they're set back a little ways off Fish Hatchery road but, definitely worth the stop in.

FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~34lI8LUdtHsy5F0ZMVyTPA~This place is phemominal! First of all, it is a coffee shop that serves food over lunch hours. The coffee is decent but it's really the food and the service that make this place shine.  All the sandwhiches on the menu are delicious and made with Boar Head's meat. The real gem are the Russian Dumplings called Pelmeni. These are meat and potato dumplings with melted butter, cilantro, curry powder, and spicy sauce, eaten with sour cream on the side. If you never had them, you are missing out! I probably go here at least once a week for the dumplings. Call ahead to see if they have them because they are so popular, sometimes they run out mid-week. All the ingredients are also local.  The owners are great and I love supporting this local buisness! They also have free wifi and a children's play area. This place is worth the stop in.~coffee coffee potato butter, cilantro, sour cream ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~aoCW7OUwkHvEQcmXkbQWpA~Their version of a Cappuccino is a latte with some airy foam on top. Low selection of pastries. OK ambiance, but usually busy and difficult to find a place to sit. Wi-Fi available, but slow and unreliable...~pastries. ~2
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~DOIJUNEn98-JqtRUf1jkJg~I've been going here for awhile, since it's very close to work for me.  And I've loved it always.  They recently added sandwiches, soups and pelmeni around the lunch hour.  The sandwiches are clearly made with high-quality ingredients--I love the good, fresh bread.  The creamy tomato basil is incredible. Last time I was there, a woman actually bought a giant tub of it.  So I'm not the only one in love with that soup.  I tried the pelmeni dumplings for the first time on Friday, and devoured them.  In addition to wonderful coffee and food, the ambiance is really great and the staff are really kind and personable, especially the owner, Paul.  I love sitting out on their patio and sipping iced tea.~sandwiches, sandwiches tomato soup. coffee tea. ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~HIod0Dbyg9NVesr95ysNKA~Recently discovered this place.  Really great experience. Nice interior, interesting design.  Plenty of space.  Some nice big tables for a group of 6 and some cozy small spaces to sit back and browse the net or read a paper or good book.  Pleasant staff, patient, friendly. Very clean including the bathrooms.  Great coffee and great food.~coffee ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~1OzZH-kTzt_Pv67g6avcWA~I tried this place because it is conveniently located on East Washington.  As this was my first visit, I was a little intimidated. I ordered a simple Cafe Mocha with skim milk. I immediately regretted my choice as I was able to peek and see over twenty bottles of syrup.   They were covered with clutter and I couldn't even tell what kind of syrup was being offered. If you are not going to show them to the customer, at least make a list and put it somewhere.  The coffee was good and the prices were great. Honestly, I was really impressed with it. I would definitely go back.~milk. coffee ~4
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~tgrtxhGsx8kzpz7JGKQiTw~Paul is great, knows a lot of his customers, great coffee selection.  Lunch was tasty, but I really only stop there in the morning.  Local yogurt in the case and pastries made in town...Bear Claw is outstanding.~coffee pastries bear claw ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~idjaAY4j1f2a4ykeNpbtFw~EVP is an awesome coffee/lunch shop and unlike a lot of places, manages to get them both right. Their coffee is great, regardless of whether you're after a frou-frou drink or just a cup of fresh brewed, and I second the review that recommends their Pelmeni. Seriously- this is the best winter lunch ever. Soft, pillowy dough filled with potatoes or meat (or half of each), covered in butter, curry, hot sauce and/or sour cream.   In warmer months, there's outdoor seating on their terrace, making it a great location for a weekday lunch and since it's generally shaded, you don't have to worry about going back to work sweaty.~coffee butter, sour cream. ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~ZJp6b-c2vM12HtmrcE6Wrw~Although new on the scene in Fitchburg, EVP has established its self as the place to go for coffee in the area. They offer a great selection of freshly brewed coffee from around the world,which they roast in Madison at their East Washington location. These include such offerings as Colombian,Nicaraguan,Honduran,Costa Rican,Panamanian,Mexican,Peruvian,El Salvadorian,Brazilian,Ugandan,Ethiopian,Kenyan,Tanzanian AA, and Peaberry,East Timor,Sulawesi,New Guinea,Sumatran, Java, and a variety of decaf also. The Lattes here are always great, and it really seems like the barista/manager, Paul truly cares about giving you sa good drink for your hard earned cash. At $4.00 for a twenty oucne whole milk latte, its a great value. They use Girhadelli*(sp?) chocolate in their mochas, which are also awesome, and only $4.50 even for a twenty ounce. Thgey carry a full line of Rishi teas,greens,blacks,herbal,caf free, hot or iced,just specify. This is a really nice spot, and a great place to go relax in front of the fireplace in wintertime. Very quiet,very chill, very good quiet music, an overall 10. Good job Fitchburg for getting this place,lets hope you support it enough to keep it. :-) Also, it has free Wi-Fi,good pastries from La Brioche delevired daily, and homemade soups which are all vegetarian, and good. Soup is $4.00 and served with a big hunk of fesh sourdough bread. You can have it either there or to go. They also offer a bottomless cup of fresh brewed coffee for 2.75, and you can even leave and then come back later for another refill. If you bring your own mug/cup, you save $0.25 cents on any drink too,any day, all the time. Great deal for someone with some work to do on the laptop. Suck down the best coffee in Wisconsin for 6 hours, for only $2.75?!~coffee coffee milk greens, pastries soup coffee coffee ~5

FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~BFZnSmALIUtSZ2BRo716gw~This place is a well-kept secret. They have excellent coffees along with pastries and a wide sandwich selection. I have had the California BLT and really enjoyed it. Must be the avocado. I'll post a pic. The owners are very friendly and accommodating to whatever you would like. Visit sometime when you're not in a hurry. It's a quiet place with a homey atmosphere and free Wi-Fi. We always stop by when we are in Fitchburg.~pastries sandwich avocado. ~5
FRcQz8VyxuIGHGl-v_ri4Q~rkU3ILbZZilYJdXUft-Erw~Good consistent coffee. Better than Starbucks.  I love the Fitchburg location for space, ambiance, and service the best.

BOYFqToD2lIZga7Rg8k6FA~f60ofpZCxjTOruOFD3hmZQ~Took my girlfriends 6 year old daughter here for a manicure and pedicure. The experience was awesome! This Salon is tailored to pamper kids and make little girls feel like princesses.  Set me back 45 Bucks for a manicure and pedicure. Well worth every penny. The staff does a great job working with kids. As you can imagine giving a six year old a manicure and pedicure can be quite difficult if your child can't sit still. My girlfriends daughter messed up her toes twice and Eushika repainted them free of charge both times. There is an ice cream theme hence the name scooops and every kid gets ice cream with their service. Well done!~ice cream ice cream ~5
BOYFqToD2lIZga7Rg8k6FA~-QxlFCZQxkQ4x_1rWK2qYg~Went in for a mom and me pedicure expecting and experience to parallel that of a regular salon or even a nail shop in the mall. For the price, the experience should be similar, if not better.  Here was my experience. Moms, your big  massage spa chair with jets in the water has been replaced by a warm bowl of water. There will be no buffing of calluses or cuticle repair. There will be strawberry/vanilla/chocolate scented exfoliating scrub. The nail polish is so cheap that you can see through it. On the bright side, you get to take a small bottle home. Your normal pedicure that you pay $45 that takes a hour will be replaced by a 15 min nail polish change that still costs $45. You will receive a small scoop of ice cream. However, when mine was served, it was completely melted. The nail lady apologized and said she was sorry it was so melted.I joked and asked for a straw. She didn't offer to replace it. I still haven't figured out why you would even serve melted ice cream.  Everyone wears pick robes, but the place is hot and my daughter complained that it was too warm to wear it.  If you're willing to pay extraordinary prices for a terrible polish change with a tierra, go here. If you'd like a real pedicure, so to the place in Hilldale. It's less expensive and a better experience. Scooops couldn't even give my daughter the flower on her big toenail that she requested.~ice cream. ice cream. ~1
BOYFqToD2lIZga7Rg8k6FA~efs_6iHrrPNhLxOfmC9-YA~The staff was washing each others' hair during our appt. Although our tech was kind and sweet, the rest of them were completely unprofessional. I think the chipping of the polish can be attributed to the inferior quality of the products used. I can't believe I paid over 40$ for the two of us. The ice cream is not a scoop in a cone, but a little cup with the paper lid pulled off. Too bad, it's a nice concept, but very poorly executed, especially for a place like Hilldale.~ice cream ~2

Royal Paan is in an area I hardly frequent.. especially at night! GPS took me to this strip plaza, the only one in the intersection that were packed with parked car. Smell of spices and curries so thick in the air....  I just cannot eat anymore...... KO for the night but then I saw a DVD store.. My Yelp Friend last stop is for me to look at  Bollywood DVDs? What were all these men doing lining up for what?  Paan is a tradition practice of chewing betel leafs with areca nut and slaked lime paste. Paan is claimed to be chewed as a palate cleanser, a breath freshener, and for digestive purposes.* That's sounded like a perfect ending to our Food Crawl....  But chewing leafs was the last thing I had in my mind when I saw all the pictures of Lassi and Falooda......  Royal Falooda ($3.49)  - Falooda is an adaptation of the non-liquid Persian dessert Faloodeh - a hint of rose syrup with vermicelli and jello and ice cream sprinkled with grounded pistachio - drinking this liquid dessert through a jumbo straw remind me of Vietnamese iced drink experience!  Royal Lassi ($2.99) - taste similar to the Royal Falooda but it just a yogurty drink with Rosewater syrup... - I told my Yelp Friend drink up that's good for him!

You WILL get lost exploring the countless gift items, journals, greeting cards, and gift wraps.  There is a selection of rubber stamps, seals, scrapbooking items, photo albums, calendars, origami supplies, funky file folders and other office supplies. This is the place to go to find a gift for that crafty friend, the correspondent, the reader, or the self-reflector.  If you're throwing a party, you can find (or make!) the invites, thank you cards, cupcake liners and toppers, and gift bags here. As another reviewer suggested, I also have a couple of framed papers acting as art at home... very inexpensive to change when you're feeling like mixing it up! Staff are friendly and helpful, and the store is bright and inviting.~wraps. ~5
3kth9Q4R5qBYdd9TG8AJ1Q~n38ohqDgiJnKZdgePkMtKg~This store has a great selection, and a good variety of supplies. That being said, I think some of the employees are either a little green or just lack the knowledge necessary to fully inform their customers.  I placed a paper order with them after their recommendation to buy larger pieces and then cut them down to the proper size (I had to buy all the tools  necessary for cutting as well). They informed me of the shipping costs and estimated delivery date; I agreed, but was hesitant because it seemed like it wasn't the most optimal choice.   Upon leaving the store, I visited the website of the paper company they ordered from. Not only can I order custom-cut pieces (at an extra cost of $3!!!), but the delivery (directly to my house) costs less, and is delivered in half the time.   When the order came in, I brought the cutting supplies with me and returned them. I explained my (completely justified) frustration with the associate working that day. She said she "didn't know why" the lady I originally spoke with didn't recommend a custom order and said I should speak with her. That didn't fly with me and I said I wanted my money back for the paper. She spoke with the manager who refused to come out and speak to me face-to-face and without apology, gave me a refund. When I said "thank you," all she said was "umm, hmm..." and began to help the next in line.   Nice. Chances of me stopping by this store again are extremely thin, to say the least. I was clearly upset, but never rude to them. It was a mistake on their part that I wanted corrected. Since they ended up correcting their mistake, but showed no apologetic behaviour: 2 stars.~date; ~2
1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q~gNshx1ODwJGjafosVGNwzg~This place has a very good reputation, as evidenced by the 5 star reviews from Kay L and Ann M.  It's very popular with locals, and is regularly busy, and we found it so on our visit. Dishes were accurate and tasty, but they weren't particularly outstanding. Their risotto lacked moisture, for me, and the pasta was good but not great. It's a very cute little place, though, and the service is very good, so it's worth a visit.  Overall, we said: "La Bruschetta was a very decent local Italian. I understand why it attracts its loyal following. They have a sound and commendable commitment to serving fresh, local ingredients, but it would be lovely to see more innovation in their dishes, to raise things above "solid and reliable". For now, yes go and visit, but I'm not sure you'll be blown away."~risotto pasta ~3
1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q~MB2oAzeco71BzNTuBrGS2Q~Oh my lord, my tastebuds are still doing a wee happy dance - I've had the kind of food that makes you want to not pollute your mouth with anything substandard....  All that heralds one of the best Italian restaurants in Edinburgh is an inauspicious burnished red awning just across from Haymarket Station...  The kitchen is full of Italian voices and incredible smells; the restaurant is packed with regulars and locals, some speaking Italian to the wonderful old waiters, some simply enjoying an incredible meal.  Gamberoni with a side of spinacci fills my nostrils and, when I try it, it makes me chew slowly, making the "I can't believe it's legal to eat this in public" face.  The chicken dish is, apparently, orgasmic.  Happy faces (and tastebuds!) all round!  The spinacci was so simple and so good that it subsequently launched a google recipe search and repeated trips to Sainsbury's for ingredients over the following months while I perfected it.  I often think that good food allows you to guess at the ingredients but no one ingredient stands out as overpowering the others.  It should create a sensation that's like looking at a piece of art: you don't always see the brush strokes that create the whole piece.  La Bruschetta does this well.  The food made me want to re-learn the language just so I could appreciate all the nuance of it.  Like any (proper) Italian place, they're closed on Sunday and Monday, but it's well worth making a booking for a table at this wonderful wee piece of Italy.~chicken ~5
1yjwJdeSbQ-h3zmrJrH92Q~zXZx4TyQaNK4eDLK_Ud8WA~Don't be put off by the outside.  It's the inside that counts :-)  We went there ad hoc and were so lucky to have gotten the last table for two in this small restaurant.  Yes, sadly the table was in the centre of the restaurant surrounded by all the other tables, but in the end, I was so impressed by the food that I totally forgot where I was sitting. It's really not a large place. The restaurant has about 8 tables with 2 tables of 4. Best you make a reservation on the weekend, as they seem very busy, no doubt. The clientele is more of the older upmarket generation with some young ones thrown in, who seem to enjoy a memorable evening out. Maybe for a special occasion, considering that this place is not cheap. Having said this, you definitely get your money worth of quality.  I ordered a fillet carpaccio with ruccola as a starter, veal in bread crumbs alla milanese (served with capers,  slices of lemon and anchovies) as a main and vanilla ice cream with amaretto as dessert. And yes, I still wonder how I ate it all :-)  Each of these dishes was served to its highest standards.  I still taste the soft and perfectly cut carpaccio with a hint of lemon or the amaretto touched vanilla ice cream perfectly proportioned.  The waiters were all Italian and efficient. Yes, we only got a two hours slot, but this was plenty. The food just kept coming. No delays, considering this place was packed.  The Prosecco was also Italian and of class! Not a brand I normally drink. I can definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out in general or for a special occasion.  And what's good? It's just opposite Haymarket.  Easy accessible for everyone!~capers, lemon ice cream lemon ice cream ~5

0qTo0ktehcCKsYc5l1NKpg~NzgfFvZdsHmw7RS560p0wg~When you walk in to this newly built restaurant, the first thing besides the "new building" smell that you'll notice is the enormous menu. If this menu was a house, it'd be a mansion. If it was a boat, Bill Gates would own it.   As you navigate the menu you'll find burgers, sandwiches, salads, sides, shakes, "Concrete Mixers", it screams America and Wisconsin in one breath. I ordered the Cheddar (Butter)Burger with Bacon (double of course) value basket with cheese curds. My order was taken quickly and efficiently, and while the place was busy (there were not many available parking spots) we were able to find a seat for 4 people without issue.  We waited a few minutes, but not too long (especially given how busy it was), to receive our food at our table.  If you remember nothing else from this review, CHEESE CURDS. ORDER THEM. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. These little fried balls of joy exist to make people happy. It reminds one of cheese sticks but it straps it to a rocket and enters outer space, the final frontier of good taste.   The burger was good, I didn't realize when I ordered that for that specific burger you have to ask for lettuce/tomato and other condiments (I'll keep that in mind for next time). It was a good sized burger, the patties were cooked in a way that reminded me of Steak 'n Shake. The bun was fresh. I get the feeling that the cheese is just the highlight of this restaurant. (Remember to order the cheese curds)  I thought the service was good, they have staff in the dining room to take your tray if you're done and deliver food to your table a la Chick-Fil-A.   Overall, this is a good place with good food and good service (order the cheese curds).~burgers, sandwiches, salads, bacon ( cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese burger burger burger, steak ' cheese cheese cheese ~4

1thLC93uCmmNvxxzxNoZag~CQuitTImnVh1WWRV_kZxmA~This place sucks!!! Joe Baselice is an incompetent moron....at least thats the only conclusion I can come to since we never got to speak to him in 6 years. This office is a nightmare of incompetence. They will screw up your paperwork causing you penalty....they will ignore your phone calls......they will not return phone calls as they say they will. They are unapologetic and unprofessional. They overcharged when we added a second vehicle to our insurance plan so badly that they cost us over $120.00 in overdraft fees. Because of this the bank actually reversed those charges but farmers will now be seeing us in small claims court after they decided to short us again of a couple hundred dollars  when they finally sent our refund for the time paid after cancellation. We had great service for 16 years in Northern Arizona with farmers Insurance but the crap we have endured from Joe Baselice and his Farmers office has been an abject failure completely caused by this offices work practices....or lack thereof. We contacted Liberty Mutual and spoke with Tim Allen directly....within half an hour we had a new plan with better coverage and a savings of over $1200.00 a year. We had some follow up questions and again it was Tim Allen himself who spoke with us....not a know nothing desk girl....who is probably chewing gum and twisting her hair with her finger.  See you in court Joe.~chewing gum ~1
40o-_QAm2UTFrugmqjGMiA~g9NhgxVgPyuS3LXuiNI0yw~First, let me just say that I like Starbucks and that I'm amazed how they manage to create good quality product consistently across thousands of stores. This store is no exception: Their barristas know how make a good drink.  However, Starbucks is more than a coffee shop. To me, it has become my boardroom and my office. And for a coffee shop to fulfill this function, they need to have a decent Internet connection.  Alas, here, WIFI Internet hardly ever works. On a few occasions I'd come and get my drink and a scone, sit at a table and pop my laptop open only to realize that I wouldn't be able to do much work that day. So after a while I started checking the WiFi connection BEFORE ordering the drink. If it was down, out the door I would go and drive 200 meters to a Country Style just south of there. And now, when I'm in the area, I don't even go to this Starbucks anymore.~coffee coffee ~2
40o-_QAm2UTFrugmqjGMiA~fTTj4YkinBdwmt3eB0NKDQ~Are all cake pops raw?! I don't want to bash this location if it's a Starbucks thing but man, I won't be getting another one of these suckers. They are gross.  As for the sandwiches and drinks, they are made perfectly and to my likings. The staff at this location are pleasant too and often social (whether it be with you or their friends popping in). This Starbucks also has a drive thru which is convenient. I also like that this location has a community board - I thought that was a nice touch.   I'm not going to hinder their rating due to the crappy cake pops only because I have a feeling the food is made elsewhere and shipped in. But honestly, as someone who enjoys baking... I sample the goods before giving to others. I don't know how they miss this on a regular basis. I should add that if this is normal, it's disgusting and I'm not the only one who agrees.  http://www.eatandbemerryblog.com/2011/03/starbucks-cake-pop.html~cake sandwiches cake ~4
40o-_QAm2UTFrugmqjGMiA~j0R982fYjxTlQ69hjY8nIw~like Starbucks. Actually I love Starbucks. And I love this location. It was renovated last year and looks great. There is a lot of seating, its lit nicely, its clean, and the folks that work here are super! Ask them anything about your drink or treat!  I know I know its pricy but I like what I get.  I usually get the chai latte. I get it lactose free. They have three options. One - lactose free milk, Two - soy (its nice try it), Three - with coconut milk (its new trying it right now, I like it, doesn't over power). The chai latte is spicy and creamy. Get it without water for a really strong spice kick, that's how I like it. My other go to drink is the cinnamon dulce latte, equally a delight.  Treats, I like the oat fudge bars,scones, and coojies. Chocolate goodness. Ask them to heat it up for you for an extra special treat!  Sandwiches, this is going to sound gross but its delicious. I love the Thai tuna wrap - heated up. They'll question if you really want to, but trust me you do! I am also completely obsessed with the the feta and spinach breakfast wrap. Yum!  So if you happen to find yourself at the corner of Gorham and Leslie in Newmarket, stop in, they have WiFi ( and it occasionally works!). Or better yet, they have one of the few drive thrus that I've seen~milk, coconut milk ( sandwiches, thai tuna spinach ~4

4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~O4FRk9rS6UQolyHJyXkHsg~At first I was a little underimpressed with Moo Cafeteria. Upon showing up on an oddly glorious Saturday afternoon, we wanted to sit outside, and after some persuasion, the four of us were allowed to take 2 of the indoor chairs outside while the manager wasn't looking. Not sure if that is the lady who came out to take our order, but man, she seemed really annoyed at having to deal with us. With me being the odd one out by ordering falafel, and the rest cake (oh damn you, diet! The glee to which the cakes were ordered was NOT FAIR). The falafel came out a little later than the rest of the order, and when they came out, my oh my, in the spirit of ACDC, I had big balls (of falafel, that is).   The only problem is, they were too big, and raw in the centre, which I slowly worked out as I tucked into them. So into the cafe I trotted, plate in hand. The waitress immediately apologised and took my plate back into the kitchen. Now here is the kicker of a good cafe - do they scrape off the offending part of the meal, or provide an entire new dish? Well, Moo gave me the latter, with smaller balls, which had clearly been checked before being sent out to me. I like that - it makes me feel happy that the chef didn't intend the same mistake to happen twice.   Where I wouldn't say wow, they were the best falafel in the world, they were tasty bites, freshly made and the plate overall was nicely presented. Despite one of the ladies who served us original ill-humour, she was lovely when my plate was returned to me and full of apology. I would definitely go back, and most importantly when I can test out their cake range.~cake ( cake ~4
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~vT_gnjQumLivabqJPEt3xA~All the other reviews for Moo seem positive so maybe we just caught them on a bad day, but safe to say we shall not be going back! We'd decided against Circle further down the street as all the condensation on the windows made it look a bit sweaty but with hindsight, condensation = lots of people = popular. Anyway, I digress.   So we ended up in Moo which has slightly quirky decoration; the highlight (or should that be lowlight?) was a perspex box with a display made from children's farm animals ('Moo' - I get it!) which may have been hilariously ironic when placed there but over the years has become dusty and just a bit grubby. A couple of sad little cows have also bitten the dust so it's actually just a box with some jumbled toys in it.  Anyway, we only wanted drinks and I ordered hot chocolate. We'd been out for a walk and it was freezing so I was really looking forward to a steaming mug with, hopefully, some whipped cream and possibly even a marshmallow or three. I was gutted when not only did I not get any of these hot chocolate accessories but my 'hot' chocolate was more like 'luke warm at best' chocolate. My friend ordered milkshake and was excited by the fact that Moo proclaimed on the menu that it was made with Luca's ice cream. How could it fail?! By grinding ice cubes into it, not ice cream, that's how. Meanwhile, the boyfriend and friend No2 sat sipping tea and looking smug as we exclaimed with dismay over each fresh disappointment.~milkshake ice cream. ice cream, tea ~1
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~sFk9S7ERc5kQ6PjvhbTi0w~This weekend I was put in charge of finding a Friday night dinner venue for 8 people. Requirements: Hearty food, on a budget + veggie options.  A number of my favourite haunts made the short-list, but in the end I opted for Moo & I'm very glad I did!  Every Friday evening, Moo hold a burger night and it's BYOB (with no corkage fee!). The restaurant advertises the night as running from 6pm 'til 9pm, but on booking, the owner was happy to agree that we could use the venue after this time. Our table reservation was for 8pm and we stayed until just after 10pm. The staff didn't rush us at all & we had an excellent time.  The food:  The burger night portions at Moo are very generous and we were full to the brim on leaving. The menu offers a choice of no-fuss starters (garlic bread, soup, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, coleslaw & salad) and a selection of five main course burger toppings that can be served with a beef, chicken or bean burger. All main courses are served with salad, coleslaw and a portion of seriously tasty hand-cut, homemade chips.  I opted for a chicken burger, topped with bacon & Mull of Kintyre cheddar - it was absolutely delicious. The only disappointment was that the bread was rather ordinary. Tasty rolls from a local Edinburgh bakery would bump my rating up to 5 stars.  The service:  The owners and other staff at Moo are friendly, helpful and attentive.   Originally, I'd booked our table for 8.30pm, but moved our reservation to 8pm at quite short notice - the restaurant had no issue at all with this.  The Moo website had unfortunately been hacked and the burger menu was unavailable to download (issue now resolved), but within a few minutes of coming off the phone, the owner had emailed a copy to me, so that I could share it with friends.   We brought along a selection of prosecco, white wine & red wine (from the wonderful Cornelius on Easter Road) and as Moo charge no corkage fee this made a massive difference to the total bill; a very pocket-friendly £8 per head!  For hearty food on a budget, I highly recommend burger nights at Moo Cafeteria.  Moo can be reached by bus on the #23, #27 and #8 routes and is well-placed for after dinner drinks in Canonmills, Broughton Street & Stockbridge.~burger burger garlic soup, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, coleslaw & salad) burger beef, chicken burger. salad, coleslaw chips. chicken burger, bacon & burger white burger ~4
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~Hlu5FdASse976BHS3JqtTg~This quirky little cafe down in Canonmills is great fun - the interior is one of my favourites in the city. Quirky patterns and colourful walls really contrast against the shiny white shop-front.  I love all day breakfasts but these days not even Little Chef can give you something satisfying (thanks for nothing, Heston). Generous portions of fried, but not weighty, food that made my hangover vanish. It was good quality cooking with good quality ingredients. It must be hard work sorting out the daily-changing menu for creative husband and wife combo but it hasn't yet seemed to have compromised any of the little details.~white ~5

4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~x1gxUVZYBdwMY567vbE_DA~The breakfast here is mooooovelous!no?.it was worth a shot. Anyways, it's so beautifully decorated and mega child friendly. There's loads to look at. I especially love the retro computer they have up on the way to the loos. They're cooked breakfasts are great and their scrambled egg is sooo good! Highly recommend for a cafe that stands out from the rest (for all the right reasons!)~egg ~5
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~5IZiQUCepr3Ufppg05BaiQ~Went there last Sunday after a quick check out on yelp for a cooked breakfast with my friend Jon. We wanted some egg and bacon but fancied escaping the South and West of Edinburgh, where we both stay.  The place is neat and the location is really nice, just a short stroll away from the Royal Botanic Gardens and New Town. If it hadn't been for the pesky rain we would have probably enjoyed a nearby park after eating.  Big teapot with enough milk to my liking. Breakfast ingredients looked fresh and seemed of a good quality. The only downer was that I'm not a huge fan of Scottish breakfast containing haggis and black pudding (giblets in general), I much prefer the more English variant with mushrooms or tomatoes. Still filling though.  Free wifi, and you can pay by card.~egg bacon milk mushrooms ~4
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~JWwB-aJDjoprY_VQtZdlmw~Brunch at Moo is one of my favourite weekend pastimes - with a great selection from scrambled egg and smoked salmon to a cooked vegetable snack that would make any meat-eater consider converting to vegetarianism. The smoothies are refreshing and filling, and the staff are always smiling. I've taken friends, family and even in-laws(!) there and they've all been delighted.   Their BYOB burger night is also a great one for hungry tummies looking for good quality grub and fab flavour combinations!~egg smoked salmon ~5
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~coID3LtZPhairu8JJx3AEQ~As this place has opened for business on a site that's already been an Indian restaurant and, most recently and for only about 6 months, an Egyptian steak house + it has similar established competition to the left and an offshoot of the Urban Angel "empire" along the road to the right I'm glad I've finally managed to get in and check it out as none of the above boded well for it I thought yet it's clear form going past on the bus that it's a bright and freshly decorated establishment that always looks welcoming.    That said I've never seen it very busy but on having finally stepped across the threshold I can't actually see any reason why this should be the case - the staff are friendly, the background music is well chosen and at a decent level and they clearly cater to families and customers of all ages with a small but no nonsense menu.    If I'd paid more attention upon entering I'd not have been surprised that my rabbit and carrot pie was of the Scotch variety rather than the cottage (they have them clearly displayed in a case on the counter). That aside it was packed to bursting with meat so no complaints there. The handmade chips were delicious but could have been slightly crisper (there were more on the plate to begin with than are shown in the photo as I'd tucked in before it occurred to me to take the pic). They operate a system whereby you choose your dish and then the price of that covers the addition of the side order you choose to accompany it. £6 for my pie and chips was I felt very reasonable. Just over two cups of tea in a pot at £1.70 and a reasonable flapjack (could have been just a tad moister) at £1.20 rounded things off.    I'd happily go back again and have only hedged at 3 stars as I didn't check out the bathroom facilities.~steak carrot pie chips pie chips tea ~3
4sxYF7wGRY55Pq8lOSNQJg~ZbWy_T4V-qnzJll6fmsCRg~My favourite place to go for breakfast!  It's a quirky place with very friendly staff, I've never had bad service there once. Their breakfasts are consistently good and they make fab fresh juices and milkshakes. The breakfast menu is varied, definitely something for all tastes and appetites! Lunch menu looks good too and I always like the sound of their soup of the day. Very reasonably priced  I'd happily go every day if I could!~soup ~4
-d9eo_0k-crYTmLy3jdUAw~t3rwo9Ewbr0-pkCiIuWpXQ~Allgemein Das La Fuente in Echterdingen wird von Evangelos Papadakis - Spitzname "Lucky" seit Ende 2013 neben seinem Hauptrestaurant Taverne SIGMA in Leinfelden betrieben. In den letzten Jahren waren in diesem Restaurant, einst Ristorante "La Montanara", die Pächter weniger erfolgreich. Umso mehr waren wir nun gespannt, wie sich ein spanisches Restaurant unter griechischer Leitung macht. Bedienung Nachdem sich 2 Tage zuvor Spanien aus der WM verabschieden musste, war es im Restaurant wie erwartet relativ ruhig. Allerdings wurden wir beim Betreten des Gastraums nach freundlicher Begrüßung durch die Dame im Service gefragt, ob wir im Hauptraum mit Fernseherbeschallung, oder eher ruhiger im Nebenraum essen wollten - wir wählten letzteres. Zudem tauchte im Laufe des Abends noch eine zweite männliche Servicekraft auf, die nur gebrochen Deutsch, aber dafür umso besser spanisch sprach. Die kleine, sehr übersichtliche Karte war schnell gelesen. Das Essen Die beiden Weine, ein Weißwein Verdejo do Rueda 0,2 für 4,90 € und ein Roter Rioja Bordon Crianza 0,2 für 5,80 € kamen zügig und richtig temperiert. Das Essen dauerte nicht lange, es war ja auch recht wenig los, lediglich noch 3 weitere Tische besetzt. Bei den Speisen wählten wir von der Tageskarte zuerst "Gazpacho Andaluz" 2,90 € kalte, gut gewürzte Tomatensuppe in akzeptabler Qualität. Anschließend "Fischplatte für 2 Personen" 24,90 €, Dorade, Tintenfisch, Garnelen, Fischcroquetas, Sardellen, gefüllte Miesmuscheln und Aioli. Praktisch alles frittiert, jedoch ohne Fettgeruch und gut abgetropft. Durch die Bank schmeckte alles angenehm gewürzt, vor allem die gefüllten Miesmuscheln. Sicherlich wird hier vieles als Convenience Fertigprodukt zugekauft, doch die Qualität war zufriedenstellend. Auch an der Aioli war nichts auszusetzen. Keine Geschmacksüberraschungen und auch in keiner weise mit meinen letzten Besuchen in San Sebatián und Bilbao zu vergleichen, doch einfach und solide.  Das Ambiente Das Restaurant ist sehr, sehr einfach ausgestattet, die Wände halbhoch ochsenrot oben weiß. Wenige Bilder und eine Spanien-Flagge bringen noch kein Spanien Feeling. Im Hauptraum eine Eckbank und ansonsten einfache Holzstühle und Tische. Das Besteck ligt mit Papierservietten in Tellern aud den Tischläufern. Und wie eingangs erwähnt an der Bar ein Fernseher, doch die Bar eignet sich nur für Getränke und Speisenausgabe, nicht wie in einer spanischen Tappas Bar zum Verweilen während des Essens. Sauberkeit Auch hier kann man nicht meckern, im Großen und Ganzen recht sauber.~gazpacho ~3
-d9eo_0k-crYTmLy3jdUAw~2IJElG22dXI-XNm_Gttfzw~This was recommended by the hotel staff and they didn't let them down. Tapas were delicious and service was very friendly with excellent English.

-brx5K_-S5UEdm3aOP6lSA~KiRJPEPf2XqFSOK4PONuxA~Great Greasy Spoon!  SO MUCH FOOD!  Some days I think about ordering my meal with out the home fries, but then think again.  The staff are amazing!  Ask for Stacey, she's so much fun and is always fast!  She's just about to have a baby and this girl can still move!  It's a great hang over place and the prices are reasonable.  On the other hand the bathrooms leave something to be desired.~home fries ~4

Service was mostly friendly and efficient and the food was pretty darn good.  One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!  Big portions.  Huge step up from your regular fast food joints, $13.00 veggie combo, while it appears pricey, is actually pretty fair for the quality/quantity you get.  Call me a fan!~burgers ~4
-brx5K_-S5UEdm3aOP6lSA~DwD_FiTTffRFj1Xrjih5ww~This location has fallen out of favour.  Stopping in for a nice breakfast, there was not a lot to praise.  Starting with a cup of decaf, I was told they only serve instant decaf.  Strike one.  The 3 egg breakfast came with a mound of fried potatoes, that were throughly over salted.  Strike two.  Like many, I enjoy PB&J on my toast.  The waitress brought the jam, but no peanut butter.  Being allergen free was the excuse, but I don't buy it.  Wimpy's on Yonge in Aurora still serves peanut butter.  Strike three.  Back to the minors for you!~instant egg potatoes, peanut butter ~2
-brx5K_-S5UEdm3aOP6lSA~JHRX6G-ogcOpuGM9K5yEuA~The real greasy spoon diner concept. Fun place to pig out. Large portions and a reasonable price. Not for the diet or nutritionally concuss. Staff is very friendly and helpful. This is a family owned restaurant and it shows in the attitude. Try the liver and onions. They got it right.~liver and onions. ~5
-33BHZKxCiREa1cfa672OQ~m2OQ_isR0wQX6bwsiWMQ_A~We were the only table in the restaurant, a table of 6. We waited over an hour for the food. During this hour, each person sat with empty an empty glass, until someone walked over to the bar to find the only waitress in the place, to order refills. Eventually, we each received 1 refill.  Alas, the food arrived. A young man arrived with the waitress and set one plate down. When we asked him what dish that was he responded "I have no idea." It was the wrong dish. We were told the kitchen could redo the order but after waiting over an hour for the food, we just took what the young man brought. 5 out of 6 entrees arrived. Entrée #6, a burger - the waitress checked the kitchen and reported "The chef dropped your burger on the floor. He will have another one ready in 5 minutes." We had waited an hour, yet the chef would remake an entrée in 5 minutes? Or would he just pick it up off the floor... we wondered.  The "liver special" was so overcooked it was inedible. Leathery, no flavor and black as a hockey puck. The roasted potatoes, accompanying half the entrees, were firm and cold. The veggies, all cold. The "warm spinach salad", cold; and the spinach was wilted. The gravy accompanying the lamb chops was thick and solidified. The last entrée arrived, and exactly like the other burger entrée, the bacon was overcooked and the cheese was hard, as if it had been sitting for a while. Needless to say, most of the food went back to the kitchen. After waiting again, we walked through the restaurant to find the waitress to request the bill. When paying by card, we had to leave the seats and stand on the other side of the restaurant because that area did not receive reception. By the end of the evening, I must admit we were laughing. The entire experience was awful, so bad in fact we had to laugh. Upon arrival we wondered why the place was literally empty. By the time the evening was over, we knew exactly why. This is the last time we will ever go to Triple Crown.~burger - burger potatoes, spinach salad" spinach lamb burger bacon cheese ~1

The BBQ chicken pizza wasn't the kind I'm used to, but it was utterly fabulous. My friends had the hot wing, I'm not usually a hot wings person so I was just happy with my pizza and white zinfandel.

--R3uiY2dB43MpdwtG6jhQ~S8bHVqx4rmtFAS_0iJ0zzw~Experienced a body ecu failure in my 6 month old FRS series 10.  Unfortunately Toyota did not stock this part for my particular model.  They tried other computers from other more common models with no success but unfortunately mine was unique.  I was without my car for 2.5 months.  The service manager and my service adviser  did an amazing job of taking care of me.  They had no control of this issue but they took ownership of the problem and made sure I had a rental and kept me up-to-date with weekly phone calls.  DVNT has always treated me well but this was above and beyond what I could have expected.  Will definitely continue to buy cars from DVNT and have my vehicles serviced with them.~date ~5
--R3uiY2dB43MpdwtG6jhQ~SI88XNFSnxns1xQ2D7m4xw~I have owned nothing but Toyota Corolla's since I was 16, and all of them from Don Valley North Toyota.  I have always found the service advisors professional and upfront about costs and what is mandatory and what is optional.  I find that if you book for multiple things like snow tires and maintenance and drive clean your wait will be longer than quoted.  It's also a big and busy dealership - so it's more challenging for every car repair to be fast but there is shuttle service, free wifi, free coffee and even J-Town next door to spend some time while waiting.  The one thing I will say, is that I bring my car in for service as recommended and I have never had a major breakdown - only flat tires or battery failure, while friends with cars from other automakers and/or those who don't take their car to a dealership for service seem to have endless and costly car repairs.  Lastly, Don Valley is special because they bring mechanics from Japan where the cars are designed to train mechanics here in Canada, I think it makes them more knowledgeable and that's why I don't go to Downtown Toyota, even if it's closer.  Also, my one dealing with Downtown Toyota felt like endless upsell from service advisors that were nothing like those at Don Valley.~coffee ~5
--R3uiY2dB43MpdwtG6jhQ~C1KtRlBGj4loaZsd6BEs-g~I started coming here because of my service advisor, Marlon Lopez. Marlon gave outstanding service and REALLY took care of all his customers, and always was upfront and honest.  When he left Toyota on the Park to come to Don Valley North myself and like 20-30 other customers started coming here to find him and it's worth it.  You build relationships with him, just like your family doctor or dentist and when you have any trouble he will do a lot to help you out!!  Likes :  passion and dedication to customer service, upfront, integrity.  Dislikes : sometimes the service line up can be long and he's not in every weekend so call ahead to make arrangements.  Line ups are usual and typical in every service dealer but you get confortble chairs , free wifi to use and complimentary coffee and newspapers not to mention a free car wash after every service appointment !!  Overall come and see Marlon ... Many customers appreciate his customer service and he had many thank you cards and gifts from all us loyal customers !!  Steven  November 2013~coffee ~5
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~0rRe9z1ABkXH8S-24WH4Lw~My daughter and son in law introduced me to Caribou Coffee....I must say that I am an instant fan!!  I come from Maine and my daughter, also a Maineiac,  feel right at home here.  I do not know about some of the prior comments, I find that she an I are able to sit there for hours and talk with out being interrupted or otherwise bothered.  If you are gonna sit there and use their internet for hours and then get mad 'cause they want you to actually BUY something,  I think you ought to go somewhere else....and leave a spot for a paying customer - not just users/abusers of a priveledge offered to PATRONS.    GROW UP.  Now that I have spoke my mind,  I love this place and frequently order their coffees, snack bars, and miscellaneous stuff on line.  I bought a Keurig coffee machine from them....A match made in heaven  =)    And a fireplace Too!!~coffee.... instant coffee ~4
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~7tcTf4C6EF5mr7ZbERSCTQ~OK I have never been to a Caribou Coffee before in my life and considering that I practically live on soy lattes, I decided to check it out during my stay in the Cleveland area.  I am out here often for work and never really know where to go that will actually have soy milk.  Alas, I found this great little spot.  The employees were soooo friendly, I came back twice in one day.  Free wi-fi was very helpful in getting some work accomplished while enjoying my coffee.  Just ask the pleasant barista/counter person for the free card.   I will def be back again next time I am in the area.~coffee milk. coffee. ~5
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~K_6H6z21gOXJZsWwVg0w9Q~I guess I never go to Caribou because it's sorta lost among all the other cool places in Lakewood and Rocky River. I prefer other coffee to Caribou, but needed a change of scenery so I decided to try this one on Detroit Road.  It is severely bugging me how the people at Caribou act. They remind me of the Zoup people (see my review for that to understand what I mean). So chipper, yet they seem so insincere. It's okay if you don't give me a flashy smile and ask me if I'd like to partake of your special promotion using the same exact wording you used on the guy before me. I can see it in your eyes that you are embarrassed of yourself! Just be genuinely friendly, and the rest will work itself out. I promise. (However: if you're gonna get fired for not using a script to talk to me, well, then, carry on, because i wouldn't want you to lose your job.)  Coffee was just ok. I even got a cooler (honey almond) and it was really kind of revolting actually. And I don't need whipped cream on my coffee, and thanks for not even asking before you gave it to me. Oh well. I'm feeling kinda moody today; sorry that my Caribou review got the brunt of my attitude.~coffee coffee honey almond) coffee, ~2
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~TgYFRqsZnkjFWCQHlthTkQ~I figured I would write a review for Caribou as I was writing one for Phoenix across the street and I've been in both places a considerable amount on visits to town.  Although I tend to prefer Phoenix as having less of a yuppie-chain atmosphere, I'd say Caribou is a better stop if you're looking for a dessert-type coffee drink, i.e. something with hot chocolate, tons of whipped cream and sprinkles, as opposed to a more basic coffee, cappucino or tea.  Caribou also has a pretty extensive pastry selection.  All the stuff tastes decent; it is very sweet (if you're not into sweet then you probably want to go someplace else) and much, much better than Starbucks coffees and baked goods.  Better selection than Starbucks too.   I have eaten/ drunk inside this restaurant and also gotten drinks and muffins, etc.  to go. I have to say I prefer to take it home as it seems like there's an inordinate number of people, primarily 20-40 year old business types, who treat Caribou Lakewood like it's their own living room or their own office.  I don't mean that in the "hang out for a while, talk and meet people" vibe-sense that the Phoenix has going on, but more like the "buy a coffee and then don't leave for about 4 hours while you pound your computer and read the free newspapers" sense.   This may appeal to some, but when the restaurant is obviously very crowded (such as on nice weekend mornings) it would be good if people were considerate enough to leave within a reasonable period of time so others just coming in might have some access to a table.~coffee coffee, tea. coffee ~3
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~lq2jhRJjFEseORP7-OQ8DQ~The coffee is okay. Because I don't prefer coffee that has to come with its own insulin vial, maybe it's not the place for me. I prefer plain, rich, bitter coffee, and there bold pick always seems to be hit or miss. Not sure why the inconsistency, just an observation. Also at this particular location I have noticed A LOT of squatters. They never seem to leave...if they had some tents I would just chalk it up to like an occupy movement or something. In addition to this side note, another: it smells not of coffee in this establishment but of a whopper junior on a hot summer day. Can someone explain this to me?~coffee coffee coffee, coffee ~3
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~KDIPs7izcFSpJYUpv5qLAg~At the time I wrote my original review, Caribou was forcing people to enter in a code for the free Internet every 1.5 hours.  The charging bothered me on two levels.  One, it wasn't really "free" Internet.  It was Internet that required purchases at specifically timed intervals.  Where those not using wi-fi were able to "sit there for hours and talk without being interrupted or otherwise bothered," Internet users at Caribou didn't have that pleasure.  Sure, they might get up and purchase a $1.50 worth of Caribou products every 1.5 hours, but there was nobody holding them to that.  I'm guessing if somebody interrupted one of their discussions to ask them to purchase something, they would have found it to be a little odd, a little rude, and a little uncalled for.  In other words, we're all big enough to make those purchases on our own.  We don't need a timer running by our side.  Thus, there should be no separation between Internet-users and those just whiling away the hours in discussion.    Secondly, the 1.5 hours system never really worked.  At each Caribou, the workers would just hand you a stack of tickets with the codes.  They all seemed to find the mandatory purchase thing to be silly, and acted accordingly.  This was the way it was at all of the Caribou locations I visited.  Thankfully, Caribou has since done away with the mandatory purchase thing for Internet users.  With truly "free" wi-fi being offered near-everywhere nowadays, charging just doesn't make sense; especially for a business that thrives on computer users visiting their stores.  I'll continue to visit the many neighborhood Caribou locations.  Sure, it's corporate whore coffee, but the employees are pleasant, the chai rocks and the locations are bright and airy; always conducive to writing, reading and good conversation.~coffee, ~3
OHxQMmZnJ8HE7VzNfYMFFw~huxp_IecJd6Oc3lJ5v90Qg~Giving it 3 cause it's a chill place (but why not hop to the other side of the road to the Roots Cafe) but had two smoothies - grossness to the mostness   Tasted like that artificial flavored sugar powder from when your a kid. Both mine (mango-pom) and my wife's (strawberry-ban) came out red - I immediately knew there was a problem. Confirmed on the first sip.~smoothies - mango- ~2
4wqkn_yFq3YELR_VbNLBKA~WY_h_GT6gePmenD_4CSA_Q~OK, people. Time to hunker down and get real serious-like. There's no appropriate Yelp category for what the Hassle Free Clinic is - and that's a reproductive and sexual health clinic. This is THE place to go for STI and HIV testing, sexual health counselling, abortion referral, questions about pregnancy, birth control acquisition and the like.   It's a really great place to go if you're not comfortable talking to your family doctor about birth control or if you don't want to get on a ridiculous waiting list for a gynecologist. The staff is very open-minded, compassionate and knowledgeable. The clinic actually lives up to its name - it has been truly hassle free during each of my visits.  There are separate hours for men and women. STI testing is on a drop-in basis but HIV testing requires an appointment. You can only call to make an appointment during the hours for your particular gender. I've listed the women's clinic hours but there's a separate entry with the men's hours on it. This is a bit tricky if you want to go in to get tested with your new boyfriend (notice I wasn't gender neutral - we all know it's usually the dude who has to be coerced into getting an STD test, right??) but usually you can work it out that you get tested towards the end of the women's hours and they go at the beginning of men's hours. Go grab food at Salad King while you wait for the turnover.  All testing is FREE and no health card is required. You read that correctly. HIV testing can be anonymous if desired. There are two types of HIV tests and both are blood tests: one is the regular test, which is sent to the Ministry Of Health for assessment and ready in 7-10 days. You call to see if your results are ready (you're referred to by a number) and then go in a second time to get the results. Fun, but not nearly as fun as...  Rapid on-site testing! They've been doing this at the HFC since 2002. You fill out a sexual health questionnaire that assesses your risk for HIV in the first place, then they prick your finger with a needle, take the blood sample and test it for the presence of HIV antibodies. You get the results in 5-10 minutes, and if it's positive they follow up with a full blood test to double confirm.  You get a certification that you are HIV and STI free as of whatever date you were there when you leave - a nice little reference for you to show off. You know, on your fridge, or whatever.~salad date ~5
4wqkn_yFq3YELR_VbNLBKA~h4NY36EXa2uSBoGq-hJ_Uw~Hassle Free is a misnomer. I am a male and I go here for yearly HIV testing, and it is always a huge hassle to try to book an appointment. You have to call them exactly 2 weeks in advance of the date you wish to book your appointment. 13 days before, or 15 days before, out of luck, sorry. Ridiculous policies. Once you are at your coveted appointment that took you 2 months to try to book, you are given a 30 minute lecture-like information session about everything you did sexually. They ask you all sorts of invasive questions too. Sorry but I came for a simple HIV test not to answer 20 questions and be given information that I have known since grade 8. It is a waste of time and I have never been told anything I didn't know. Then when they finally give you the test, they make it all dramatic. They leave the room with the test and then come back several minutes later. Other places I have gone just stay there since you can pretty much tell what it is going to be within a couple minutes. Why create the unnecessary anxiety?  The only reason I go here is because it is one of the only places I know that does the HIV rapid test. However I challenge them to cut back on all the fuss and just administer the tests rather than turning it into a huge info session. Maybe if they did that, there would not be a 2 week wait to begin with.~date ~1

9d9xtTySep6IR2SLM0CnKA~Kvu69A2zhtYCOKyTF4U7jg~The Bethany Shop and Cafe is a pleasant and homely charity shop which also incorporates a cafe.  During the summer last year my friend and I spent about an hour and a half in here just raking through the heaps of wierd and wonderful things which they sell at dirt-cheap prices.  We came out with an enormous Union Jack and a big, thick rug for about £5.  These items were just nestled away in amongst old hoovers, dustbins, ornaments and even wardrobes!  It also holds a surprisingly large selection on books in varying conditions but which are sold consistently cheap.  These include anything from biographies of Princess Diana to First Wold War poetry.   The cafe serves a selection of cakes, sandwiches and the usual hot and cold drinks and seems to be a hit with the shop's older clientele.  Whether you're just passing or fancy getting something semi-new for just a few quid, The Bethany Shop and Cafe is definitely worth a look.~sandwiches ~4
9d9xtTySep6IR2SLM0CnKA~nr4HCP6tn4sj3xxxeatPMw~A charity shop and a cafe? What a novel idea!  This Bethany outlet is very spacious, with the usual charity shop offerings such as clothing and books. They also have enough room to store some furniture, which in my previous visit included some lovely antique oak wardrobes.  Aside from the neatly ordered layout, what makes this Bethany stand out from its counterparts is the cafe running down the side of the store. They sell homemade cakes, teas and light snacks so if you become too exhausted bargain hunting, you can take five without having to move to a neighbouring tea room.  A bit more magical than your average charity shop, Bethany gives me yet another excuse to drink tea - to have a brew for a good cause!~tea tea - ~4
CvP516pjOdcJJkaMjl8rPw~x-JL9R9fp9qg6moS3q2-kQ~This place is down right, nasty since the new management took over, I got my favorite dish that I have been getting for yrs ( beef w/broccoli), they changed the beef or something it was totally inedible didn't taste like or had the texture of beef, it was gummy mushy I threw the whole dinner away after 3 bites! I will never ever go to china kitchen 2 again, why not leave well enough alone this place was fantastic!!HOW sad they really don't deserve the one star that I gave.~beef beef beef, ~1
CvP516pjOdcJJkaMjl8rPw~mJsh2q-NtbANcxxyrQgPIA~The food is okay, it's the same old Chinese food. I ordered the generals chicken and the outside crust of each piece fell off. It was soggy, and it wasn't tossed in the sauce. Just placed on top of it. The chicken was great but the lack of effort to put it together messed the whole dish up. I will only order fried rice from now on.~chicken chicken fried rice ~2
CvP516pjOdcJJkaMjl8rPw~ue8nLOlaqk3wLHKN_Y3IyA~I've tried many Chinese food restaurants, but I always come back here because it's so amazing.  You get a massive amount of food for such a low price. Most combo meals are around $7 in price, and the portions are so big that you can easily eat one combo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  My favorite is the Sweet and Sour Chicken, but there are many good choices like Pepper Steak, Chinese Vegetables, and many others. I'm actually not afraid to try different meals here because they are usually so amazing.  As for the employees, Ken and his sister Brandy are both great. They will always greet you with a smile, and if you've been going there for as long as I have, they will already know what you're getting, and will have it done for you really fast. And they don't make you feel out of place like you do at some Chinese restaurants. Seriously, they're amazing!  And as a final endorsement, I have had my friend try out their food (who is Chinese and his family owns a restaurant), and he even admitted that the food at China Kitchen II was better than the food at his family's restaurant! And his family's restaurant is quite popular, so that's quite an endorsement!  Seriously, everyone should at least try China Kitchen II at least once and you'll find out why customers keep coming back.  Just keep in mind, they only take cash, which may be off-setting to those of you who like credit. This place is worth it though!~chicken, pepper steak ~5
CBwj5nbNxNcU-QJ8Z7oEsw~hVRMFxLTkgLgRS87U2GYwg~I have to credit Caz for introducing me to Lock Up Coffee, which is a fantastic new popup shop hidden away just off Broughton Street. I love what they represent: good people who know their coffee and want to spread their love of enjoying and exploring different coffees from different roasters and regions of the world!  Each week they choose a different roaster and bean to feature. This means that they focus on exploring something new each week, but it also means that there is just one type of coffee each week, either with or without milk.  Last week I stopped by with Caz to check this place out but I didn't have any coffee since I was already coffee-d out for the day and it was late in the afternoon. The place intrigued me, though, with its bare-bones minimalistic surroundings. It is basically a popup coffee stand and seats in a clean and tidy garage. The decorations and furniture are indeed sparce, but this is part of the whole ambiance here. I particuarly liked the 'loyalty card' which is an actual wooden door where you write your name with permanent marker and start a tally next to your name. I'm not sure if you actually get anything from the loyalty card, but then again just having your name on the door is something in itself. I also quite liked the dartboard.  Today after brunch in the area I brought Mason and Tanja to check out this new place since I thought they'd love it (and had persuaded them after going on about this cool popup coffee place. Today I had the 6oz coffee with milk (as did Mason) and the guy brewing them up for us was chatty and really friendly. He made adorable and different designs on both of our coffees, too. After taking my first sip, I knew this was good stuff! It was delicious, rich and just plain amazing.  Lock Up Coffee basically says 'here we are, we love what we do.' I love that they are quirky and different, and I do think they do a great job. Although they only offer minimalist coffee options, the quality of the beans and brews are superb and that does it for me. I will keep coming back to try the new brews each week when I can!  Do note that they are only open 10am - 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays, but will be open all week long during the festival. It's also cash only.~coffee, coffee coffee milk. coffee coffee- coffee coffee coffee milk ( coffee coffee ~5
CBwj5nbNxNcU-QJ8Z7oEsw~CF-n8UqagVNivp242V2BvQ~Pop up coffee shop & tea on the side.. Decorating's a bit sparse but the super friendly barista & fantastic coffee are well worth the visit.  Different bean & roaster every weekend, great for trying something new!~coffee tea coffee ~5
CBwj5nbNxNcU-QJ8Z7oEsw~We7dHRVr2KFabrHPD1_R3Q~A most welcome addition to the coffee scene in Edinburgh.  A weekend only pop up, Lock Up Coffee serves a new & exciting roast every week, so you are always going to taste something different from a variety of roasters. Owned & run by the crew from Freemans, they bring their expert knowledge to the Broughton area.  The blank space works well, helping to showcase the coffee and they are currently partnering with Pekoe Tea to offer some delicious blends to Edinburgh Tea lovers.  They have a fun & quirky reward system whereby you write your name on a board and get a free coffee after a certain amount of cups bought.  As with Freemans, the service is always super friendly.  A great place to go for a superb cup of joe while perusing the shops of Broughton street.~coffee coffee coffee tea tea coffee ~5
CBwj5nbNxNcU-QJ8Z7oEsw~bFATRC0-Mkx8mwXG7iaMoQ~Loved it - we sought out an independent, hole-in-the-wall, and this place is a weekend only joint stationed in a garage.  Super nice barista and good coffee.  Highly recommended.~coffee. ~5
CBwj5nbNxNcU-QJ8Z7oEsw~Q5HxhpouOQV02yOedwht7A~Check out this place if you like coffee - it's a must! Bear in mind they are only open sat And Sundays 10-6 - maybe open weekdays during festival? Lovely beans from a roastery that's in Scotland this week.  The beans change every week, so a different tasty coffee everytime you go!  Please note it does not have a toilet as it's set up in a garage.~coffee - coffee ~5

B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~XEx5biXlcaD9G9RAxxeDXA~The other reviews on here had kept me from trying this place for a while, so I figured I'd give in and give it a run. I ordered the club, a poutine and a drink.  First off, this place gets an extra star. I placed my order online with just-eat.ca and within 10 minutes of sending off my order and paying for it, I got a call from the restaurant to make sure that I was okay with the toppings that were included and that it was ready whenever I was (early btw). The website didn't offer a toppings option, but I thought it was great that they called to make sure I'd be happy with what I got. I also asked for extra mayo on the side in my online order and I got it - an entire container :) They also packaged my cold pop separately from the hot food and in its own paper bag to keep it from making everything else cold. The little things!!  The good: the sandwich was on a really nice fresh kaiser bun, two pieces of nice, thin chicken, a good amount of bacon and fresh toppings (tomato, lettuce, etc). The poutine was nice and cheesy. Both of them were great portion sizes (I wasnt able to finish either).  The bad: While I like cheese on a club, it was processed and there was a bit too much of it. It probably would have been better without it. The gravy was really lumpy and thin and the fries could have been cooked longer.  Overall, not a fantastic meal, but I'll be sure to try them out again when I feel like a gyro or caesar, two of the things recommended in other reviews. The fact that its around the corner is good and that the staff was really nice when I came in is a plus too.~sandwich chicken, bacon tomato, lettuce, cheese fries ~4
B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~zcboCk1OtELQU9emJTCDXg~Firstly, this place deliveries VERY late, so you have to give them some credit for that.  At first glance though if you go in person, is that this place is the most unimpressive.... BUT, I have gotten to know some of the food there well.  Their gyro is absolutely one of my favourites in the city.  It's kinda neither of a Greek style, nor a Middle East style.  I just love that the gyro slices they make, are afterwards grilled on a flame grill, before being wrapped with onion, tomato, and tzatziki.  My mouth waters just remembering it.  Anther thing going for this place... CHEAP.  One of the cheapest places I order from.  The only complaint I have with them sometimes is when I order, the guys that delivery the food for them can be total fucking knobs.  EI, confusion at the door, can't buzz in, I go to meet them downstairs, and in the meantime, they leave the lobby, so I'm chasing them around. Despite all that, I shamelessly continue to order from them though.~onion, tomato, ~4
B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~Y1naRjoqONBARmG-HUUL3A~I went to Toronto to visit a homie and it got super late.  I went to the front desk of his building and talked to a smooth Indian guy who told me that Sizzlers was the titts.  I had to believe him after all, he was an Indian.  So I walked down the street and scoped this place.  I ordered the philly steak.  They made it FRESH and hot right there.  They put some ill mushrooms in it and peppers and whatnot and spiced it up for me.  My mouth waters just thinking about it right now.  It was so correct!  There was a girl with a super thick ass in there waiting on some snacks, I was trying to spit game to her and show her my award winning break dancer moves.  She wasn't interested but the dudes behind the counter didn't call the cops on me so they get an extra star for that.    Don't believe the haters, this place is 2 legit 2 quit.  Order the philly steak spicy and while you wait you can go outside and punch out a couple of bums down the street in the Toronto equivalent of Times Square for asking you for change.  Do I LOOK like I have SPARE CHANGE?  I ONLY USE CREDIT CARDS SON!!!~steak. mushrooms steak ~4
B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~A0QD8w6wwekzZG1qD5wy_A~Been going here since it was called Steak Out...proper..the hamburger is huge, the portion of fries is huge...but if ur serious get the bbq chicken as they actually put it on a grill...never had to worry about the delivery guys as I live across the street from the joint...its a diner style spot but they make a proper salad~steak hamburger fries bbq chicken ~3
B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~7r5MucsKxqOffGrIHroUsg~One of the best late night destinations in the area, Sizzlers is open until 5am, making it an instant favourite for night owls and people stumbling home after a night of drinking.  Their burgers are delicious, but my favourite would have to be the chicken Caesar that they serve.  When you walk in, it looks a bit like a makeshift operation with the scattered chairs in the seating area in the back, but it really isn't.  These guys have been running this place for years and really seem to have their work down to a science.  Whether you're hammered, tipsy, or not, this place always serves you some greasy goodness that's sure to satisfy whatever ails you.~instant burgers chicken ~3
B_SA4Ulz2_pLpbS8qHZkwA~M0Hgcpkd5MxOaxLB3ELhXA~The food is bad. There's really not much more to say than that.  I ordered some food for delivery: a poutine, a burger, a greek salad, and garlic bread. It arrived about an hour later, cold and soggy. The poutine was okay but the rest of the food was abysmal. The burger was hard as a rock, the garlic bread was little more than a burger bun and the lettuce was so brown and wilted than it was inedible. I will say though, what little I had of the dressing tasted quite good and the toppings were plentiful. If only the lettuce had not appeared to be about a week past its prime, it would have been pretty good. This place's only saving grace is that I can tell this food would be damn delicious while piss drunk, and they're open till 5 am which definitely caters to that crowd. They get an extra star for that.~burger, salad, garlic burger garlic burger lettuce brown lettuce ~2
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~qVMbohKtQFy7pLhX-7coTQ~I've been here a few times so far, and quite pleased with it!  The coffee is very good, and I had a turkey wrap for lunch.  That was also quite good.  A cute little setting attached to a clinic.  It can be easy to miss as you drive by in Stoughton, if you don't keep your eyes peeled.  Just head into the clinic and park in the clinic lot, the cafe is right there.~coffee ~4
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~Nxa1gNohg8KlZV-xDmrhEA~My dad's girlfriend and I went here to chitchat and get to know each other better and it was a great place to do just that.   It is your average coffee shop but what makes this one different is they actually have made in house food that is TASTY! I didn't order anything too complicated, but as we were there talking, I'd hear people have these really cool nifty specialty drinks they wanted and they'd customize the drink to the person's standard--everyone seemed very happy.  They do have wifi.~coffee ~4
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~J0MDulJ_q7ENx99gR0RUow~I have been here twice. Both times my sister and I ordered coffee drinks. I ordered an iced latte and she had a flavored coffee. Both were perfect. Exactly the way we ordered. No complaints. The barista was very friendly, helpful and funny.~coffee coffee. ~5
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~yVMVgJQMFeRo5XhmhM8NBw~Just an FYI ... It is no longer TRUE coffee. The new name is Malabar Coffee & Tea. I picked up a few day old scones for Sunday morning and they were pretty darned good. The fresh baked goods looked unusually over baked, almost black edges.   I did not get any coffee drinks today, maybe another time.~coffee. coffee & tea. coffee ~3
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~CD0nCv64mJSD6VL5_T81lg~I travel a LOT for my job. Something that keeps me sane is a great coffee at cool coffee shops. Normally I go for a standard black house coffee, but today I wanted a mocha and a cookie. This place delivered an excellent mocha and my chocolate chunk cookie was perfect, IMO. I don't think I'll be back to Stroughton anytime soon, but I definitely recommend this place. It's a gem for good coffee drinks :)~coffee coffee coffee, coffee ~5
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~FRtXYsB72QhZzJLjizlnHw~***One thing to note is the phone number on yelp is wrong (as of today) the correct number is 608-873-1600.***  One of my favorite places in Stoughton PLUS they have almond milk! Which makes my wife happy.  Super friendly employees and a nice quiet seating area if you want to read the paper or get some work done.~almond milk! ~5
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~vTJppRjfUzbkTUGemqOnig~Pro: Best coffee in Stoughton. Really, it's awesome. They do a great latte. Con: It's in a weird location on the way out of town, connected with a health clinic / exercise club. Parking can be tough if there is a youth basketball tournament or something. Pro: In winter, the fireplace is great. They leave it on throughout the day. Con: The internet service really and truly sucks. Don't bother going if you need to work on the internet. You could log onto the clinic's web service, but that signal's pretty bad too. In all, it's a great place for a coffee if you want to hang out and chat with friends when the clinic isn't busy.~coffee coffee ~3
3JjLHp_FlUYez2TipIwffA~0F3DSR7ZwIEqVOLZVMrw_Q~I really enjoy this place. The atmosphere is clean and fresh. The downside is it is a little difficult to get to and it's easily missed if you don't know it is there. The sandwiches and coffee are very tasty and the service is friendly and fast.~sandwiches coffee ~5
8xV7kOdubzx2tPIgwDtaGQ~WG1dPQK2agZZC34cKPldXQ~This is a really nice shop in the neighbourhood for anyone that owns an Apple product. Don't be fooled by the store's small size as you'll most likely find what you were looking for in here.   To top it off the guys working here are really nice and helpful.~apple ~5
8xV7kOdubzx2tPIgwDtaGQ~9mjAmSK2jbeMgOophwUNIA~Smart staff, great service, and an impressive selection for a small shop.  I consistently get excellent service and good advice here. They are a little quick to suggest I buy this and that, but they are a store, and that's their job.  I've had great experiences with trade-ins here as well. They offer a respectable amount for used Apple products.  I haven't attended any of their workshops, but I hear good things.  A great apple store.~apple apple ~5
8xV7kOdubzx2tPIgwDtaGQ~2PjelJYnWzBdU96j4QI18w~I am AMAZED and AGOG that this is BeachMac's first review! MacPeeps in the MacBeach, check this place out!  Staff are wonderful - friendly, funny, and - wow - they know Macs. Both of the employees I met were young males (appropriately and adorably geeky), and were absolutely lovely. They were patient with my ignorance (this is my very first Mac, and it's a hand-me-down), and listened to every single thing I said. LOVE THAT.  It's a cute little corner shop on East Queen East (does anyone else say that?) between Woodbine & Victoria Park. It's small, but efficient. Spacious for its "front-of-house" needs. They sell everything Mac-ish... Sometimes (if the door at the rear swings open) you can catch a glimpse of the MacFairies working at the back... it's all very secret and special.  Street parking, and there are always spots available (SCORE!)  I took in two MacBooks - one mine and one for a friend. The friend needed upgrades to everything, and I had an odd problem with CAPSLOCK and Shift.  Everyone on the Apple Support online forums said my issue was related to an operating system upgrade bug... NOPE! It was just the keyboard and housing needing to be replaced.  They send an email every day it's in the shop to let you know what's going on, as well as an email when it's ready!  My MacBook was ready in two days, the other in five. Pretty darn MacAwesome.  And - LISTEN - when they hand you a bill from a computer bought  in 2006 with a $0 bill... I mean, just come on. I love it.~apple ~5
8xV7kOdubzx2tPIgwDtaGQ~EVi6V-cur1cySBmvSvt8ww~Spilled lovely wine all over my laptop.  They were very open and communicative about the price and what the possible outcomes may be, possible further damages, cost, etc.  Turn-around time was excellent.  Price was the same as any other Apple product repair would be, will go back the next time I spill booze on an iThing.~apple ~4
8xV7kOdubzx2tPIgwDtaGQ~SF6XWr9Wp1qeqiJ0TSYGww~Lars the Apple technician at BeachMac is terrific: honest, hard-working, and a professional. He called me the day after I dropped off my constantly-stalling laptop to give me a technical diagnosis, a cost estimate of various options, and his final recommendation (install a solid state drive and upgrade my operating system).   He explained that while my laptop could use more RAM and a new battery and he'd happily install both, neither are urgently needed. So I passed on both, and saved ~$300.   Most importantly, my laptop is running beautifully again.~apple ~4
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~eLlG_PkRVxNVH4NB-F_2jw~First of all, Happy New Year. sorry for the MIA but I was scouring Spain and have returned to Toronto in search of some delicious eats as good as the ones I had there.  Enough with the pleasantries.. I finally had the opportunity for a ladies dinner at The Rosebud. I had heard so many amazing things about this place that I was really pumped to go. Although it was a quiet wednesday night I still had high hopes for the service / food.  Service -Remarkable. The man who served us, (I believe was the manager) was very sweet. Very open and helpful and really took an interest in us as patrons and as people. He could very well be the only reason I would return to this restaurant.  Atmosphere -quaint. I love that amidst the chaos of Queen street, this intimate restaurant exists. With only a handful of tables, it really brings back the feel that I have missed since La Palette closed down in Kensington  Food. This is where this review goes off the rails. I tried their prix fixe and I think that was a mistake. The mussels were bad (no flavour and I actually got a BAD one), The steak was nothing to write home about and the wine selection was a bit sparse. One thing that I can say that I enjoyed thoroughly was the dessert. Our server allowed us to try all three that were on the the menu this evening. My favourite was the Creme Caramel. Delish.  I will give this restaurant a second shot however as it's my hope that the poor food service was due to a slow night. (perhaps on a busier evening it will wow me a bit more). Maybe I just really want to like this place... maybe I'm just a sucker for a cozy environment.~steak caramel. ~2
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~blpwCA6cAKWdE_QXcnvkEg~I first heard about this place after landing at Queen and Broadview and, having to wait for a bit for my friends to arrive, popped into a drink at the Citizen (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-citizen-toronto), a very cool retro-50s style restaurant.  In talking with the bar staff they told me about their sister restaurant, Rosebud.  It wasn't until the next day that I walked by Rosebud in the heart of Queen West and then smacked my head as to why they called it that (It's a "Citizen Kane" reference and you too should be ashamed for not seeing it).  When I tried Rosebud, we showed up unannounced and unreserved and took the last table in the place.  A nice wine list and a breadth of great-looking Italian dishes are the fare.  For starters, we took the warmed black olives.  It sounds simple and they are simply delicious.  The secondi and pastas that we split were, well, great.  Gnocchi, which I don't typically go for, tasted spectacular and the steak was tender, tasty, and bloody the way a rare steak should be.  The fact that both Citizen and Rosebud share the same chef tells you that you're probably assured the same quality dishes from either kitchen.  You'd think that the chef'd get tired from running between the two.~gnocchi, steak steak ~5
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~frSG3HVm6VM66hlsNz3qcg~We came to Rosebud last night after an unsuccessful attempt to get a table at Czehoski jwhich was packed (just before 7 pm) and the few vacant tables were reserved..... Note to self, make a reservation for Czehoski for a Saturday night.  We walked into Rosebud which was completely EMPTY!!!  First clue!  Supposedly the restaurant was completely reserved in the next half hour or so.  But the waitress was able to find a table for 2, so down we sat.  She explained the specials (food and wine) and the menu itself looked good.  Then we looked at the wine list.  Quite extensive white wine selection in a variety of price ranges.  The red however was quite short and VERY expensive with the majority of wines in the $100 range.  NOT!  We got the scoop from the waitress..... seems the owner is busy with other projects and his wife is pregnant.  And there's no manager at the restaurant.... so no one's ordering wine.  OR as we contemplated later.... is it that cash flow is so bad, they can't purchase wine???  The waitress offered us a bottle of wine at a discount, but at this point we were wondering if the owner/manager was ignoring the wine, were they also ignoring the food?  And the waitress also mentioned she'd only been there 2 weeks.... so are they also ignoring the restaurant and the staff are clueing in they may be working on a sinking ship?  So, we decided to cut our losses and leave.  Too bad really, as this was supposed to be a great restaurant at one time.~white ~1
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~5-3IK9DImRJ8j3FxhHabFw~Ass ass ass. I can't believe they feel justified charging $35 (on a summerlicious menu no less) for such boring food. I had the mussel appetizer. Mussels were bloated/exploded in some kind of boring tomato sauce. Main course was some boring salmon sitting on top of an equally boring vegetable medley. There was no flavour to be had ANYWHERE. I wanted to stab a fork into my eye. The creme brule was pretty good but I'm not sure I've ever had a creme brule I didn't like. My date's rhubarb cobbler was pretty delicious.  The atmosphere in the place was equally uninspired. I liked the painting of the dog with the cone collar though.~tomato salmon date rhubarb ~2
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~K8Z8PiAljWthJSj_4SueaA~I must have walked by this place more than a dozen times but I never saw it.  Some things are kept secret from you by the universe until you are ready for them.  I must be ready for Rosebud. I love the decor:  oldy-worldy wood, stained glass etc.  But what about the food?  Well, the menu changes all the time so what I review today probably won't be there when you go.  There were no mussels, no gnocchi and no rhubarb cobbler.  In fact, the menu was not Italian at all but Brit inspired (complete with minted peas and creamed corn...I recommend both).  There were deviled eggs (perfect with all gin drinks) and salmon cakes for starters. And my main was a bacon wrapped Halibut with a fried egg.  My friends had Lamb Faggots with Deviled Kidneys which may not be everyones cup of tea but if you are a fan of offal then you would be in heaven.   Our server was top shelf, kept on top of our drinks, knew the menu very well and the chef came out to make sure everyone was enjoying their food.  This is what I like in a resto. Oh, and the desserts were divine:  Potted lemon curd, burnt cream and chocolate pate...I'm drooling again thinking about it all.~gnocchi rhubarb peas creamed corn ~5
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~VqBhlAbpBnyAEcgig8m3wA~After a failed experience at another restaurant down the road, we walked into Rosebud at 8:15 with no reservation.  There were two servers, and the female waitress set us up even though it was practically full.  Call ahead for reservations Fri and Sat nights!  The menu is always changing. Both the servers were way too busy, but apparently it one the guy's first day on the job!  So, it took a while, but we finally ordered drinks and food.  Highlights:  Mussels in a cream sauce. This is the creamiest sauce I've ever seen, and the other part is the grilled bread served on the side that soaks up said cream sauce like a sponge! So good.  Fries that come with the lobster.  Areas for improvement:  Lobster was slightly soft, ?overcooked? The vegetarian risotto was made with pearl-like buds of rice/barley. It was too dark to tell, but I think it could have used something else. Lots of hazelnuts, celeriac, and pear, but still it didn't quite come together.  We needed to head out before dessert, but they looked delicious on the menu.  I totally didn't mind the slow service, but I think it was just that night, too.  I'll be back for the dark candle-lit environment, and grilled bread in mussel juice.~fries risotto pear, ~3
EKnU3om0PXGdkWfGnTM9Zw~WT8QhRJzJ-mHcZLz1TrCfg~I work steps away from Rosebud and after 5 years decided to finally step inside.  Have been there twice in less than a month, my new fav local restaurant!  They are offering a $20 price fix 3 course meal, everyone I have gone with has had minimal complaints (the first time my friend said his duck was dry and last time someone didn't love the creme caramel).   The service isn't super fast but it's a small place and I can't see how they could possibly squeeze another staff member in there, just 2 working the front of the house works and they are very attentive.  It's been busy both times I have been there (once with no reservation and once with) and last time Neve Campbell was sitting at the table next to us.~caramel) ~4
FvY_8lI18lgzkajJoWOprg~R8pYU7WgAXL6N9wKLalXFA~I've been here twice and don't think I'll be back a third time unless by force. Both times I've gotten slow service from the bartenders despite the bar being nearly empty. The regular clientele at the bar are creepy old men who spent the entire duration of my visit staring at me and my group. I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing a date here. The drinks were okay, the place was relatively clean, but with all the great bars on the Euclid/Cleveland border, there really isn't any reason to come here. Aside from being here for a million years, there's nothing that makes BGs unique.~date ~3
6QJgbrWvoXHioEqg3SD5CA~cAjgqNLpmM9kCKRVN911kQ~We love coming to this fair every year, and yes of course everything is overpriced but the nostalgia of the fair and all that it entails excites my son. I must admit I love this particular fair for a totally different reason......the grilled corn on the cob, which is reason enough for me to attend:-)~corn ~4
6QJgbrWvoXHioEqg3SD5CA~ffZLwAXxvXWvPmzJIqrPDw~Geeze, I can't remember the last time I've been to a county fair. They are still as awesome as I remember...plenty of games and rides to keep adults and children entertained for hours. I had a fabulous time!   But I'm dedicating this review to what I consider to be the best part of the fair....Funnel Cakes. Yep. That's no a typo I meant that fried doughy goodness is one of the main reasons I went to the fair....don't judge me!    I'm going to put it to you like this whoever created the funnel cake is a genius! I mean fried dough is already awesome but top it with powder sugar and it's nothing shy of a piece of heaven on a plate. Yum. My only regret...I should have gotten two...haha  Yep. Totally coming back again! It's definitely worth a visit.~cake ~4
6QJgbrWvoXHioEqg3SD5CA~9Qj86rHtdwM9HlnjzXRuVQ~Where else can you watch racing pigs, feed a camel, and eat fried oreos, corn dogs, and turkey legs.   KC & I decided to head to the fair. We arrived around 1:30 on Saturday afternoon. It took about 45 minutes just to pull into the fair grounds parking lot. WHOA! So busy... The traffic situation was a bit off-putting and they could have done a better job to manage the traffic. We got lucky and got to park in the first parking lot (parking is free). Admission was free from 1-3pm that day but is usually $7 for adults. Check their website as they offer different gate specials.  There was plenty to see and do for people of all ages. I especially enjoyed seeing all the animals and the feeding zoo. We didn't eat anything, as we were saving our appetites for the Greek fest, but there were plenty of fried, fair options. Funnel cakes, corn dogs, spiral cut potatoes, turkey legs, fried candy bars, roasted corn... I was tempted to fill my face with fair food but I exercised will power.  The midway area had lots of rides and games. It was busy but the lines weren't bad and traffic flowed pretty well.  The highlight of the visit, Robinson's Racing Pigs & Paddling Porkers!! Yes, racing and swimming pigs... Loved them! Go early to get a good seat.   A few tips for maximum enjoyment...  Cash only - Bring cash with you. You'll need it for everything! There are ATMs onsite but you can save yourself from extra fees if you plan ahead.   Don't forget sunscreen - The exhibit halls are in air conditioned buildings which was really nice on the hot day, but the pig racing and midway are outside.   Don't play the ping pong goldfish game - It may seem fun to have a goldfish but it's not... It's really just cruel and inhumane. Go win a stuffed animal instead.~corn corn potatoes, corn... ~4
6QJgbrWvoXHioEqg3SD5CA~0ivfgYX8fYijgHzfNq_sGA~I had the opportunity to go to Cabarrus County Fair this year and I must say that over all we had very good experience. I took my daughter and my niece and they had best time. Both of them wants to go back again next year.   I decided to go to the fair in the afternoon because I knew that by the evening time, the whole place will be pack and every single rides will have huge lines to get in. So we enter the parking lot and first parking lot was already full. We had to park in the back. We walked straight up to the gate we were lucky enough to be the second on the window to pay for entry fee.   Once we got in, we decided to use the bathroom before hand that way it's easier to hop on rides one after another. Than, we headed straight to the ticket booth where we either buy the wrist band if we want to ride all/most of the ride or we can buy tickets. Next, we decided to scan through the whole fair to make sure which rides we wanted to get on and started going one after another.   The whole fair was very well planned, all the security were in right place. Ticket booths were on multiple locations and all the food/drink stalls were almost everywhere. The other thing I really liked was the fact that the toddler rides were all put together (near by) so it was easy to get all small kids ride done in one area before you get on the big boys. They even had lot of other games kids can play in the middle section but those games required cash meaning they were not included in the whole wrist band pass. I think there were few selected rides as well which required cash and they were not taking tickets or wrist band.   We ran out of cash and I had to use ATM to get more cash, I remembered seeing cashpoint in the parking lot so I asked the security folks at the gate if they could let me go to the ATM and let me back in. I had to make sure otherwise I would have to pay the entrance fee again. Those two ladies were kind enough to let us go. By the time we came back, the ladies we had talk to were gone so quickly I scanned the parking lot and we were able to spot them. We called them up to talk to the security folks at the gate for re-entry.   We went back inside with extra cash which we spent well on the games which were in the middle row. They also had pretty good lemonade, I think it was bit too pricy but we expected at these type of festivity.   All in all, I would defiantly recommend it for kids, adults and I think it's even good spot for a date!~date! ~5
3M7MWfMh5RSoASV23-6hEw~1rNVnb1ixFCwLMIwpz8MNQ~Tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, those aren't the things that you're going to find at Mr Amigos. Wait what? Yup. This restaurant is run by Asians offering French food with a bit of their own touch. The food might not be the most authentic but their food will certainly bring you back.   Starting with the service, pretty standard except for one time where we were served by a little kid. He was trying to be too polite and things got quickly awkward in a certain way. Regardless of that, the food is carefully cooked. I was surprised at how tender most of the meats were. The cook certainly has talent and he isn't afraid to show it.   Mrs. Amigos has to be among the best restaurants in Brossard in my opinion. If you live nearby and haven't been there, do yourself a favor and treat yourself a meal at Mrs. Amigos.~tacos, burritos, quesadillas, ~4
-LyGT6bztmvWd3_pa93YDg~fJIG8S6GnhZUPFBst0nT5g~Good but far from Great.  Not sure if it's the Persian style but the food here just doesnt compare to my usual middle eastern eateries.  On the plus side the Hummus is quite possibly the BEST HUMMUS i've ever had. If i could i would buy a 16oz drink cup size of it and suck it through a straw.  The number 13 Shredded Beef and Lamb specialty plate is reasonably priced at 8.99, one of the few lamb dishes to remain the same cost from the to go menu to the main board.   On the side you get a small mixed green salad, a wedge of lemon, a glop of hummus (soo good..), a dolmeh, a small container of yogurt with cucumber sauce, and your...i guess it was a wrap.   The dolmeh was good but when paired with the yogurt sauce whoa that was something.   The wrap itself left something to be desired. I did enjoy the taftoon bread, it had a nice freshness to it and was different from the pita i'm used to. The meat was seasoned a little too well. Near the end of my meal i could hardly recall if there was any lamb in it seeing as the spices were so heavy it masked any individual taste of the meat itself. What little hummus and cucumber yogurt i had left were thrown on the wrap and it did improve the taste. Toward the end i reached for a bottle of franks red hot to liven things up a bit.   Also ordered a Lamb & Beef Gyro. I missed the lunch special by an hour so instead of 3.99 for gyro only i had to pay the standard price for the entire meal. Not really a problem.  Ali at Kebab Korner has spoiled me. Even when he tried to singe my taste buds by making his famous super gyro 'burn my ass' (his actual words to his staff "one super gyro, super spicy! BURN HIS ASS!!') with it's level of spiciness it just made me want more.  This gyro is extremely mellow, the meat was a bit dry and inside covered with yogurt cucumber sauce. It was good but it to me it just tasted shallow and empty compared to Kebab Korner.  Being considerably closer than Kebab Korner i might consider coming back a few time to take advantage of the lunch specials.~beef lamb lamb salad, lemon, cucumber pita lamb cucumber lamb & beef cucumber ~3

-LyGT6bztmvWd3_pa93YDg~et9KZgaWvf8ZmERTBSj4Jg~Flame Kabob is en fuego!!  The new Spring Valley location of Flame Kabob doesn't disappoint.  The interior is outfitted in brick, lusciously hand-painted ethereal wisps of detail, and a few beautiful oil paintings in regal brass frames.  It's bright, clean, and refreshing, much like the flavors you'll find in the authentic Persian cuisine.  I went with the Schawarma (beef and lamb).  It came wrapped in a wonderful Taftoon Bread (Persian pita, but better)  The bread was rolled out from the dough, and cooked in a clay oven right before my eyes.  Cue the 70's porn music...(bow-chicka-bow-wow!)    Also accompanying this huge Persian pleasure feast was some tomato, seasoned onion, lettuce, Tahini, fresh hummus, and dolmeh.  Dolmeh is Persian Dolmades for those of you familiar with Greek food.  It is a grape leaves stuffed with rice, onion, oil, saffron, and other fantastic flavors I couldn't figure out.  I finished this one, and immediately regretted not ordering more.  It was as satisfying as pizza rolls were when you were 12, or pizza rolls now if you're a kid at heart.    The schawarma itself was light in flavor, yet filling.  I had trouble finishing the meal and I was starving.  Notes of lemon, good olive oil, and the lamb and beef danced around beautifully with each bite I took.  I tried it with both the hummus and the tahini, but honestly, neither were needed, the flavor profile was perfect.  I would recommend ordering an extra side of the Taftoon Bread and dip your face off (nicholas cage movie reference anyone?)    This is a family run vacation from the greasy, typical, and always disappointing.  I feel bad even using these words in the review, this place is great and you need to get your Perzh-on!~kabob kabob beef lamb) pita, tomato, onion, lettuce, grape leaves onion, pizza pizza lemon, olive lamb beef ~4
-LyGT6bztmvWd3_pa93YDg~DjbWEWx5JCNGFmSEYTZVCw~The food here is pretty delicious.  We got a beef kabob, and a chicken kabob this time, and they were both awesome.  Very juicy, and flavorful  The fresh flat bread they make there is really good as well. The interior is nice, and clean, and the service is great.  My only complaint with Flame Kabob used to be that their prices were a bit high, but that's not as much of an issue anymore.  They have $3.99 lunch specials on weekdays 11-3, and that's pretty damn reasonable.~beef kabob, chicken kabob kabob ~4
-LyGT6bztmvWd3_pa93YDg~1a7XeavU9JRwJDOq6UDu_A~Got a to-go order today. I got the #4, Tenderloin Beef Shish Kabob. The kabob was flavorful and really hit the spot. The food was great! The food is also halal (muslim kosher).   Awesome that they have a location on West Side of town now.   The interior is immaculate and the food prep area is set up so that you can watch what is going on.   They are offering a coupon for a free kabob (ground beef only ) with the purchase of any entree. The coupon expires on 4/30/2011 is is for dine in only.   Will definitely be frequenting this place on an on-going basis.~beef kabob. kabob kabob ( beef ~4

I've also started to discuss signage and vehicle wraps with him.  I've been very impressed with their ability to not only design but complete the work.  They are very personable, professional and provide a great level of service.  I recommend them highly for your print, advertising, signage, and vehicle wrap needs.  Thank you AZCA!~wraps ~5

We didn't get everything we ordered, and what we did get the Chicken and Fish were way over cooked and tasted like yesterday's left overs,  lucky if you got a full small hand full of fries which were also nasty!!! We live a good 20 minutes away from this location, which unfortunately is the closest to us...we'll never go back again!!!

0s61pp0hAGHU2eWBogmayg~02Wmxl31X_89edinLSVckQ~This is by far my favorite place to stay in Montreal.  It is an absolutely unique and charming B&B that serves some of the best breakfast food I've ever had.  It's located two blocks off of Sainte-Catherine, so you are right next to one of the larger touristy areas without having to worry about being kept up all night due to the drunken revelry taking place on said touristy areas.  The rooms are color themed (personally I love the white room as it has a hot tub that is at least as big as my queen-sized bed, as well as a really nice porch) and the place is crawling with art.  In addition to this, they also have free wi-fi, and the last time I went, our room actually came -with- a computer to utilize said wi-fi.  Seriously, if you are willing to spend a little more, this is absolutely one of the best B&Bs you will find anywhere. The staff is awesome, the rooms are awesome, the breakfasts are beyond reproach.    I wish I could live there.~white ~5
0s61pp0hAGHU2eWBogmayg~Gl8aOPN1-L1q9iSctwZu2w~I've never been to a B&B before, but this experience made me want to go to one every time I travel.  Our hostess was hilarious (although I could easily see someone taking offense to her sense of humor) and made an amazing breakfast.    Our room was more beautiful than I could have imagined.  The pictures on the website give only a tiny glimpse to the beauty of the design! We were in the Blue room and we had a large sleigh bed with comfy blankets and pillows, a wall mounted CD stereo, a wall mounted television with built-in DVD player, a phone with directory, a mini-fridge with bottled water, a HUGE bathtub big enough for two, and our own fireplace.  They gave us one log for the fireplace, which was plenty for the night we were there. I think if you want more its like 5 bucks or something. Parking was scarce and we had to park in the back for an additional charge a night.   In the living room area there is a shelf full of DVDs, CDs and games to borrow.  The hostess also helped us find a place to order pizza, gave us directions to a store to get some sodas, and answered all of Chris' political questions: P    I didn't pay (thank you, dearest), but it's down one star for being a tad expensive.~pizza ~4
0s61pp0hAGHU2eWBogmayg~AmpY5oynpDbPatSFhA1PvA~Maybe it was a blessing in disguise:  I arrived yesterday and tried to call to see when my room would be ready - phone goes straight to voicemail and the mailbox is full so I can't leave a message.   I arrived at the b&b exactly at check-in time stated in the email I received and no one answered the door after repeated rings of the bell and knocks on the window. I waited outside for over an hour hoping someone would arrive. No one ever did, and it was getting very hot outside so I left.   I am currently staying at another hotel now and still have not heard from anyone at Petit Prince- either to ask why I haven't checked in or in response to the many emails I have sent them requesting immediate response. The phone is still full and there is no other number to call. And they already charged me for my first night!   ---  Update: THE OWNER WENT ON VACATION! Thanks for totally forgetting that you had a booking, not leaving a message on your voicemail, and causing me to spend a fortune on another hotel last-minute since every other hotel was fully booked. Still no response in any way.   Depending on how all of this is resolved, I'll be posting more on this later.~bell ~1

0sLskWuecHYjn3CZfn8qTw~sMnCXysgSvoVIOWhJwHg1g~The flavour of the foamed milk atop the cappuccino resembles what I imagine styrofoam would taste like. After mixing the foam to combine it into the drink, it was not as styrofoam-like. I have not tried anything else here but will not be purchasing their cappuccino again unless the company reformulates.~milk ~1
0sLskWuecHYjn3CZfn8qTw~FEj0LtGgJElnSWOPhwBBJw~Timothy's World Coffee is located at the lower level right outside of Walmart in Scarborough Town Centre.  Great place to meet up with your friends or people watching (I am not sure if the people here are too interesting though).  Pretty spacious with plenty of seating.  The most important is the WIFI sign always so strong and stable, the best hotspot in the Mall!~coffee ~3

The bottle of apple juice is exactly the same size as the smaller ones in the dollar store. It wasn't organic or anything special. I asked for a receipt to see the price break down, never got one. I will never be back at this location.~coke ( apple apple ~1
HAHcoyEk_YLahBCKFaI6Wg~XmvUQZZJ-d3qVSx1a-PceA~My experience here has been nothing short of bad.  1) In line for 10 minutes. As soon as it's my turn, they close the cash register on me and tell me to go to another line...not even asking a fellow cashier to take me first. This happened at least 3 times to me before I quit going there.  2) During coupon promotion...friday night...supper rush at 7pm...only 1 cash opened. But of course, there's nobody telling the customers that, so the lobby is jammed-packed with people standing randomly all over the place and we don't know where to lineup. No crowd control.  3) They don't respond to complaints. My friends and I have written numerous times and even asked for a follow up. No such luck. McDonald's head office sends them the feedback but that's as far as it goes. This is a privately-owned franchise that couldn't give a rat's ass.  4) Not the cleanest lobby either. Saturday night at 10pm, there are burger wrappers, ketchup stains, and fries on the floor.  If you're a Brossard-er that really needs a McDonald's fix, then there is a new one at Dix30 and another one in the C-Section near the highway (behind Maxi). Those are likely better options. Wal-mart one is good too, but has a limited menu.~burger fries ~1

As is often my custom, I've only ever ordered one dish, the "spicy" Pad Thai. It has never one been spicy, but it's always been delicious.  Not amazing food, but good portions and reasonable prices.~thai. ~3
Cu9fWbuFQKwVY13Spe5FiA~2rD343F4IRbcqibIo1OtTQ~Eating at this restaurant is the only thing I miss about working in the Financial District. Okay, maybe getting a steady paycheque too. But other than that, I dearly miss not being able to enjoy their food on a regular basis.  If you want good Cantonese meals, come here. Be advised that the lunch hour is the most chaotic time. Expect a line up of people waiting to be seated from 11:45am to 1:30pm, respectively. But the restaurant does a great job at keeping the flow moving so you never have to wait long for a table.   If you prefer to eat outside or bring the food back to your desk, they have take-out.   The majority of the patrons are suits but don't let this deter you from going. It has a very relaxing atmosphere, and you get a variety of people who work in the area who want to enjoy a simple meal when not in Chinatown.  My friend and I would always share a plate of deep-fried squid (the best I think in the city), and stir-fried veggies. With a complimentary green tea and a pop, our order came up to $20. Also, their curry chicken dish and crispy noodles are excellent.   Try this place, you won't be disappointed.~tea chicken ~4
6PY-s0tGcK7VaRxBgu5veg~laRjNqtV92lIUKXy4HOmiQ~Nice station. Always clean, with very friendly staff. My husband regularly stops here for coffee and a snack on his way to work. They have a car wash, and there is a Redbox out front. PLEASE be careful pulling in and out of this location, however. The entrance drive is just not wide enough, and people turn in and out fairly far toward the middle. This leaves you open to being hit even if you are actually in your lane. Just a heads up.~coffee ~4
6PY-s0tGcK7VaRxBgu5veg~ShHcheR48qvu3rdjpB_UgA~It's a brand new Circle K gas station right in front of Bi Lo. It's a very convent location right off of prosperity church rd. They keep it really clean/spotless. They have huge coffee bar in side with gigantic wall full of cooler where you would find varieties of soft drinks, energy drink, beers etc. They also have lottery and cigarettes. The lady at the counter was very friendly. I only stop by to get me some G on my way to volleyball on Saturday.~coffee ~4

I didn't eat any of them, & this place was really no different than any other Applebees (except that someone opened the door upon arrival & closed it behind us).  They also had a nice touch to the "shamrock MD purchase" in that they advertised help for 1 specific boy & had pictures of him on the wall.~shrimp - shrimp ~2

We came here on a Sunday night and there was nobody in the restaurant at all. We ordered 2 hot chocolates and somebody spilled it all. Then there was the soup. We ordered the french onion soup and it was horrible! I'm going to stop you there because the rest is the same. Way to much salt on some dishes and others were extremely bland.~soup. onion soup ~2
5kCIKF4swROPb1YRAJfsfw~BAnyh2byrBAZIMt6l1TF4w~We arrived February 11th at 6:00 and despite a moderate crowd, we had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  Not a big deal at first but turned out to be a good indication of what was to come:  server took awhile to get drink orders, and every step of the process was abysmal!  Waiter seemed to be totally inexperienced!  :(   soup finally came out cold but my wife had to walk it back because waiter never came to check on how it was!   And we had to ask where soup was cause it was supposed to come before the dinner.   Even getting the check was a hassle.  My wife had to find the waitervto get our bill!   The experience almost ruined the night for taking so long and ended up at McDonalds for coffee and dessert instead of here.   Food was otherwise not too bad.  Tomato basil soup, on 2nd try, was at least a full bowl (1st was maybe half full in small bowls) but tasty.  I had 550 cal sizzling chili chicken, (very small) side order of rice and beans which was at leasr cheap and wife had low cal chichen dish which she said was ok other than not liking how broccoli was cooked (too much of the garlic seasoning).  All in all: $50 was grossly too much to pay for the food and even moreso for horrendous service.   It took over an hour, maybe hour & 15 minutes!   STAY AWAY at least for dinner.   My wife works in Solon and has enjoyed quick lunch service at this location.~soup soup coffee tomato soup, chicken, broccoli garlic ~1
5kCIKF4swROPb1YRAJfsfw~f1GPW5qqFAZhYxkqH30_dA~A trend in reviews and comments I have heard in the restaurant.....bad food.  I like Applebees as a chain, but I've decided to not go to this one any longer.  I've had a few meals here with friends and family.  Almost always a meal is sent back because things are under or over cooked or very bland.  Cold shrimp, soggy fried shrimp and stale items on salads are just a few reasons I won't go here again.  Also, my last visit we did not send anything back to the kitchen, but two tables around us did.  Just not up to the standards that Applebees should be expecting.~shrimp, shrimp salads ~1
0LKcSabd5Gd5oz-qrHTzZg~LvsWtTYo4YKcQkyLJaYhGg~My buddy was DJing on Saturday night at Cin Cin so I headed out with some friends.  I had already ate so just got some drinks which were poured very kindly.  One of my friends got a penne pasta with chicken and chipotle sauce that he said was good and very spicy.  There was a decent crowd all night then at 2am a huge amount of people came in and it was really going for about an hour and a half till closing time.  Overall a cool little restaurant/club.~pasta chicken ~4
0LKcSabd5Gd5oz-qrHTzZg~_Lb4xwtZ0MhCUYQzQfmRJw~The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is a friend of a friend is part owner, and I respect that.   It's not my scene, and that I know, but decided to check it out since I was offered discounted drinks and food. How can you turn that down even in Old Town?  Still suffering from a hang over from the night before I order a gin and tonic, which is a sign I feel like shit. The drinks were nicely pored, and I can't say that's a norm, because I sorta had a connection here. I was a little hungry and split a chicken quesadilla with my friend, it was mediocre and boring. No flare, just straight up bland looking.  I immediately thought, "why not throw a little diced cilantro and red bell pepper on top for color?"  The crowd here is what you expect in old town, and the music is just rap and hip hop. I mean, this place can be cool, I think they should shoot for a lounge feeling with cool jazz and mellow music, and let the clubs do the club thing I think this is a starter place for most Scottsdillians prior to hitting Old Town and it's very small and quaint, so one douchebag can ruin the entire place.   I can see the potential of this place, and respect it, however it's truly not my thing.~chicken cilantro bell pepper ~3
0LKcSabd5Gd5oz-qrHTzZg~uNR2l27Cwz83PLWnQOKJeA~is it a restaurant or a bar? i am not sure. we went there late night because we asked around and it was one of the few places that still advertised having a kitchen open, it seemed like over 70% of the menu was "sold out"......sold out form last week? we looked around the restaurant to see what everyone one was eating and it looked like food from everywhere in old town except cin cin kitchen. Joe's pizza looked good 2 guests were enjoying it and another table was eating cheesesteaks so we went to Philly Sandwich and wrote that place off as a huge waste of time.   attn. owner- spend less on the bouncing staff (gorillas) and put the money into keeping your kitchen stocked, would have loved to try the food....... if there was any....i can get a 9 dollar G&T any where in oldtown~pizza sandwich ~1
0LKcSabd5Gd5oz-qrHTzZg~hoy27cpAXJxjmmM4TbN5uA~Cin Cin pronounced CHIN CHIN which means cheers in Italian!  This is a great little bistro type lounge. It is a posh little lounge with unique little decorations and a small patio great for small groups.  The food here is excellent the service is good and this place is never real busy so it is a nice place to enjoy a quick bite before you do the club scene so you don't get extremely wasted on an empty stomach, a great little starter place for you and some friends.  The location is great too, right across from the W and and down the street from Axis N Radius, Suede, and PCL. This is definitely a good spot to meet at for before binge drinking in old town.   I got a bottle of Pelgrino water and the stuff portabello mushroom, with the vinaigrette spinach. This was excellent probably one of the better portabello mushroom meals I have eaten around the valley.~mushroom, spinach. mushroom ~4
3e-M7oQWILM9xbpx9fyUWQ~y5oKFXCtAPEYJEALkigUAQ~A great Brampton find for Italian food! I had my first visit earlier this week and I can't wait to go again.  Decor is a little outdated There is no bar area, or draft beer  Service was a little sparse at times But the food was great  We came here on a recommendation and we were told to just order off the specials board. And trust that you can find something for anyone on the board, including lots and lots of seafood! I was surprised it was so busy for a weekday night.  For apps we ordered: Spicy scallops and Portabello mushrooms  Scallops were perfection, loved the sauce and easy on the spice. Scallops were mixed with onions and beans with a side of greens. Definitely loved the beans for the different textures Wasn't too crazy about the cheese sauce the mushrooms were in though. I love mushrooms but wouldn't order this again.  Entrees were: Lobster linguini and Seafood risotto  Pasta was good, good portion. Personally I would've loved more lobster, but who wouldn't? Risotto was awesome. Came out super hot and had a generous portion of seafood (squid, scallops, mussels and shrimp) yum!~mushrooms greens. cheese mushrooms mushrooms risotto pasta risotto shrimp) ~4
3e-M7oQWILM9xbpx9fyUWQ~w9JZ0xwiYIUU-pZKIC81Ww~My sibling had her birthday here on the weekend.  It looked like everyone else did too.  The place was jammed to capacity for the evening.  Very family friendly and very nice staff putting up with (specifically my family) customers and their orders/questions.  Too many specials to name - chalkboards are littered all over the restaurant to help you find something if you can't narrow down a meal on the menu.  To say the portions are large is an understatement.  I started with Spicy Scallops and the vessel was packed with spicy goodness.  Scallops had little flavour but the bean/spice mixture more than made up for that.  My pops ordered the 3" Osso Bucco (I luckily stuck with the 2") and the serving was the size of a small person's head: no lie.  Your choice of side (pasta, veggies or risotto) is equal to if not larger than the main. It was almost comical.  But crazy cheap for your portion size - you could easily eat three times with what you get.  The actual shank was not bad.    No beers on draft, but they carry Moretti.  They do have a wine selection, but not much of a bar.~pasta, risotto) ~3
3e-M7oQWILM9xbpx9fyUWQ~zfDdZqZDRn9acRGfLGKoSw~Amazing food amazing service.. best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. Plates/Bowls are huge. Olive oil and bread on the table .. very nice.   The only Italian food that is better is my mother in laws real home made pasta and pepper sauce.~olive pasta ~4
-DJpOLL31G-lq3ALlWgZlA~pw1R3O03Gh92Yb_dLEM1Zw~Petsmart located in Woodbine/Hwy 7 is the usual location where I pick up some toys, some treats and some can food for my dog.  I really enjoy shopping there because the store is spacious so all dogs are welcome to drop in with their owners. Nothing beat a wet, snowy day when your dog has been indoors from all these time to go out and socialize with other people and dogs and shopping at the same time!  They do carry a few decent brand of dog food that I don't mind getting.. e.g Blue Buffalo (http://www.bluebuff.com/) and they have the oven baked cookies treats too...  Make sure you get the free Pet Perks card so you will get specials pricing for some of the products and they will mail you $5 off coupons once in awhile too!~cookies ~3
3hWKH-_7K2JhMQQBGxA4aA~GubA_TOWZnynmR23c7mwNw~This shop offers a hodge podge of services/items.  They offer body wraps, 3 levels of UV tanning, and spray tanning.  When you walk into the lobby, there's a a shelf of tanning lotions and tanning related products as well as a sunglass tower and purses hanging on the wall.  The staff that works here is friendly and extremely casual....which is good and bad.  It's good that they remember your name and seem pleased to see you, but it's bad that they assume you don't mind waiting for them to finish a personal phone conversation before they assist you.  I've been tanning in their level 1 UV beds and am pleased with the results.  They only have two beds, but I've never had to wait too long.  They don't offer any of the "modern conveniences" of other tanning salons like stickers or built in radios, but the beds get you tan so what else can you ask for?!~wraps, ~3
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~t8FmkV-AWZfmidXzkLegqA~The food was disgusting, waited 45 mins to even get our waters,  and my pas thai tasted like it came frozen out of a carton from trader Joe's.  Not good.~thai ~2
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~wCce992JQqPRK8gSnGav9g~good pad tai. wanton soup was relish. crab Rangoon was awesome would go back for sure.~soup crab rangoon ~5
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~_t2EZajelRhhh8PHYyoYOA~Lunch may be crowded and a bit slow as they get organized, but at dinnertime last Saturday, the restaurant was empty.  I've eaten here twice now and think it's a great find.  We had the sushi boat.  There was more than enough for two and all of it was super-fresh and delicious.  Park right around the corner on the side street.  .~sushi ~5
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~ptuYR2KcCzBQ4yma_IO49g~This gem just opened up a month ago. Sister restaurant to the one in Oakland (I've never been).   We both ordered Pad Thai (8 spicey) and Tom Yum Soup. FANTASTIC! Love seeing amazing food at very affordable prices, but even better to see it so close to where we live downtown.   A few things people may have contention with: the sushi bar is currently closed (but it's a Thai restaurant sooo...who cares?) and it is BYOB, which is fine because I have plenty of B I don't mind B'ing. That was really just a PSA for those who would like to know. If it changes I will update.   My recommendation: Don't pass this place up. It has a bit of class, and a whole lot of flavor!  (Just kidding about the "who cares" . Could always use another sushi bar, but it doesn't affect my score one bit!)~thai ( soup. sushi thai sushi ~5
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~4Q_4YRZKirXPF2062pMPnw~I ordered Red Curry with beef from the lunch specials.  It had lots of fresh vegetables, good quality beef, and a delicious red curry sauce that was just the right level of spicy (I ordered a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10).  My friend had chicken pad thai (spicy = 9), which she said was very good.  The space is pleasant and clean, and there are lots of booths.  My only issue is that with a fairly busy (not packed) dining room, there seemed to be only one waitress and she was quite busy.  We had a bit of a delay in getting our check.  Hopefully they will increase the staffing a bit to account for the downtown lunch rush.~beef beef, chicken thai ( ~3
4R5P-H4bfPjkocOY1W5SZA~yeAIJN9Ot7I3ps_DVv7hmQ~I have had this place on my "must try" list for a while now and decided today was the day. When I walked through the door my first impression was "Wow, it's a lot larger on the inside than I thought it was." There was a bit of a crowd and at first I was going to wait to be seated but then I noticed
