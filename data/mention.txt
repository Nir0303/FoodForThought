This place is a area staple! Been around for years and not much has changed - I see this as a good thing! Stable and reliable!  My family goes every year for St. Pattys Day corn beef! Very nice place for a bar night dinner, or to catch up with some friends over drinks!~corn 
I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed.   One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price! Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app. The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection. They got the spears vs. chips decision right!  The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share!    And here's the kicker they were under four bucks!   Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!  The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft! And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.    I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.  The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done. When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share. My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.  The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.  Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented! I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.  That move garnered the fifth star!  We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!~i believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the broccoli lemon potato broccoli lettuce romaine carrot tomato 
I can't give this palce 5 stars because hell, its just not a 5 star place.  But it's the Pickle!  If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap, quality food (you get what you pay for though), a typical old bar atmosphere, free popcorn, and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5.  The place is awesome, I'm there every weekend.~popcorn 
***for lounge only****  Maybe I like this place only because my friend and I stumbled upon this place during happy hour.  Oh the two best words ever.  We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear.  I liked mine since it's tart as I like it but my friend didn't care for it. She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet.  We were going to have dinner so we didn't splurge on appetizers but the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices.  I took a peek and it looked like it was good since they ate every bite of their sushi rolls.  Bartender was really nice as well.  Noted, maybe on a weekend this place is poppin' but I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night.~asian pear 
I love the decor and vibe of Khotan. A little hard to find at first but once you enter, it's worth the search. I really liked the safe deposit boxes in the entryway - made for some cute pictures.  Food: Yum! I think it *may* be hit or miss based on reading other reviews but we chose wisely. Here's what I liked: Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fish Curry noodles - love the curry they used, definitely singaporean. big shrimps.  Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors. Service: Great! Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food. This would be a great date spot. I'll be back to enjoy the atmosphere :)~ginger broccoli date 
Worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size of a box of Tic Tacs with chewy rice and a rectangular layer of raw fish on the top. Bland, difficult to eat. We were hoping it was the same chef as Social House (restaurant at what is now Khotan's spot) because there was a jalapeno yellowtail sashimi on the menu (like the amazing one we'd had at Social House two years ago). The jalapeno yellowtail sashimi was actually excellent. The rest of the meal was totally downhill. When we started walking upstairs to get our table, the maitre 'd called out, "Watch your step because if you fall, I'd have to laugh at you." So, they can't make sushi and they have some clueless staffers too. Don't waste your time or if you insist on going, try the hot foods versus the sushi rolls.~worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size jalapeno jalapeno sushi sushi 
My girlfriend and I stayed at TI and we were looking for an easy dinner one night, so we decided to stroll into Khotan.  Meh...  I wouldn't say the food was bad, but it wasn't good.  I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish.  It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen, or that they used high quality fish.  Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!  The service was pretty good, but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish.  Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.  The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good, but when eating it, the Parmesan didn't make sense.  I was in the mood for noodles, so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein.  It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top.  I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good, or better, than their $14 dish.~my girlfriend and i stayed at ti and we sushi 
Only 4 stars because of the expense--without our $55 Groupon, our meal for two, including one large house sake, would have been over $100.  However, even if we hadn't had the Groupon, it would have been WELL worth the money. What a find!! The decor is gorgeous, we were waited on by two attentive garcons (sat at the sushi bar so chatted with the sushi chefs as well), and the menu is extremely creative and--most importantly--DELICIOUS.   Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light, yummy sauce and WOW was he right. We both "mm'd" through our whole meal, starting right from the tasty beginning.   Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh, generous and absolutely fantastic.   By the time we finished our large dinner order we were almost full, but definitely not ready to stop eating! We each ordered another round of nigiri--my boyfriend got tuna and I got salmon, YUM!  What a hidden gem...thanks to Groupon for helping us find this one! We will DEFINITELY be returning next time we're in Vegas.~sushi sushi sushi sushi 
Sushi was very average and very expensive with no wow factor. Tasted just "bleh". Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat. Took a long time to get the salad. We asked to sit on the balcony to watch the show and they gave us a table at the backside so we couldn't see. Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long.~sushi was very average and very expensive with no miso ginger lettuce 
I can't say from my experience that I understand the mediocre reviews for Khotan. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We didn't have the sushi and stuck to mainstream pekinese type dishes; lettuce wraps, edamame (ok, they're Japaneze), lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken, all of which were fresh and tasty.   I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint. It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal. I am going to brutally honest here and suggest what is expensive to a TI guest is not the same to a Bellagio one ( we are neither by the way).   Give this place a try. We really liked it.~sushi lettuce edamame jasmine 
Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it.  I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.  The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.  We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.  We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was "eh," very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.  I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service, but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back.  If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view, however, this is your place.~broccoli brown 
We stumbled upon khotan by pure laziness...We were watching the TI show (wow...not kid friendly anymore) and gambled a little before we started getting some hunger pangs.  So we wandered a little bit and saw the downstairs opening for this place.  We thought it was a small casual place and had no idea it was considered upscale dining.  The host greeted us then talked into his ear radio....He then escorted us to the elevator and sent us up.  We were then greeted by another host and seated in the bar area since it was a quiet sunday night.  We just needed a few bites to eat so we could make our flight without starving.  Started off w. some edamame (the norm, nothing crazy) then we shared chicken lollipops (not bad), kobe sliders (looked dry but were actually moist), gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which but it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles...terrible).  It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location...right in front of us as we were about to give up looking...  Food was good but not memorable. (well except the super awful noodle dish)~edamame 
The restaurant was pretty slick, great atmosphere and a really cool patio. If you happen to go for dinner the pirate show is pretty cool since you are watching it from the back side of the boats. The Edamame was really buttery and apps were spot on. The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet.   The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place. The food was so so, but the drinks, app and atmosphere were great.    Worth a visit and they frequently have Groupons and happy hour specials.~edamame ginger 
We used a Groupon to try out this restaurant in TI.  We sat at a table on the patio to watch the 8pm Sirens show.    Pros: - nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.) - decent variety of food selections and full bar - decor and ambience were pretty nice  Cons: - food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.   - service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.  She disappeared for a bit while we ate and my husband had to go to the kitchen to get more soy sauce.  We eventually had to call out the Mgr to ask for service, and things got better after that.  He was very apologetic and checked in to make sure things were OK.    I think if we hadn't had the Groupon, we would have not come here.  Without the Groupon, we would have spent the $200 elsewhere and received much better quality food and service.  I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour.~we used a groupon to try out this restaurant lettuce 
I ate at Khotan tonight with my husband, sister-in-law and her husband. We were there to use our Groupons before they expired.The service was really good. So was the lighting. We ordered the sliders, Tom Yum with chicken and the crispy asparagus to start. The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended. The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick. We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the "fry."  For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp. All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama. We were expecting it to be hot. It was cold. Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp. Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad. Just wasn't what we were expecting.  Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense.   The restaurant is beautiful. Worth a try. Don't expect miracles.~asparagus ginger asparagus thai mango coconut 
This place is weird.  So we were greeted by the hostess in front who looked like she was wearing butt pads.  No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here?   The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.    I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average.   Even if money grew on my orange tree, I wouldn't come here again though.~sushi 
Much MUCH better as Social House.  What the hell was TI thinking?  SH was more Japanese influenced, I would say Khotan is more Chinese influenced, with a Japanese pricetag.    Grub: *Jalapeno Hamachi, not as buttery & fresh as I'm used to, soy overpowered, I liked the battered jalapeno slices, great texture, $22 *Rainbow Roll, snow crab & fish were not fresh, $18 *Broccoli Beef, liked the Broccoli Rabe aspect, the beef was eh, $24 *Gai Lan, cooked nicely, & not too greasy, $6 *Crab Lo Mein Alfredo, really strange, like the powdered packet in Hamburger Helper, but oddly comforting, $14  This place is pretty pathetic, but they serve a mean cocktail & boast a great alfresco dining option.~jalapeno jalapeno broccoli broccoli 
Was craving sushi after walking around the outdoor mall at Treasure Island. Just happened to come across this place. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily good either. Decor is nice, service is average, the bartender was cool though. For the price they charge I would pass on this place. I know it's Vegas but there's some standards you would expect based on the price and the food just didn't meet the standards in my opinion.~was craving sushi after walking around the outdoor mall 
I came here back when it was social house, and now Khotan. I tell you it's like night and day. And I don't mean that in a good way. While the decor hasn't really changed much. The menu sure has and not for the better. My experience here while being social house was so wonderful. I figured regardless of the name changing I'd give it a shot. Boy was I wrong. Like I mentioned before the decor is still unique. Dim, sheik, very Asian like of course. But wait, they use to have a dj in the lounge area. Gone, go figure. And the waitresses from what I remember were a lot nicer. Anyway. I ordered a few sushi pieces, with some chicken like kabobs. I believe a salad. Had a few beers. Sushi was very Mediocre. Chicken was dry. Salad was salad. Can't really remember anything memorable from my meal. Aside from the overpriced food. A big disappointment. I doubt I'll be coming here again. Only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because it was once social house. Anyway if over priced wanna be asian food is your gig. Along with half ass service. Be my guest.~i came here back when it was social house sushi sushi
